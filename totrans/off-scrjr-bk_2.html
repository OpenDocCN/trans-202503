<br />
GETTING STARTED</strong>
</h2>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="noindent">Welcome to ScratchJr! The projects that you can make with ScratchJr are limited only by your imagination. If you can dream it, you can make it.</p>
<p class="indent">This chapter will teach you the basics of using ScratchJr, and together we’ll make a dance party! You’ll learn how <a id="page_8"></a>
 to make characters move and speak, how to change the background, and how to save your work so you can build on it again or share it with your friends. You’ll also learn how to delete objects and undo steps.</p>
<p class="indent">After finishing this chapter, you’ll know your way around the ScratchJr interface, and you’ll know how to use the programming blocks to bring your characters to life.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec10">
<strong>ACTIVITY 1: THROW A DANCE PARTY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s get the ScratchJr cat to dance with a friend on a stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">This chapter will show you how to set up and complete your first project.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec01"><a id="page_9"></a>
 <strong>STEP 1: OPEN THE APP</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This is the first screen you’ll see when you open the ScratchJr app. Tap the <strong>Home</strong>
 button on the left.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec02">
<strong>STEP 2: MAKE A NEW PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The home screen shows all of your saved ScratchJr projects. In the following picture, you can see two projects that have already been created. If this is your first project, you’ll see only the plus sign. Tap the plus sign to make a new project.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_10"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec03">
<strong>STEP 3: MAKE THE CAT MOVE!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This is where the magic happens! You can make amazing animations, silly stories, and great games—all from the ScratchJr editor. Whatever you make will play in the center of the screen. We call this area the <em>stage</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_11"></a>
 Each new project starts with the ScratchJr cat. To make the cat move, we can use the <em>motion blocks</em>
 , which are in the blue <em>palette</em>
 of programming blocks. Use your finger to drag one of the blue arrow blocks to the <em>programming area</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Tap the blue block, and the cat moves in the direction of the arrow!</p>
<p class="indent">You can drag more blocks to the programming area and snap them together to make a sequence of actions, which we call a <em>script</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Add some more blue motion blocks to make the cat dance. Can you guess what movement each block makes? Experiment to see which blocks make the best dance.</p>
<p class="indent">To run the script and see the cat dance, tap any of the blocks in the script. Notice that the script runs from the beginning no matter which block you tap, and each block is highlighted as it runs.</p>
<p class="indent">Congratulations! You just made your first computer program! Now let’s turn it into a dance party!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec04"><a id="page_12"></a>
 <strong>STEP 4: USE THE GREEN FLAG</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are other ways to make your project run besides tapping on scripts. You can also use the Start on Green Flag block to start your script.</p>
<p class="indent">First, tap the yellow button in the <em>block categories area</em>
 to show the <em>triggering blocks</em>
 . Select the <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, drag it to the programming area, and snap it onto the front of your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The cat will dance just like it did when you tapped on the script!</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that there are other triggering blocks. You’ll find out how to use these as you go through the other projects in this book.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec05"><a id="page_13"></a>
 <strong>STEP 5: ADD A BACKGROUND</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s get the cat to dance on a stage, instead of just a plain white background. Select a new background by tapping on the button with the blue sky and green grass at the top of the main screen. This is called the <em>Change Background button</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll see loads of backgrounds that you can choose from. For our dancing cat, let’s choose the theatre. Tap the check mark at the top to load it into your stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Congratulations! Your cat is a star!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_14"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">The cat is smiling and dancing, but it looks a bit lonely dancing on its own. . . .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec06">
<strong>STEP 6: ADD ANOTHER CHARACTER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s give your cat a friend. Tap the plus sign on the left side of your screen to add a character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_15"></a>
 If you scroll down the page, you’ll see the many characters you can choose from. Tap the character you want to add, and then tap the check mark to add it to your project. We’ve chosen the penguin.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now there are two characters on the stage. To the left of the stage is the <em>character area</em>
 , which shows you all the characters involved in your project.</p>
<p class="indent">The new character will always appear in the middle of the stage. To move the character, use your finger to drag it wherever you want on the stage. We’ve dragged each of our characters to a spotlight.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_16"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You might notice that the script you wrote for the cat disappeared after you selected a new character. Don’t worry: the script is still there! It’s in the cat’s programming area, and now the screen is showing the programming area for the penguin. Each character has its own scripts, like actors in a play. To see the cat’s script, tap the cat in the character area on the left, and you’ll see that your script is still there. Then select the penguin again so that you can give it dance moves of its own.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec07">
<strong>STEP 7: DON’T JUST DANCE, SAY SOMETHING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make the penguin say something before it dances. You can add speech bubbles for characters using the purple Say block. Tap the purple button in the block categories area to reveal the <em>looks blocks</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_17"></a>
 Drag the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Let’s change the text of the Say block from “hi” to “Let’s dance!” First, tap the word <em>hi</em>
 to make the keyboard appear. Use the backspace key to delete <em>hi</em>
 , and then type <strong>Let’s dance!</strong>
 or whatever you want the penguin to say.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_18"></a>
 Add some blue motion blocks to make the penguin dance, and then put a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block at the beginning of the penguin’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now try it out by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll see that the scripts for the cat and the penguin start running at the same time. When you tap the Green Flag button, it will run every script that begins with a Start on Green Flag block for every character, all at the same time. This will be really useful as you make bigger projects with more characters.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec08">
<strong>STEP 8: ADD A TITLE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can display a title on the stage by tapping the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen. In the window that pops up, type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can drag the title around the screen and place it anywhere you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 () and <strong>Change Color</strong>
 () buttons to change the size and color of the title you give your project. Play around and see what suits your stage best. Press <strong>Go</strong>
 to try it out on the stage. If you want to edit the title again, you can tap on the words to bring the text window back up.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_19"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec09">
<strong>STEP 9: NAME YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now give your project a name so that when you open ScratchJr again and see your projects on the home screen, you’ll know which project is which.</p>
<p class="indent">To name your project, tap the yellow tab in the top-right corner of the screen. Then delete the current project name (<em>Project 1</em>
 ) and type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 . When you’re ready to return to the main screen, tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<div class="image"><a id="page_20"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">If you want to send your project to someone else who has ScratchJr, you can do that from this screen too. For more details on how to share your projects, see the Frequently Asked Questions on the ScratchJr website (<em>
<a href="http://www.scratchjr.org/about.html#faq">http://www.scratchjr.org/about.html#faq</a>
</em>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You’re almost finished, but you have one important step left!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec10">
<strong>STEP 10: SAVE YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To save your project and go back to the home screen, tap the <strong>Home</strong>
 button () in the top-left corner. Your project will not be saved until you return to the home screen, so it’s a good idea to do this a few times while you are working on your project so that you don’t lose anything.</p>
<p class="indent">To continue working on your project, just tap the small image of the project on the home screen. This will take you back to the ScratchJr editor for that project.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec11"><a id="page_21"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The ScratchJr characters are all either facing forward or facing right when you first add them to your stage. If you want a character to face to the left, drag a Move Left block to the programming area and tap the block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The character will turn to the left and take a step. You can then delete this block and the character will continue to face left.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec12">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr makes different sounds when you perform different actions on the interface. These sounds can be very useful when you first start using ScratchJr. For example, when you have successfully snapped blocks together in a script, you’ll hear a “pop.” If you want to turn the sounds off, however, you can just turn the volume off on your device.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec11">
<strong>DON’T BE AFRAID TO EXPLORE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you explore the various features of ScratchJr, you should feel free to experiment, try new features, and test out new blocks. You can make your project whatever you want it to be in many ways: you could move your party to the beach, put a boat in the background, add more characters, or do almost anything else you want to do. A good feature of ScratchJr is that if you decide you don’t like any of the changes you’ve made, you can easily get rid of them.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ll show you some simple ways to do this.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec13"><a id="page_22"></a>
 <strong>UNDOING AND REDOING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can undo your most recent actions by tapping the Undo button at the far end of the blocks palette. If you tap the Undo button multiple times, you will undo more and more of your work, one step at a time.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If you’ve undone several steps, the Redo button will reverse the most recent Undo.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec14">
<strong>DELETING OBJECTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To delete something from ScratchJr, press it with your finger and hold it for a few seconds (sometimes called a <em>long press</em>
 ) until you see a red X appear on the object. Tap the X to delete the object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use this process to delete a character within a project or even delete an entire project from the home screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec15">
<strong>DELETING BLOCKS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To get rid of a block or even a whole script from the programming area, just drag it back up to the blocks palette and let go. You can have any color palette showing to do this; the palette doesn’t have to be the same color as the blocks you are deleting.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec12"><a id="page_23"></a>
 <strong>A GUIDED TOUR OF THE SCRATCHJR INTERFACE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have a good grasp of the basics, you can take a look at all the buttons and features. Try a few of the ones we skipped earlier. If you feel overwhelmed, don’t worry: the rest of the book’s projects will show you how to use everything! It’s okay to skip ahead and refer back here when you need to.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s start with the buttons at the top of the editor.</p>

<p class="indent">This chapter will teach you the basics of using ScratchJr, and together we’ll make a dance party! You’ll learn how <a id="page_8"></a>
 to make characters move and speak, how to change the background, and how to save your work so you can build on it again or share it with your friends. You’ll also learn how to delete objects and undo steps.</p>
<p class="indent">After finishing this chapter, you’ll know your way around the ScratchJr interface, and you’ll know how to use the programming blocks to bring your characters to life.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec10">
<strong>ACTIVITY 1: THROW A DANCE PARTY!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s get the ScratchJr cat to dance with a friend on a stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">This chapter will show you how to set up and complete your first project.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec01"><a id="page_9"></a>
 <strong>STEP 1: OPEN THE APP</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This is the first screen you’ll see when you open the ScratchJr app. Tap the <strong>Home</strong>
 button on the left.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec02">
<strong>STEP 2: MAKE A NEW PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The home screen shows all of your saved ScratchJr projects. In the following picture, you can see two projects that have already been created. If this is your first project, you’ll see only the plus sign. Tap the plus sign to make a new project.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_10"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec03">
<strong>STEP 3: MAKE THE CAT MOVE!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This is where the magic happens! You can make amazing animations, silly stories, and great games—all from the ScratchJr editor. Whatever you make will play in the center of the screen. We call this area the <em>stage</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_11"></a>
 Each new project starts with the ScratchJr cat. To make the cat move, we can use the <em>motion blocks</em>
 , which are in the blue <em>palette</em>
 of programming blocks. Use your finger to drag one of the blue arrow blocks to the <em>programming area</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Tap the blue block, and the cat moves in the direction of the arrow!</p>
<p class="indent">You can drag more blocks to the programming area and snap them together to make a sequence of actions, which we call a <em>script</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Add some more blue motion blocks to make the cat dance. Can you guess what movement each block makes? Experiment to see which blocks make the best dance.</p>
<p class="indent">To run the script and see the cat dance, tap any of the blocks in the script. Notice that the script runs from the beginning no matter which block you tap, and each block is highlighted as it runs.</p>
<p class="indent">Congratulations! You just made your first computer program! Now let’s turn it into a dance party!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec04"><a id="page_12"></a>
 <strong>STEP 4: USE THE GREEN FLAG</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are other ways to make your project run besides tapping on scripts. You can also use the Start on Green Flag block to start your script.</p>
<p class="indent">First, tap the yellow button in the <em>block categories area</em>
 to show the <em>triggering blocks</em>
 . Select the <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, drag it to the programming area, and snap it onto the front of your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The cat will dance just like it did when you tapped on the script!</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that there are other triggering blocks. You’ll find out how to use these as you go through the other projects in this book.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec05"><a id="page_13"></a>
 <strong>STEP 5: ADD A BACKGROUND</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s get the cat to dance on a stage, instead of just a plain white background. Select a new background by tapping on the button with the blue sky and green grass at the top of the main screen. This is called the <em>Change Background button</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll see loads of backgrounds that you can choose from. For our dancing cat, let’s choose the theatre. Tap the check mark at the top to load it into your stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Congratulations! Your cat is a star!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_14"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">The cat is smiling and dancing, but it looks a bit lonely dancing on its own. . . .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec06">
<strong>STEP 6: ADD ANOTHER CHARACTER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s give your cat a friend. Tap the plus sign on the left side of your screen to add a character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_15"></a>
 If you scroll down the page, you’ll see the many characters you can choose from. Tap the character you want to add, and then tap the check mark to add it to your project. We’ve chosen the penguin.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now there are two characters on the stage. To the left of the stage is the <em>character area</em>
 , which shows you all the characters involved in your project.</p>
<p class="indent">The new character will always appear in the middle of the stage. To move the character, use your finger to drag it wherever you want on the stage. We’ve dragged each of our characters to a spotlight.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_16"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You might notice that the script you wrote for the cat disappeared after you selected a new character. Don’t worry: the script is still there! It’s in the cat’s programming area, and now the screen is showing the programming area for the penguin. Each character has its own scripts, like actors in a play. To see the cat’s script, tap the cat in the character area on the left, and you’ll see that your script is still there. Then select the penguin again so that you can give it dance moves of its own.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec07">
<strong>STEP 7: DON’T JUST DANCE, SAY SOMETHING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make the penguin say something before it dances. You can add speech bubbles for characters using the purple Say block. Tap the purple button in the block categories area to reveal the <em>looks blocks</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_17"></a>
 Drag the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Let’s change the text of the Say block from “hi” to “Let’s dance!” First, tap the word <em>hi</em>
 to make the keyboard appear. Use the backspace key to delete <em>hi</em>
 , and then type <strong>Let’s dance!</strong>
 or whatever you want the penguin to say.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_18"></a>
 Add some blue motion blocks to make the penguin dance, and then put a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block at the beginning of the penguin’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now try it out by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll see that the scripts for the cat and the penguin start running at the same time. When you tap the Green Flag button, it will run every script that begins with a Start on Green Flag block for every character, all at the same time. This will be really useful as you make bigger projects with more characters.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec08">
<strong>STEP 8: ADD A TITLE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can display a title on the stage by tapping the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen. In the window that pops up, type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can drag the title around the screen and place it anywhere you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 () and <strong>Change Color</strong>
 () buttons to change the size and color of the title you give your project. Play around and see what suits your stage best. Press <strong>Go</strong>
 to try it out on the stage. If you want to edit the title again, you can tap on the words to bring the text window back up.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_19"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec09">
<strong>STEP 9: NAME YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now give your project a name so that when you open ScratchJr again and see your projects on the home screen, you’ll know which project is which.</p>
<p class="indent">To name your project, tap the yellow tab in the top-right corner of the screen. Then delete the current project name (<em>Project 1</em>
 ) and type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 . When you’re ready to return to the main screen, tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<div class="image"><a id="page_20"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">If you want to send your project to someone else who has ScratchJr, you can do that from this screen too. For more details on how to share your projects, see the Frequently Asked Questions on the ScratchJr website (<em>
<a href="http://www.scratchjr.org/about.html#faq">http://www.scratchjr.org/about.html#faq</a>
</em>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You’re almost finished, but you have one important step left!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec10">
<strong>STEP 10: SAVE YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To save your project and go back to the home screen, tap the <strong>Home</strong>
 button () in the top-left corner. Your project will not be saved until you return to the home screen, so it’s a good idea to do this a few times while you are working on your project so that you don’t lose anything.</p>
<p class="indent">To continue working on your project, just tap the small image of the project on the home screen. This will take you back to the ScratchJr editor for that project.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec11"><a id="page_21"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The ScratchJr characters are all either facing forward or facing right when you first add them to your stage. If you want a character to face to the left, drag a Move Left block to the programming area and tap the block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The character will turn to the left and take a step. You can then delete this block and the character will continue to face left.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec12">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr makes different sounds when you perform different actions on the interface. These sounds can be very useful when you first start using ScratchJr. For example, when you have successfully snapped blocks together in a script, you’ll hear a “pop.” If you want to turn the sounds off, however, you can just turn the volume off on your device.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec11">
<strong>DON’T BE AFRAID TO EXPLORE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you explore the various features of ScratchJr, you should feel free to experiment, try new features, and test out new blocks. You can make your project whatever you want it to be in many ways: you could move your party to the beach, put a boat in the background, add more characters, or do almost anything else you want to do. A good feature of ScratchJr is that if you decide you don’t like any of the changes you’ve made, you can easily get rid of them.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ll show you some simple ways to do this.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec13"><a id="page_22"></a>
 <strong>UNDOING AND REDOING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can undo your most recent actions by tapping the Undo button at the far end of the blocks palette. If you tap the Undo button multiple times, you will undo more and more of your work, one step at a time.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If you’ve undone several steps, the Redo button will reverse the most recent Undo.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec14">
<strong>DELETING OBJECTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To delete something from ScratchJr, press it with your finger and hold it for a few seconds (sometimes called a <em>long press</em>
 ) until you see a red X appear on the object. Tap the X to delete the object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use this process to delete a character within a project or even delete an entire project from the home screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec15">
<strong>DELETING BLOCKS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To get rid of a block or even a whole script from the programming area, just drag it back up to the blocks palette and let go. You can have any color palette showing to do this; the palette doesn’t have to be the same color as the blocks you are deleting.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec12"><a id="page_23"></a>
 <strong>A GUIDED TOUR OF THE SCRATCHJR INTERFACE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have a good grasp of the basics, you can take a look at all the buttons and features. Try a few of the ones we skipped earlier. If you feel overwhelmed, don’t worry: the rest of the book’s projects will show you how to use everything! It’s okay to skip ahead and refer back here when you need to.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s start with the buttons at the top of the editor.</p>

<p class="noindent">The home screen shows all of your saved ScratchJr projects. In the following picture, you can see two projects that have already been created. If this is your first project, you’ll see only the plus sign. Tap the plus sign to make a new project.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_10"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec03">
<strong>STEP 3: MAKE THE CAT MOVE!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This is where the magic happens! You can make amazing animations, silly stories, and great games—all from the ScratchJr editor. Whatever you make will play in the center of the screen. We call this area the <em>stage</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_11"></a>
 Each new project starts with the ScratchJr cat. To make the cat move, we can use the <em>motion blocks</em>
 , which are in the blue <em>palette</em>
 of programming blocks. Use your finger to drag one of the blue arrow blocks to the <em>programming area</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Tap the blue block, and the cat moves in the direction of the arrow!</p>
<p class="indent">You can drag more blocks to the programming area and snap them together to make a sequence of actions, which we call a <em>script</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Add some more blue motion blocks to make the cat dance. Can you guess what movement each block makes? Experiment to see which blocks make the best dance.</p>
<p class="indent">To run the script and see the cat dance, tap any of the blocks in the script. Notice that the script runs from the beginning no matter which block you tap, and each block is highlighted as it runs.</p>
<p class="indent">Congratulations! You just made your first computer program! Now let’s turn it into a dance party!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec04"><a id="page_12"></a>
 <strong>STEP 4: USE THE GREEN FLAG</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are other ways to make your project run besides tapping on scripts. You can also use the Start on Green Flag block to start your script.</p>
<p class="indent">First, tap the yellow button in the <em>block categories area</em>
 to show the <em>triggering blocks</em>
 . Select the <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, drag it to the programming area, and snap it onto the front of your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The cat will dance just like it did when you tapped on the script!</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that there are other triggering blocks. You’ll find out how to use these as you go through the other projects in this book.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec05"><a id="page_13"></a>
 <strong>STEP 5: ADD A BACKGROUND</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s get the cat to dance on a stage, instead of just a plain white background. Select a new background by tapping on the button with the blue sky and green grass at the top of the main screen. This is called the <em>Change Background button</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll see loads of backgrounds that you can choose from. For our dancing cat, let’s choose the theatre. Tap the check mark at the top to load it into your stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Congratulations! Your cat is a star!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_14"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">The cat is smiling and dancing, but it looks a bit lonely dancing on its own. . . .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec06">
<strong>STEP 6: ADD ANOTHER CHARACTER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s give your cat a friend. Tap the plus sign on the left side of your screen to add a character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_15"></a>
 If you scroll down the page, you’ll see the many characters you can choose from. Tap the character you want to add, and then tap the check mark to add it to your project. We’ve chosen the penguin.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now there are two characters on the stage. To the left of the stage is the <em>character area</em>
 , which shows you all the characters involved in your project.</p>
<p class="indent">The new character will always appear in the middle of the stage. To move the character, use your finger to drag it wherever you want on the stage. We’ve dragged each of our characters to a spotlight.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_16"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You might notice that the script you wrote for the cat disappeared after you selected a new character. Don’t worry: the script is still there! It’s in the cat’s programming area, and now the screen is showing the programming area for the penguin. Each character has its own scripts, like actors in a play. To see the cat’s script, tap the cat in the character area on the left, and you’ll see that your script is still there. Then select the penguin again so that you can give it dance moves of its own.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec07">
<strong>STEP 7: DON’T JUST DANCE, SAY SOMETHING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make the penguin say something before it dances. You can add speech bubbles for characters using the purple Say block. Tap the purple button in the block categories area to reveal the <em>looks blocks</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_17"></a>
 Drag the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Let’s change the text of the Say block from “hi” to “Let’s dance!” First, tap the word <em>hi</em>
 to make the keyboard appear. Use the backspace key to delete <em>hi</em>
 , and then type <strong>Let’s dance!</strong>
 or whatever you want the penguin to say.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_18"></a>
 Add some blue motion blocks to make the penguin dance, and then put a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block at the beginning of the penguin’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now try it out by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll see that the scripts for the cat and the penguin start running at the same time. When you tap the Green Flag button, it will run every script that begins with a Start on Green Flag block for every character, all at the same time. This will be really useful as you make bigger projects with more characters.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec08">
<strong>STEP 8: ADD A TITLE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can display a title on the stage by tapping the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen. In the window that pops up, type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can drag the title around the screen and place it anywhere you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 () and <strong>Change Color</strong>
 () buttons to change the size and color of the title you give your project. Play around and see what suits your stage best. Press <strong>Go</strong>
 to try it out on the stage. If you want to edit the title again, you can tap on the words to bring the text window back up.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_19"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec09">
<strong>STEP 9: NAME YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now give your project a name so that when you open ScratchJr again and see your projects on the home screen, you’ll know which project is which.</p>
<p class="indent">To name your project, tap the yellow tab in the top-right corner of the screen. Then delete the current project name (<em>Project 1</em>
 ) and type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 . When you’re ready to return to the main screen, tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<div class="image"><a id="page_20"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">If you want to send your project to someone else who has ScratchJr, you can do that from this screen too. For more details on how to share your projects, see the Frequently Asked Questions on the ScratchJr website (<em>
<a href="http://www.scratchjr.org/about.html#faq">http://www.scratchjr.org/about.html#faq</a>
</em>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You’re almost finished, but you have one important step left!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec10">
<strong>STEP 10: SAVE YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To save your project and go back to the home screen, tap the <strong>Home</strong>
 button () in the top-left corner. Your project will not be saved until you return to the home screen, so it’s a good idea to do this a few times while you are working on your project so that you don’t lose anything.</p>
<p class="indent">To continue working on your project, just tap the small image of the project on the home screen. This will take you back to the ScratchJr editor for that project.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec11"><a id="page_21"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The ScratchJr characters are all either facing forward or facing right when you first add them to your stage. If you want a character to face to the left, drag a Move Left block to the programming area and tap the block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The character will turn to the left and take a step. You can then delete this block and the character will continue to face left.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec12">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr makes different sounds when you perform different actions on the interface. These sounds can be very useful when you first start using ScratchJr. For example, when you have successfully snapped blocks together in a script, you’ll hear a “pop.” If you want to turn the sounds off, however, you can just turn the volume off on your device.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec11">
<strong>DON’T BE AFRAID TO EXPLORE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you explore the various features of ScratchJr, you should feel free to experiment, try new features, and test out new blocks. You can make your project whatever you want it to be in many ways: you could move your party to the beach, put a boat in the background, add more characters, or do almost anything else you want to do. A good feature of ScratchJr is that if you decide you don’t like any of the changes you’ve made, you can easily get rid of them.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ll show you some simple ways to do this.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec13"><a id="page_22"></a>
 <strong>UNDOING AND REDOING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can undo your most recent actions by tapping the Undo button at the far end of the blocks palette. If you tap the Undo button multiple times, you will undo more and more of your work, one step at a time.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If you’ve undone several steps, the Redo button will reverse the most recent Undo.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec14">
<strong>DELETING OBJECTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To delete something from ScratchJr, press it with your finger and hold it for a few seconds (sometimes called a <em>long press</em>
 ) until you see a red X appear on the object. Tap the X to delete the object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use this process to delete a character within a project or even delete an entire project from the home screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec15">
<strong>DELETING BLOCKS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To get rid of a block or even a whole script from the programming area, just drag it back up to the blocks palette and let go. You can have any color palette showing to do this; the palette doesn’t have to be the same color as the blocks you are deleting.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec12"><a id="page_23"></a>
 <strong>A GUIDED TOUR OF THE SCRATCHJR INTERFACE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have a good grasp of the basics, you can take a look at all the buttons and features. Try a few of the ones we skipped earlier. If you feel overwhelmed, don’t worry: the rest of the book’s projects will show you how to use everything! It’s okay to skip ahead and refer back here when you need to.</p>

<p class="noindent">There are other ways to make your project run besides tapping on scripts. You can also use the Start on Green Flag block to start your script.</p>
<p class="indent">First, tap the yellow button in the <em>block categories area</em>
 to show the <em>triggering blocks</em>
 . Select the <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, drag it to the programming area, and snap it onto the front of your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The cat will dance just like it did when you tapped on the script!</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that there are other triggering blocks. You’ll find out how to use these as you go through the other projects in this book.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec05"><a id="page_13"></a>
 <strong>STEP 5: ADD A BACKGROUND</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s get the cat to dance on a stage, instead of just a plain white background. Select a new background by tapping on the button with the blue sky and green grass at the top of the main screen. This is called the <em>Change Background button</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll see loads of backgrounds that you can choose from. For our dancing cat, let’s choose the theatre. Tap the check mark at the top to load it into your stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Congratulations! Your cat is a star!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_14"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">The cat is smiling and dancing, but it looks a bit lonely dancing on its own. . . .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec06">
<strong>STEP 6: ADD ANOTHER CHARACTER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s give your cat a friend. Tap the plus sign on the left side of your screen to add a character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_15"></a>
 If you scroll down the page, you’ll see the many characters you can choose from. Tap the character you want to add, and then tap the check mark to add it to your project. We’ve chosen the penguin.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now there are two characters on the stage. To the left of the stage is the <em>character area</em>
 , which shows you all the characters involved in your project.</p>
<p class="indent">The new character will always appear in the middle of the stage. To move the character, use your finger to drag it wherever you want on the stage. We’ve dragged each of our characters to a spotlight.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_16"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You might notice that the script you wrote for the cat disappeared after you selected a new character. Don’t worry: the script is still there! It’s in the cat’s programming area, and now the screen is showing the programming area for the penguin. Each character has its own scripts, like actors in a play. To see the cat’s script, tap the cat in the character area on the left, and you’ll see that your script is still there. Then select the penguin again so that you can give it dance moves of its own.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec07">
<strong>STEP 7: DON’T JUST DANCE, SAY SOMETHING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make the penguin say something before it dances. You can add speech bubbles for characters using the purple Say block. Tap the purple button in the block categories area to reveal the <em>looks blocks</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_17"></a>
 Drag the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Let’s change the text of the Say block from “hi” to “Let’s dance!” First, tap the word <em>hi</em>
 to make the keyboard appear. Use the backspace key to delete <em>hi</em>
 , and then type <strong>Let’s dance!</strong>
 or whatever you want the penguin to say.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_18"></a>
 Add some blue motion blocks to make the penguin dance, and then put a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block at the beginning of the penguin’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now try it out by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll see that the scripts for the cat and the penguin start running at the same time. When you tap the Green Flag button, it will run every script that begins with a Start on Green Flag block for every character, all at the same time. This will be really useful as you make bigger projects with more characters.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec08">
<strong>STEP 8: ADD A TITLE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can display a title on the stage by tapping the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen. In the window that pops up, type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can drag the title around the screen and place it anywhere you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 () and <strong>Change Color</strong>
 () buttons to change the size and color of the title you give your project. Play around and see what suits your stage best. Press <strong>Go</strong>
 to try it out on the stage. If you want to edit the title again, you can tap on the words to bring the text window back up.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_19"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec09">
<strong>STEP 9: NAME YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now give your project a name so that when you open ScratchJr again and see your projects on the home screen, you’ll know which project is which.</p>
<p class="indent">To name your project, tap the yellow tab in the top-right corner of the screen. Then delete the current project name (<em>Project 1</em>
 ) and type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 . When you’re ready to return to the main screen, tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<div class="image"><a id="page_20"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">If you want to send your project to someone else who has ScratchJr, you can do that from this screen too. For more details on how to share your projects, see the Frequently Asked Questions on the ScratchJr website (<em>
<a href="http://www.scratchjr.org/about.html#faq">http://www.scratchjr.org/about.html#faq</a>
</em>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You’re almost finished, but you have one important step left!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec10">
<strong>STEP 10: SAVE YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To save your project and go back to the home screen, tap the <strong>Home</strong>
 button () in the top-left corner. Your project will not be saved until you return to the home screen, so it’s a good idea to do this a few times while you are working on your project so that you don’t lose anything.</p>
<p class="indent">To continue working on your project, just tap the small image of the project on the home screen. This will take you back to the ScratchJr editor for that project.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec11"><a id="page_21"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The ScratchJr characters are all either facing forward or facing right when you first add them to your stage. If you want a character to face to the left, drag a Move Left block to the programming area and tap the block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The character will turn to the left and take a step. You can then delete this block and the character will continue to face left.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec12">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr makes different sounds when you perform different actions on the interface. These sounds can be very useful when you first start using ScratchJr. For example, when you have successfully snapped blocks together in a script, you’ll hear a “pop.” If you want to turn the sounds off, however, you can just turn the volume off on your device.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec11">
<strong>DON’T BE AFRAID TO EXPLORE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you explore the various features of ScratchJr, you should feel free to experiment, try new features, and test out new blocks. You can make your project whatever you want it to be in many ways: you could move your party to the beach, put a boat in the background, add more characters, or do almost anything else you want to do. A good feature of ScratchJr is that if you decide you don’t like any of the changes you’ve made, you can easily get rid of them.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ll show you some simple ways to do this.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec13"><a id="page_22"></a>
 <strong>UNDOING AND REDOING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can undo your most recent actions by tapping the Undo button at the far end of the blocks palette. If you tap the Undo button multiple times, you will undo more and more of your work, one step at a time.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If you’ve undone several steps, the Redo button will reverse the most recent Undo.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec14">
<strong>DELETING OBJECTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To delete something from ScratchJr, press it with your finger and hold it for a few seconds (sometimes called a <em>long press</em>
 ) until you see a red X appear on the object. Tap the X to delete the object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use this process to delete a character within a project or even delete an entire project from the home screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec15">
<strong>DELETING BLOCKS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To get rid of a block or even a whole script from the programming area, just drag it back up to the blocks palette and let go. You can have any color palette showing to do this; the palette doesn’t have to be the same color as the blocks you are deleting.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec12"><a id="page_23"></a>
 <strong>A GUIDED TOUR OF THE SCRATCHJR INTERFACE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have a good grasp of the basics, you can take a look at all the buttons and features. Try a few of the ones we skipped earlier. If you feel overwhelmed, don’t worry: the rest of the book’s projects will show you how to use everything! It’s okay to skip ahead and refer back here when you need to.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s start with the buttons at the top of the editor.</p>

<strong>STEP 3: MAKE THE CAT MOVE!</strong>

<p class="noindent">This is where the magic happens! You can make amazing animations, silly stories, and great games—all from the ScratchJr editor. Whatever you make will play in the center of the screen. We call this area the <em>stage</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_11"></a>
 Each new project starts with the ScratchJr cat. To make the cat move, we can use the <em>motion blocks</em>
 , which are in the blue <em>palette</em>
 of programming blocks. Use your finger to drag one of the blue arrow blocks to the <em>programming area</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Tap the blue block, and the cat moves in the direction of the arrow!</p>
<p class="indent">You can drag more blocks to the programming area and snap them together to make a sequence of actions, which we call a <em>script</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Add some more blue motion blocks to make the cat dance. Can you guess what movement each block makes? Experiment to see which blocks make the best dance.</p>
<p class="indent">To run the script and see the cat dance, tap any of the blocks in the script. Notice that the script runs from the beginning no matter which block you tap, and each block is highlighted as it runs.</p>
<p class="indent">Congratulations! You just made your first computer program! Now let’s turn it into a dance party!</p>

<p class="indent">The new character will always appear in the middle of the stage. To move the character, use your finger to drag it wherever you want on the stage. We’ve dragged each of our characters to a spotlight.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_16"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You might notice that the script you wrote for the cat disappeared after you selected a new character. Don’t worry: the script is still there! It’s in the cat’s programming area, and now the screen is showing the programming area for the penguin. Each character has its own scripts, like actors in a play. To see the cat’s script, tap the cat in the character area on the left, and you’ll see that your script is still there. Then select the penguin again so that you can give it dance moves of its own.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec07">
<strong>STEP 7: DON’T JUST DANCE, SAY SOMETHING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make the penguin say something before it dances. You can add speech bubbles for characters using the purple Say block. Tap the purple button in the block categories area to reveal the <em>looks blocks</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_17"></a>
 Drag the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Let’s change the text of the Say block from “hi” to “Let’s dance!” First, tap the word <em>hi</em>
 to make the keyboard appear. Use the backspace key to delete <em>hi</em>
 , and then type <strong>Let’s dance!</strong>
 or whatever you want the penguin to say.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_18"></a>
 Add some blue motion blocks to make the penguin dance, and then put a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block at the beginning of the penguin’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now try it out by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll see that the scripts for the cat and the penguin start running at the same time. When you tap the Green Flag button, it will run every script that begins with a Start on Green Flag block for every character, all at the same time. This will be really useful as you make bigger projects with more characters.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec08">
<strong>STEP 8: ADD A TITLE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can display a title on the stage by tapping the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen. In the window that pops up, type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can drag the title around the screen and place it anywhere you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 () and <strong>Change Color</strong>
 () buttons to change the size and color of the title you give your project. Play around and see what suits your stage best. Press <strong>Go</strong>
 to try it out on the stage. If you want to edit the title again, you can tap on the words to bring the text window back up.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_19"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec09">
<strong>STEP 9: NAME YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now give your project a name so that when you open ScratchJr again and see your projects on the home screen, you’ll know which project is which.</p>
<p class="indent">To name your project, tap the yellow tab in the top-right corner of the screen. Then delete the current project name (<em>Project 1</em>
 ) and type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 . When you’re ready to return to the main screen, tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<div class="image"><a id="page_20"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">If you want to send your project to someone else who has ScratchJr, you can do that from this screen too. For more details on how to share your projects, see the Frequently Asked Questions on the ScratchJr website (<em>
<a href="http://www.scratchjr.org/about.html#faq">http://www.scratchjr.org/about.html#faq</a>
</em>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You’re almost finished, but you have one important step left!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec10">
<strong>STEP 10: SAVE YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To save your project and go back to the home screen, tap the <strong>Home</strong>
 button () in the top-left corner. Your project will not be saved until you return to the home screen, so it’s a good idea to do this a few times while you are working on your project so that you don’t lose anything.</p>
<p class="indent">To continue working on your project, just tap the small image of the project on the home screen. This will take you back to the ScratchJr editor for that project.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec11"><a id="page_21"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The ScratchJr characters are all either facing forward or facing right when you first add them to your stage. If you want a character to face to the left, drag a Move Left block to the programming area and tap the block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The character will turn to the left and take a step. You can then delete this block and the character will continue to face left.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec12">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr makes different sounds when you perform different actions on the interface. These sounds can be very useful when you first start using ScratchJr. For example, when you have successfully snapped blocks together in a script, you’ll hear a “pop.” If you want to turn the sounds off, however, you can just turn the volume off on your device.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec11">
<strong>DON’T BE AFRAID TO EXPLORE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you explore the various features of ScratchJr, you should feel free to experiment, try new features, and test out new blocks. You can make your project whatever you want it to be in many ways: you could move your party to the beach, put a boat in the background, add more characters, or do almost anything else you want to do. A good feature of ScratchJr is that if you decide you don’t like any of the changes you’ve made, you can easily get rid of them.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ll show you some simple ways to do this.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec13"><a id="page_22"></a>
 <strong>UNDOING AND REDOING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can undo your most recent actions by tapping the Undo button at the far end of the blocks palette. If you tap the Undo button multiple times, you will undo more and more of your work, one step at a time.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If you’ve undone several steps, the Redo button will reverse the most recent Undo.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec14">
<strong>DELETING OBJECTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To delete something from ScratchJr, press it with your finger and hold it for a few seconds (sometimes called a <em>long press</em>
 ) until you see a red X appear on the object. Tap the X to delete the object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use this process to delete a character within a project or even delete an entire project from the home screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec15">
<strong>DELETING BLOCKS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To get rid of a block or even a whole script from the programming area, just drag it back up to the blocks palette and let go. You can have any color palette showing to do this; the palette doesn’t have to be the same color as the blocks you are deleting.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec12"><a id="page_23"></a>
 <strong>A GUIDED TOUR OF THE SCRATCHJR INTERFACE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have a good grasp of the basics, you can take a look at all the buttons and features. Try a few of the ones we skipped earlier. If you feel overwhelmed, don’t worry: the rest of the book’s projects will show you how to use everything! It’s okay to skip ahead and refer back here when you need to.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s start with the buttons at the top of the editor.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec02">
<strong>STEP 2: MAKE A NEW PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The home screen shows all of your saved ScratchJr projects. In the following picture, you can see two projects that have already been created. If this is your first project, you’ll see only the plus sign. Tap the plus sign to make a new project.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_10"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec03">
<strong>STEP 3: MAKE THE CAT MOVE!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This is where the magic happens! You can make amazing animations, silly stories, and great games—all from the ScratchJr editor. Whatever you make will play in the center of the screen. We call this area the <em>stage</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_11"></a>
 Each new project starts with the ScratchJr cat. To make the cat move, we can use the <em>motion blocks</em>
 , which are in the blue <em>palette</em>
 of programming blocks. Use your finger to drag one of the blue arrow blocks to the <em>programming area</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Tap the blue block, and the cat moves in the direction of the arrow!</p>
<p class="indent">You can drag more blocks to the programming area and snap them together to make a sequence of actions, which we call a <em>script</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Add some more blue motion blocks to make the cat dance. Can you guess what movement each block makes? Experiment to see which blocks make the best dance.</p>
<p class="indent">To run the script and see the cat dance, tap any of the blocks in the script. Notice that the script runs from the beginning no matter which block you tap, and each block is highlighted as it runs.</p>
<p class="indent">Congratulations! You just made your first computer program! Now let’s turn it into a dance party!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec04"><a id="page_12"></a>
 <strong>STEP 4: USE THE GREEN FLAG</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are other ways to make your project run besides tapping on scripts. You can also use the Start on Green Flag block to start your script.</p>
<p class="indent">First, tap the yellow button in the <em>block categories area</em>
 to show the <em>triggering blocks</em>
 . Select the <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, drag it to the programming area, and snap it onto the front of your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The cat will dance just like it did when you tapped on the script!</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that there are other triggering blocks. You’ll find out how to use these as you go through the other projects in this book.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec05"><a id="page_13"></a>
 <strong>STEP 5: ADD A BACKGROUND</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s get the cat to dance on a stage, instead of just a plain white background. Select a new background by tapping on the button with the blue sky and green grass at the top of the main screen. This is called the <em>Change Background button</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll see loads of backgrounds that you can choose from. For our dancing cat, let’s choose the theatre. Tap the check mark at the top to load it into your stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Congratulations! Your cat is a star!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_14"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">The cat is smiling and dancing, but it looks a bit lonely dancing on its own. . . .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec06">
<strong>STEP 6: ADD ANOTHER CHARACTER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s give your cat a friend. Tap the plus sign on the left side of your screen to add a character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_15"></a>
 If you scroll down the page, you’ll see the many characters you can choose from. Tap the character you want to add, and then tap the check mark to add it to your project. We’ve chosen the penguin.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec09">
<strong>STEP 9: NAME YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now give your project a name so that when you open ScratchJr again and see your projects on the home screen, you’ll know which project is which.</p>
<p class="indent">To name your project, tap the yellow tab in the top-right corner of the screen. Then delete the current project name (<em>Project 1</em>
 ) and type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 . When you’re ready to return to the main screen, tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<div class="image"><a id="page_20"></a>

 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You’re almost finished, but you have one important step left!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec10">
<strong>STEP 10: SAVE YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To save your project and go back to the home screen, tap the <strong>Home</strong>
 button () in the top-left corner. Your project will not be saved until you return to the home screen, so it’s a good idea to do this a few times while you are working on your project so that you don’t lose anything.</p>
<p class="indent">To continue working on your project, just tap the small image of the project on the home screen. This will take you back to the ScratchJr editor for that project.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec11"><a id="page_21"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The ScratchJr characters are all either facing forward or facing right when you first add them to your stage. If you want a character to face to the left, drag a Move Left block to the programming area and tap the block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The character will turn to the left and take a step. You can then delete this block and the character will continue to face left.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec12">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr makes different sounds when you perform different actions on the interface. These sounds can be very useful when you first start using ScratchJr. For example, when you have successfully snapped blocks together in a script, you’ll hear a “pop.” If you want to turn the sounds off, however, you can just turn the volume off on your device.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec11">
<strong>DON’T BE AFRAID TO EXPLORE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you explore the various features of ScratchJr, you should feel free to experiment, try new features, and test out new blocks. You can make your project whatever you want it to be in many ways: you could move your party to the beach, put a boat in the background, add more characters, or do almost anything else you want to do. A good feature of ScratchJr is that if you decide you don’t like any of the changes you’ve made, you can easily get rid of them.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ll show you some simple ways to do this.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec13"><a id="page_22"></a>
 <strong>UNDOING AND REDOING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can undo your most recent actions by tapping the Undo button at the far end of the blocks palette. If you tap the Undo button multiple times, you will undo more and more of your work, one step at a time.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If you’ve undone several steps, the Redo button will reverse the most recent Undo.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec14">
<strong>DELETING OBJECTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To delete something from ScratchJr, press it with your finger and hold it for a few seconds (sometimes called a <em>long press</em>
 ) until you see a red X appear on the object. Tap the X to delete the object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use this process to delete a character within a project or even delete an entire project from the home screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec15">
<strong>DELETING BLOCKS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To get rid of a block or even a whole script from the programming area, just drag it back up to the blocks palette and let go. You can have any color palette showing to do this; the palette doesn’t have to be the same color as the blocks you are deleting.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec12"><a id="page_23"></a>
 <strong>A GUIDED TOUR OF THE SCRATCHJR INTERFACE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have a good grasp of the basics, you can take a look at all the buttons and features. Try a few of the ones we skipped earlier. If you feel overwhelmed, don’t worry: the rest of the book’s projects will show you how to use everything! It’s okay to skip ahead and refer back here when you need to.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s start with the buttons at the top of the editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<div class="image"><a id="page_24"></a>

<div class="image"><a id="page_10"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec03">
<strong>STEP 3: MAKE THE CAT MOVE!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">This is where the magic happens! You can make amazing animations, silly stories, and great games—all from the ScratchJr editor. Whatever you make will play in the center of the screen. We call this area the <em>stage</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_11"></a>
 Each new project starts with the ScratchJr cat. To make the cat move, we can use the <em>motion blocks</em>
 , which are in the blue <em>palette</em>
 of programming blocks. Use your finger to drag one of the blue arrow blocks to the <em>programming area</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Tap the blue block, and the cat moves in the direction of the arrow!</p>
<p class="indent">You can drag more blocks to the programming area and snap them together to make a sequence of actions, which we call a <em>script</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Add some more blue motion blocks to make the cat dance. Can you guess what movement each block makes? Experiment to see which blocks make the best dance.</p>
<p class="indent">To run the script and see the cat dance, tap any of the blocks in the script. Notice that the script runs from the beginning no matter which block you tap, and each block is highlighted as it runs.</p>
<p class="indent">Congratulations! You just made your first computer program! Now let’s turn it into a dance party!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec04"><a id="page_12"></a>
 <strong>STEP 4: USE THE GREEN FLAG</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are other ways to make your project run besides tapping on scripts. You can also use the Start on Green Flag block to start your script.</p>
<p class="indent">First, tap the yellow button in the <em>block categories area</em>
 to show the <em>triggering blocks</em>
 . Select the <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, drag it to the programming area, and snap it onto the front of your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The cat will dance just like it did when you tapped on the script!</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that there are other triggering blocks. You’ll find out how to use these as you go through the other projects in this book.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec05"><a id="page_13"></a>
 <strong>STEP 5: ADD A BACKGROUND</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s get the cat to dance on a stage, instead of just a plain white background. Select a new background by tapping on the button with the blue sky and green grass at the top of the main screen. This is called the <em>Change Background button</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll see loads of backgrounds that you can choose from. For our dancing cat, let’s choose the theatre. Tap the check mark at the top to load it into your stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Congratulations! Your cat is a star!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_14"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">The cat is smiling and dancing, but it looks a bit lonely dancing on its own. . . .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec06">
<strong>STEP 6: ADD ANOTHER CHARACTER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s give your cat a friend. Tap the plus sign on the left side of your screen to add a character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_15"></a>
 If you scroll down the page, you’ll see the many characters you can choose from. Tap the character you want to add, and then tap the check mark to add it to your project. We’ve chosen the penguin.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now there are two characters on the stage. To the left of the stage is the <em>character area</em>
 , which shows you all the characters involved in your project.</p>
<p class="indent">The new character will always appear in the middle of the stage. To move the character, use your finger to drag it wherever you want on the stage. We’ve dragged each of our characters to a spotlight.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_16"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You might notice that the script you wrote for the cat disappeared after you selected a new character. Don’t worry: the script is still there! It’s in the cat’s programming area, and now the screen is showing the programming area for the penguin. Each character has its own scripts, like actors in a play. To see the cat’s script, tap the cat in the character area on the left, and you’ll see that your script is still there. Then select the penguin again so that you can give it dance moves of its own.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec07">
<strong>STEP 7: DON’T JUST DANCE, SAY SOMETHING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make the penguin say something before it dances. You can add speech bubbles for characters using the purple Say block. Tap the purple button in the block categories area to reveal the <em>looks blocks</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_17"></a>
 Drag the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Let’s change the text of the Say block from “hi” to “Let’s dance!” First, tap the word <em>hi</em>
 to make the keyboard appear. Use the backspace key to delete <em>hi</em>
 , and then type <strong>Let’s dance!</strong>
 or whatever you want the penguin to say.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_18"></a>
 Add some blue motion blocks to make the penguin dance, and then put a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block at the beginning of the penguin’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now try it out by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll see that the scripts for the cat and the penguin start running at the same time. When you tap the Green Flag button, it will run every script that begins with a Start on Green Flag block for every character, all at the same time. This will be really useful as you make bigger projects with more characters.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec08">
<strong>STEP 8: ADD A TITLE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can display a title on the stage by tapping the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen. In the window that pops up, type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can drag the title around the screen and place it anywhere you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 () and <strong>Change Color</strong>
 () buttons to change the size and color of the title you give your project. Play around and see what suits your stage best. Press <strong>Go</strong>
 to try it out on the stage. If you want to edit the title again, you can tap on the words to bring the text window back up.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_19"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec09">
<strong>STEP 9: NAME YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now give your project a name so that when you open ScratchJr again and see your projects on the home screen, you’ll know which project is which.</p>
<p class="indent">To name your project, tap the yellow tab in the top-right corner of the screen. Then delete the current project name (<em>Project 1</em>
 ) and type <strong>Dance Party</strong>

<p class="noindent">You can undo your most recent actions by tapping the Undo button at the far end of the blocks palette. If you tap the Undo button multiple times, you will undo more and more of your work, one step at a time.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If you’ve undone several steps, the Redo button will reverse the most recent Undo.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec14">
<strong>DELETING OBJECTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To delete something from ScratchJr, press it with your finger and hold it for a few seconds (sometimes called a <em>long press</em>
 ) until you see a red X appear on the object. Tap the X to delete the object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use this process to delete a character within a project or even delete an entire project from the home screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec15">
<strong>DELETING BLOCKS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To get rid of a block or even a whole script from the programming area, just drag it back up to the blocks palette and let go. You can have any color palette showing to do this; the palette doesn’t have to be the same color as the blocks you are deleting.</p>

 <strong>A GUIDED TOUR OF THE SCRATCHJR INTERFACE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have a good grasp of the basics, you can take a look at all the buttons and features. Try a few of the ones we skipped earlier. If you feel overwhelmed, don’t worry: the rest of the book’s projects will show you how to use everything! It’s okay to skip ahead and refer back here when you need to.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s start with the buttons at the top of the editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<div class="image"><a id="page_24"></a>
</div>
<div class="image"><a id="page_25"></a>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec13">
<strong>WHAT’S NEXT?</strong>
</h3>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">This is where the magic happens! You can make amazing animations, silly stories, and great games—all from the ScratchJr editor. Whatever you make will play in the center of the screen. We call this area the <em>stage</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_11"></a>
 Each new project starts with the ScratchJr cat. To make the cat move, we can use the <em>motion blocks</em>
 , which are in the blue <em>palette</em>
 of programming blocks. Use your finger to drag one of the blue arrow blocks to the <em>programming area</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Tap the blue block, and the cat moves in the direction of the arrow!</p>
<p class="indent">You can drag more blocks to the programming area and snap them together to make a sequence of actions, which we call a <em>script</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Add some more blue motion blocks to make the cat dance. Can you guess what movement each block makes? Experiment to see which blocks make the best dance.</p>
<p class="indent">To run the script and see the cat dance, tap any of the blocks in the script. Notice that the script runs from the beginning no matter which block you tap, and each block is highlighted as it runs.</p>
<p class="indent">Congratulations! You just made your first computer program! Now let’s turn it into a dance party!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec04"><a id="page_12"></a>
 <strong>STEP 4: USE THE GREEN FLAG</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are other ways to make your project run besides tapping on scripts. You can also use the Start on Green Flag block to start your script.</p>
<p class="indent">First, tap the yellow button in the <em>block categories area</em>
 to show the <em>triggering blocks</em>
 . Select the <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, drag it to the programming area, and snap it onto the front of your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The cat will dance just like it did when you tapped on the script!</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that there are other triggering blocks. You’ll find out how to use these as you go through the other projects in this book.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec05"><a id="page_13"></a>
 <strong>STEP 5: ADD A BACKGROUND</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s get the cat to dance on a stage, instead of just a plain white background. Select a new background by tapping on the button with the blue sky and green grass at the top of the main screen. This is called the <em>Change Background button</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll see loads of backgrounds that you can choose from. For our dancing cat, let’s choose the theatre. Tap the check mark at the top to load it into your stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Congratulations! Your cat is a star!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_14"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">The cat is smiling and dancing, but it looks a bit lonely dancing on its own. . . .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec06">
<strong>STEP 6: ADD ANOTHER CHARACTER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s give your cat a friend. Tap the plus sign on the left side of your screen to add a character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_15"></a>
 If you scroll down the page, you’ll see the many characters you can choose from. Tap the character you want to add, and then tap the check mark to add it to your project. We’ve chosen the penguin.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now there are two characters on the stage. To the left of the stage is the <em>character area</em>
 , which shows you all the characters involved in your project.</p>
<p class="indent">The new character will always appear in the middle of the stage. To move the character, use your finger to drag it wherever you want on the stage. We’ve dragged each of our characters to a spotlight.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_16"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You might notice that the script you wrote for the cat disappeared after you selected a new character. Don’t worry: the script is still there! It’s in the cat’s programming area, and now the screen is showing the programming area for the penguin. Each character has its own scripts, like actors in a play. To see the cat’s script, tap the cat in the character area on the left, and you’ll see that your script is still there. Then select the penguin again so that you can give it dance moves of its own.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec07">
<strong>STEP 7: DON’T JUST DANCE, SAY SOMETHING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make the penguin say something before it dances. You can add speech bubbles for characters using the purple Say block. Tap the purple button in the block categories area to reveal the <em>looks blocks</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_17"></a>
 Drag the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Let’s change the text of the Say block from “hi” to “Let’s dance!” First, tap the word <em>hi</em>
 to make the keyboard appear. Use the backspace key to delete <em>hi</em>
 , and then type <strong>Let’s dance!</strong>
 or whatever you want the penguin to say.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_18"></a>
 Add some blue motion blocks to make the penguin dance, and then put a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block at the beginning of the penguin’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now try it out by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll see that the scripts for the cat and the penguin start running at the same time. When you tap the Green Flag button, it will run every script that begins with a Start on Green Flag block for every character, all at the same time. This will be really useful as you make bigger projects with more characters.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec08">
<strong>STEP 8: ADD A TITLE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can display a title on the stage by tapping the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen. In the window that pops up, type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can drag the title around the screen and place it anywhere you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 () and <strong>Change Color</strong>
 () buttons to change the size and color of the title you give your project. Play around and see what suits your stage best. Press <strong>Go</strong>
 to try it out on the stage. If you want to edit the title again, you can tap on the words to bring the text window back up.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_19"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec09">
<strong>STEP 9: NAME YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now give your project a name so that when you open ScratchJr again and see your projects on the home screen, you’ll know which project is which.</p>
<p class="indent">To name your project, tap the yellow tab in the top-right corner of the screen. Then delete the current project name (<em>Project 1</em>
 ) and type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 . When you’re ready to return to the main screen, tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<div class="image"><a id="page_20"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">If you want to send your project to someone else who has ScratchJr, you can do that from this screen too. For more details on how to share your projects, see the Frequently Asked Questions on the ScratchJr website (<em>
<a href="http://www.scratchjr.org/about.html#faq">http://www.scratchjr.org/about.html#faq</a>
</em>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You’re almost finished, but you have one important step left!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec10">
<strong>STEP 10: SAVE YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To save your project and go back to the home screen, tap the <strong>Home</strong>
 button () in the top-left corner. Your project will not be saved until you return to the home screen, so it’s a good idea to do this a few times while you are working on your project so that you don’t lose anything.</p>
<p class="indent">To continue working on your project, just tap the small image of the project on the home screen. This will take you back to the ScratchJr editor for that project.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec11"><a id="page_21"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The ScratchJr characters are all either facing forward or facing right when you first add them to your stage. If you want a character to face to the left, drag a Move Left block to the programming area and tap the block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The character will turn to the left and take a step. You can then delete this block and the character will continue to face left.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec12">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr makes different sounds when you perform different actions on the interface. These sounds can be very useful when you first start using ScratchJr. For example, when you have successfully snapped blocks together in a script, you’ll hear a “pop.” If you want to turn the sounds off, however, you can just turn the volume off on your device.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec11">
<strong>DON’T BE AFRAID TO EXPLORE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you explore the various features of ScratchJr, you should feel free to experiment, try new features, and test out new blocks. You can make your project whatever you want it to be in many ways: you could move your party to the beach, put a boat in the background, add more characters, or do almost anything else you want to do. A good feature of ScratchJr is that if you decide you don’t like any of the changes you’ve made, you can easily get rid of them.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ll show you some simple ways to do this.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec13"><a id="page_22"></a>
 <strong>UNDOING AND REDOING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can undo your most recent actions by tapping the Undo button at the far end of the blocks palette. If you tap the Undo button multiple times, you will undo more and more of your work, one step at a time.</p>

<p class="indent">You’ll see loads of backgrounds that you can choose from. For our dancing cat, let’s choose the theatre. Tap the check mark at the top to load it into your stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Congratulations! Your cat is a star!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_14"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">The cat is smiling and dancing, but it looks a bit lonely dancing on its own. . . .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec06">
<strong>STEP 6: ADD ANOTHER CHARACTER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s give your cat a friend. Tap the plus sign on the left side of your screen to add a character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_15"></a>
 If you scroll down the page, you’ll see the many characters you can choose from. Tap the character you want to add, and then tap the check mark to add it to your project. We’ve chosen the penguin.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now there are two characters on the stage. To the left of the stage is the <em>character area</em>
 , which shows you all the characters involved in your project.</p>
<p class="indent">The new character will always appear in the middle of the stage. To move the character, use your finger to drag it wherever you want on the stage. We’ve dragged each of our characters to a spotlight.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_16"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You might notice that the script you wrote for the cat disappeared after you selected a new character. Don’t worry: the script is still there! It’s in the cat’s programming area, and now the screen is showing the programming area for the penguin. Each character has its own scripts, like actors in a play. To see the cat’s script, tap the cat in the character area on the left, and you’ll see that your script is still there. Then select the penguin again so that you can give it dance moves of its own.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec07">
<strong>STEP 7: DON’T JUST DANCE, SAY SOMETHING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make the penguin say something before it dances. You can add speech bubbles for characters using the purple Say block. Tap the purple button in the block categories area to reveal the <em>looks blocks</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_17"></a>
 Drag the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Let’s change the text of the Say block from “hi” to “Let’s dance!” First, tap the word <em>hi</em>
 to make the keyboard appear. Use the backspace key to delete <em>hi</em>
 , and then type <strong>Let’s dance!</strong>
 or whatever you want the penguin to say.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_18"></a>
 Add some blue motion blocks to make the penguin dance, and then put a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block at the beginning of the penguin’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now try it out by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll see that the scripts for the cat and the penguin start running at the same time. When you tap the Green Flag button, it will run every script that begins with a Start on Green Flag block for every character, all at the same time. This will be really useful as you make bigger projects with more characters.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec08">
<strong>STEP 8: ADD A TITLE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can display a title on the stage by tapping the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen. In the window that pops up, type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can drag the title around the screen and place it anywhere you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 () and <strong>Change Color</strong>
 () buttons to change the size and color of the title you give your project. Play around and see what suits your stage best. Press <strong>Go</strong>
 to try it out on the stage. If you want to edit the title again, you can tap on the words to bring the text window back up.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_19"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec09">
<strong>STEP 9: NAME YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now give your project a name so that when you open ScratchJr again and see your projects on the home screen, you’ll know which project is which.</p>
<p class="indent">To name your project, tap the yellow tab in the top-right corner of the screen. Then delete the current project name (<em>Project 1</em>
 ) and type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 . When you’re ready to return to the main screen, tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<div class="image"><a id="page_20"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">If you want to send your project to someone else who has ScratchJr, you can do that from this screen too. For more details on how to share your projects, see the Frequently Asked Questions on the ScratchJr website (<em>
<a href="http://www.scratchjr.org/about.html#faq">http://www.scratchjr.org/about.html#faq</a>
</em>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You’re almost finished, but you have one important step left!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec10">
<strong>STEP 10: SAVE YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To save your project and go back to the home screen, tap the <strong>Home</strong>
 button () in the top-left corner. Your project will not be saved until you return to the home screen, so it’s a good idea to do this a few times while you are working on your project so that you don’t lose anything.</p>
<p class="indent">To continue working on your project, just tap the small image of the project on the home screen. This will take you back to the ScratchJr editor for that project.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec11"><a id="page_21"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The ScratchJr characters are all either facing forward or facing right when you first add them to your stage. If you want a character to face to the left, drag a Move Left block to the programming area and tap the block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The character will turn to the left and take a step. You can then delete this block and the character will continue to face left.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec12">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr makes different sounds when you perform different actions on the interface. These sounds can be very useful when you first start using ScratchJr. For example, when you have successfully snapped blocks together in a script, you’ll hear a “pop.” If you want to turn the sounds off, however, you can just turn the volume off on your device.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec11">
<strong>DON’T BE AFRAID TO EXPLORE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you explore the various features of ScratchJr, you should feel free to experiment, try new features, and test out new blocks. You can make your project whatever you want it to be in many ways: you could move your party to the beach, put a boat in the background, add more characters, or do almost anything else you want to do. A good feature of ScratchJr is that if you decide you don’t like any of the changes you’ve made, you can easily get rid of them.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ll show you some simple ways to do this.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec13"><a id="page_22"></a>
 <strong>UNDOING AND REDOING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can undo your most recent actions by tapping the Undo button at the far end of the blocks palette. If you tap the Undo button multiple times, you will undo more and more of your work, one step at a time.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If you’ve undone several steps, the Redo button will reverse the most recent Undo.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec14">
<strong>DELETING OBJECTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To delete something from ScratchJr, press it with your finger and hold it for a few seconds (sometimes called a <em>long press</em>
 ) until you see a red X appear on the object. Tap the X to delete the object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use this process to delete a character within a project or even delete an entire project from the home screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec15">
<strong>DELETING BLOCKS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To get rid of a block or even a whole script from the programming area, just drag it back up to the blocks palette and let go. You can have any color palette showing to do this; the palette doesn’t have to be the same color as the blocks you are deleting.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec12"><a id="page_23"></a>
 <strong>A GUIDED TOUR OF THE SCRATCHJR INTERFACE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have a good grasp of the basics, you can take a look at all the buttons and features. Try a few of the ones we skipped earlier. If you feel overwhelmed, don’t worry: the rest of the book’s projects will show you how to use everything! It’s okay to skip ahead and refer back here when you need to.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s start with the buttons at the top of the editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>

<strong>WHAT’S NEXT?</strong>
</h3>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">You can drag more blocks to the programming area and snap them together to make a sequence of actions, which we call a <em>script</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Add some more blue motion blocks to make the cat dance. Can you guess what movement each block makes? Experiment to see which blocks make the best dance.</p>
<p class="indent">To run the script and see the cat dance, tap any of the blocks in the script. Notice that the script runs from the beginning no matter which block you tap, and each block is highlighted as it runs.</p>
<p class="indent">Congratulations! You just made your first computer program! Now let’s turn it into a dance party!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec04"><a id="page_12"></a>
 <strong>STEP 4: USE THE GREEN FLAG</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are other ways to make your project run besides tapping on scripts. You can also use the Start on Green Flag block to start your script.</p>
<p class="indent">First, tap the yellow button in the <em>block categories area</em>
 to show the <em>triggering blocks</em>
 . Select the <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, drag it to the programming area, and snap it onto the front of your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The cat will dance just like it did when you tapped on the script!</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that there are other triggering blocks. You’ll find out how to use these as you go through the other projects in this book.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec05"><a id="page_13"></a>
 <strong>STEP 5: ADD A BACKGROUND</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s get the cat to dance on a stage, instead of just a plain white background. Select a new background by tapping on the button with the blue sky and green grass at the top of the main screen. This is called the <em>Change Background button</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll see loads of backgrounds that you can choose from. For our dancing cat, let’s choose the theatre. Tap the check mark at the top to load it into your stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Congratulations! Your cat is a star!</p>

<p class="noindent">As you explore the various features of ScratchJr, you should feel free to experiment, try new features, and test out new blocks. You can make your project whatever you want it to be in many ways: you could move your party to the beach, put a boat in the background, add more characters, or do almost anything else you want to do. A good feature of ScratchJr is that if you decide you don’t like any of the changes you’ve made, you can easily get rid of them.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec12"><a id="page_23"></a>
 <strong>A GUIDED TOUR OF THE SCRATCHJR INTERFACE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have a good grasp of the basics, you can take a look at all the buttons and features. Try a few of the ones we skipped earlier. If you feel overwhelmed, don’t worry: the rest of the book’s projects will show you how to use everything! It’s okay to skip ahead and refer back here when you need to.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s start with the buttons at the top of the editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<div class="image"><a id="page_24"></a>

<div class="image"><a id="page_25"></a>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec13">
<strong>WHAT’S NEXT?</strong>
</h3>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">To run the script and see the cat dance, tap any of the blocks in the script. Notice that the script runs from the beginning no matter which block you tap, and each block is highlighted as it runs.</p>
<p class="indent">Congratulations! You just made your first computer program! Now let’s turn it into a dance party!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec04"><a id="page_12"></a>
 <strong>STEP 4: USE THE GREEN FLAG</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are other ways to make your project run besides tapping on scripts. You can also use the Start on Green Flag block to start your script.</p>
<p class="indent">First, tap the yellow button in the <em>block categories area</em>
 to show the <em>triggering blocks</em>
 . Select the <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block, drag it to the programming area, and snap it onto the front of your script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The cat will dance just like it did when you tapped on the script!</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that there are other triggering blocks. You’ll find out how to use these as you go through the other projects in this book.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec05"><a id="page_13"></a>
 <strong>STEP 5: ADD A BACKGROUND</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s get the cat to dance on a stage, instead of just a plain white background. Select a new background by tapping on the button with the blue sky and green grass at the top of the main screen. This is called the <em>Change Background button</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll see loads of backgrounds that you can choose from. For our dancing cat, let’s choose the theatre. Tap the check mark at the top to load it into your stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Congratulations! Your cat is a star!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_14"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">The cat is smiling and dancing, but it looks a bit lonely dancing on its own. . . .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec06">
<strong>STEP 6: ADD ANOTHER CHARACTER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s give your cat a friend. Tap the plus sign on the left side of your screen to add a character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_15"></a>
 If you scroll down the page, you’ll see the many characters you can choose from. Tap the character you want to add, and then tap the check mark to add it to your project. We’ve chosen the penguin.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now there are two characters on the stage. To the left of the stage is the <em>character area</em>
 , which shows you all the characters involved in your project.</p>
<p class="indent">The new character will always appear in the middle of the stage. To move the character, use your finger to drag it wherever you want on the stage. We’ve dragged each of our characters to a spotlight.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_16"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You might notice that the script you wrote for the cat disappeared after you selected a new character. Don’t worry: the script is still there! It’s in the cat’s programming area, and now the screen is showing the programming area for the penguin. Each character has its own scripts, like actors in a play. To see the cat’s script, tap the cat in the character area on the left, and you’ll see that your script is still there. Then select the penguin again so that you can give it dance moves of its own.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec07">
<strong>STEP 7: DON’T JUST DANCE, SAY SOMETHING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make the penguin say something before it dances. You can add speech bubbles for characters using the purple Say block. Tap the purple button in the block categories area to reveal the <em>looks blocks</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_17"></a>
 Drag the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Let’s change the text of the Say block from “hi” to “Let’s dance!” First, tap the word <em>hi</em>
 to make the keyboard appear. Use the backspace key to delete <em>hi</em>
 , and then type <strong>Let’s dance!</strong>
 or whatever you want the penguin to say.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_18"></a>
 Add some blue motion blocks to make the penguin dance, and then put a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block at the beginning of the penguin’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now try it out by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll see that the scripts for the cat and the penguin start running at the same time. When you tap the Green Flag button, it will run every script that begins with a Start on Green Flag block for every character, all at the same time. This will be really useful as you make bigger projects with more characters.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec08">
<strong>STEP 8: ADD A TITLE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can display a title on the stage by tapping the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen. In the window that pops up, type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can drag the title around the screen and place it anywhere you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 () and <strong>Change Color</strong>
 () buttons to change the size and color of the title you give your project. Play around and see what suits your stage best. Press <strong>Go</strong>
 to try it out on the stage. If you want to edit the title again, you can tap on the words to bring the text window back up.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_19"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec09">
<strong>STEP 9: NAME YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now give your project a name so that when you open ScratchJr again and see your projects on the home screen, you’ll know which project is which.</p>
<p class="indent">To name your project, tap the yellow tab in the top-right corner of the screen. Then delete the current project name (<em>Project 1</em>
 ) and type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 . When you’re ready to return to the main screen, tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<div class="image"><a id="page_20"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">If you want to send your project to someone else who has ScratchJr, you can do that from this screen too. For more details on how to share your projects, see the Frequently Asked Questions on the ScratchJr website (<em>

<p class="indent">You’re almost finished, but you have one important step left!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec10">
<strong>STEP 10: SAVE YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To save your project and go back to the home screen, tap the <strong>Home</strong>
 button () in the top-left corner. Your project will not be saved until you return to the home screen, so it’s a good idea to do this a few times while you are working on your project so that you don’t lose anything.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec12">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr makes different sounds when you perform different actions on the interface. These sounds can be very useful when you first start using ScratchJr. For example, when you have successfully snapped blocks together in a script, you’ll hear a “pop.” If you want to turn the sounds off, however, you can just turn the volume off on your device.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec11">

<p class="indent"><a id="page_15"></a>
 If you scroll down the page, you’ll see the many characters you can choose from. Tap the character you want to add, and then tap the check mark to add it to your project. We’ve chosen the penguin.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now there are two characters on the stage. To the left of the stage is the <em>character area</em>
 , which shows you all the characters involved in your project.</p>
<p class="indent">The new character will always appear in the middle of the stage. To move the character, use your finger to drag it wherever you want on the stage. We’ve dragged each of our characters to a spotlight.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_16"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You might notice that the script you wrote for the cat disappeared after you selected a new character. Don’t worry: the script is still there! It’s in the cat’s programming area, and now the screen is showing the programming area for the penguin. Each character has its own scripts, like actors in a play. To see the cat’s script, tap the cat in the character area on the left, and you’ll see that your script is still there. Then select the penguin again so that you can give it dance moves of its own.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec07">
<strong>STEP 7: DON’T JUST DANCE, SAY SOMETHING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make the penguin say something before it dances. You can add speech bubbles for characters using the purple Say block. Tap the purple button in the block categories area to reveal the <em>looks blocks</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_17"></a>
 Drag the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Let’s change the text of the Say block from “hi” to “Let’s dance!” First, tap the word <em>hi</em>
 to make the keyboard appear. Use the backspace key to delete <em>hi</em>
 , and then type <strong>Let’s dance!</strong>
 or whatever you want the penguin to say.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_18"></a>
 Add some blue motion blocks to make the penguin dance, and then put a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block at the beginning of the penguin’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now try it out by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll see that the scripts for the cat and the penguin start running at the same time. When you tap the Green Flag button, it will run every script that begins with a Start on Green Flag block for every character, all at the same time. This will be really useful as you make bigger projects with more characters.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec08">
<strong>STEP 8: ADD A TITLE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can display a title on the stage by tapping the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen. In the window that pops up, type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can drag the title around the screen and place it anywhere you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 () and <strong>Change Color</strong>
 () buttons to change the size and color of the title you give your project. Play around and see what suits your stage best. Press <strong>Go</strong>
 to try it out on the stage. If you want to edit the title again, you can tap on the words to bring the text window back up.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_19"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec09">
<strong>STEP 9: NAME YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now give your project a name so that when you open ScratchJr again and see your projects on the home screen, you’ll know which project is which.</p>
<p class="indent">To name your project, tap the yellow tab in the top-right corner of the screen. Then delete the current project name (<em>Project 1</em>
 ) and type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 . When you’re ready to return to the main screen, tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<div class="image"><a id="page_20"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">If you want to send your project to someone else who has ScratchJr, you can do that from this screen too. For more details on how to share your projects, see the Frequently Asked Questions on the ScratchJr website (<em>
<a href="http://www.scratchjr.org/about.html#faq">http://www.scratchjr.org/about.html#faq</a>

 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You’re almost finished, but you have one important step left!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec10">
<strong>STEP 10: SAVE YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To save your project and go back to the home screen, tap the <strong>Home</strong>
 button () in the top-left corner. Your project will not be saved until you return to the home screen, so it’s a good idea to do this a few times while you are working on your project so that you don’t lose anything.</p>
<p class="indent">To continue working on your project, just tap the small image of the project on the home screen. This will take you back to the ScratchJr editor for that project.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec11"><a id="page_21"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The ScratchJr characters are all either facing forward or facing right when you first add them to your stage. If you want a character to face to the left, drag a Move Left block to the programming area and tap the block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The character will turn to the left and take a step. You can then delete this block and the character will continue to face left.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec12">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr makes different sounds when you perform different actions on the interface. These sounds can be very useful when you first start using ScratchJr. For example, when you have successfully snapped blocks together in a script, you’ll hear a “pop.” If you want to turn the sounds off, however, you can just turn the volume off on your device.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec11">
<strong>DON’T BE AFRAID TO EXPLORE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you explore the various features of ScratchJr, you should feel free to experiment, try new features, and test out new blocks. You can make your project whatever you want it to be in many ways: you could move your party to the beach, put a boat in the background, add more characters, or do almost anything else you want to do. A good feature of ScratchJr is that if you decide you don’t like any of the changes you’ve made, you can easily get rid of them.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ll show you some simple ways to do this.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec13"><a id="page_22"></a>
 <strong>UNDOING AND REDOING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can undo your most recent actions by tapping the Undo button at the far end of the blocks palette. If you tap the Undo button multiple times, you will undo more and more of your work, one step at a time.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If you’ve undone several steps, the Redo button will reverse the most recent Undo.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec14">
<strong>DELETING OBJECTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To delete something from ScratchJr, press it with your finger and hold it for a few seconds (sometimes called a <em>long press</em>
 ) until you see a red X appear on the object. Tap the X to delete the object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use this process to delete a character within a project or even delete an entire project from the home screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec15">
<strong>DELETING BLOCKS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To get rid of a block or even a whole script from the programming area, just drag it back up to the blocks palette and let go. You can have any color palette showing to do this; the palette doesn’t have to be the same color as the blocks you are deleting.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec12"><a id="page_23"></a>
 <strong>A GUIDED TOUR OF THE SCRATCHJR INTERFACE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have a good grasp of the basics, you can take a look at all the buttons and features. Try a few of the ones we skipped earlier. If you feel overwhelmed, don’t worry: the rest of the book’s projects will show you how to use everything! It’s okay to skip ahead and refer back here when you need to.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s start with the buttons at the top of the editor.</p>

<p class="noindent">There are other ways to make your project run besides tapping on scripts. You can also use the Start on Green Flag block to start your script.</p>
<p class="indent">First, tap the yellow button in the <em>block categories area</em>

<p class="indent">Now tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The cat will dance just like it did when you tapped on the script!</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec05"><a id="page_13"></a>
 <strong>STEP 5: ADD A BACKGROUND</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s get the cat to dance on a stage, instead of just a plain white background. Select a new background by tapping on the button with the blue sky and green grass at the top of the main screen. This is called the <em>Change Background button</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll see loads of backgrounds that you can choose from. For our dancing cat, let’s choose the theatre. Tap the check mark at the top to load it into your stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Congratulations! Your cat is a star!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_14"></a>

<p class="indent">If you’ve undone several steps, the Redo button will reverse the most recent Undo.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec14">
<strong>DELETING OBJECTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To delete something from ScratchJr, press it with your finger and hold it for a few seconds (sometimes called a <em>long press</em>
 ) until you see a red X appear on the object. Tap the X to delete the object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use this process to delete a character within a project or even delete an entire project from the home screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec15">
<strong>DELETING BLOCKS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To get rid of a block or even a whole script from the programming area, just drag it back up to the blocks palette and let go. You can have any color palette showing to do this; the palette doesn’t have to be the same color as the blocks you are deleting.</p>

 <strong>A GUIDED TOUR OF THE SCRATCHJR INTERFACE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have a good grasp of the basics, you can take a look at all the buttons and features. Try a few of the ones we skipped earlier. If you feel overwhelmed, don’t worry: the rest of the book’s projects will show you how to use everything! It’s okay to skip ahead and refer back here when you need to.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s start with the buttons at the top of the editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<div class="image"><a id="page_24"></a>

<strong>WHAT’S NEXT?</strong>
</h3>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now tap the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button at the top of the screen.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The cat will dance just like it did when you tapped on the script!</p>
<p class="indent">You can see that there are other triggering blocks. You’ll find out how to use these as you go through the other projects in this book.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec05"><a id="page_13"></a>
 <strong>STEP 5: ADD A BACKGROUND</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s get the cat to dance on a stage, instead of just a plain white background. Select a new background by tapping on the button with the blue sky and green grass at the top of the main screen. This is called the <em>Change Background button</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll see loads of backgrounds that you can choose from. For our dancing cat, let’s choose the theatre. Tap the check mark at the top to load it into your stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Congratulations! Your cat is a star!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_14"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">The cat is smiling and dancing, but it looks a bit lonely dancing on its own. . . .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec06">
<strong>STEP 6: ADD ANOTHER CHARACTER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s give your cat a friend. Tap the plus sign on the left side of your screen to add a character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_15"></a>
 If you scroll down the page, you’ll see the many characters you can choose from. Tap the character you want to add, and then tap the check mark to add it to your project. We’ve chosen the penguin.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now there are two characters on the stage. To the left of the stage is the <em>character area</em>
 , which shows you all the characters involved in your project.</p>
<p class="indent">The new character will always appear in the middle of the stage. To move the character, use your finger to drag it wherever you want on the stage. We’ve dragged each of our characters to a spotlight.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_16"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You might notice that the script you wrote for the cat disappeared after you selected a new character. Don’t worry: the script is still there! It’s in the cat’s programming area, and now the screen is showing the programming area for the penguin. Each character has its own scripts, like actors in a play. To see the cat’s script, tap the cat in the character area on the left, and you’ll see that your script is still there. Then select the penguin again so that you can give it dance moves of its own.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec07">
<strong>STEP 7: DON’T JUST DANCE, SAY SOMETHING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make the penguin say something before it dances. You can add speech bubbles for characters using the purple Say block. Tap the purple button in the block categories area to reveal the <em>looks blocks</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_17"></a>
 Drag the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Let’s change the text of the Say block from “hi” to “Let’s dance!” First, tap the word <em>hi</em>
 to make the keyboard appear. Use the backspace key to delete <em>hi</em>
 , and then type <strong>Let’s dance!</strong>
 or whatever you want the penguin to say.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_18"></a>
 Add some blue motion blocks to make the penguin dance, and then put a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block at the beginning of the penguin’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now try it out by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll see that the scripts for the cat and the penguin start running at the same time. When you tap the Green Flag button, it will run every script that begins with a Start on Green Flag block for every character, all at the same time. This will be really useful as you make bigger projects with more characters.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec08">
<strong>STEP 8: ADD A TITLE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can display a title on the stage by tapping the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen. In the window that pops up, type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can drag the title around the screen and place it anywhere you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 () and <strong>Change Color</strong>
 () buttons to change the size and color of the title you give your project. Play around and see what suits your stage best. Press <strong>Go</strong>
 to try it out on the stage. If you want to edit the title again, you can tap on the words to bring the text window back up.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_19"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec09">
<strong>STEP 9: NAME YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now give your project a name so that when you open ScratchJr again and see your projects on the home screen, you’ll know which project is which.</p>
<p class="indent">To name your project, tap the yellow tab in the top-right corner of the screen. Then delete the current project name (<em>Project 1</em>
 ) and type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 . When you’re ready to return to the main screen, tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<div class="image"><a id="page_20"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">If you want to send your project to someone else who has ScratchJr, you can do that from this screen too. For more details on how to share your projects, see the Frequently Asked Questions on the ScratchJr website (<em>
<a href="http://www.scratchjr.org/about.html#faq">http://www.scratchjr.org/about.html#faq</a>

 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You’re almost finished, but you have one important step left!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec10">
<strong>STEP 10: SAVE YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To save your project and go back to the home screen, tap the <strong>Home</strong>
 button () in the top-left corner. Your project will not be saved until you return to the home screen, so it’s a good idea to do this a few times while you are working on your project so that you don’t lose anything.</p>
<p class="indent">To continue working on your project, just tap the small image of the project on the home screen. This will take you back to the ScratchJr editor for that project.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec11"><a id="page_21"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The ScratchJr characters are all either facing forward or facing right when you first add them to your stage. If you want a character to face to the left, drag a Move Left block to the programming area and tap the block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The character will turn to the left and take a step. You can then delete this block and the character will continue to face left.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec12">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr makes different sounds when you perform different actions on the interface. These sounds can be very useful when you first start using ScratchJr. For example, when you have successfully snapped blocks together in a script, you’ll hear a “pop.” If you want to turn the sounds off, however, you can just turn the volume off on your device.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec11">
<strong>DON’T BE AFRAID TO EXPLORE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you explore the various features of ScratchJr, you should feel free to experiment, try new features, and test out new blocks. You can make your project whatever you want it to be in many ways: you could move your party to the beach, put a boat in the background, add more characters, or do almost anything else you want to do. A good feature of ScratchJr is that if you decide you don’t like any of the changes you’ve made, you can easily get rid of them.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ll show you some simple ways to do this.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec13"><a id="page_22"></a>

<strong>STEP 10: SAVE YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To save your project and go back to the home screen, tap the <strong>Home</strong>
 button () in the top-left corner. Your project will not be saved until you return to the home screen, so it’s a good idea to do this a few times while you are working on your project so that you don’t lose anything.</p>
<p class="indent">To continue working on your project, just tap the small image of the project on the home screen. This will take you back to the ScratchJr editor for that project.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec11"><a id="page_21"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The ScratchJr characters are all either facing forward or facing right when you first add them to your stage. If you want a character to face to the left, drag a Move Left block to the programming area and tap the block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The character will turn to the left and take a step. You can then delete this block and the character will continue to face left.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec12">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr makes different sounds when you perform different actions on the interface. These sounds can be very useful when you first start using ScratchJr. For example, when you have successfully snapped blocks together in a script, you’ll hear a “pop.” If you want to turn the sounds off, however, you can just turn the volume off on your device.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec11">
<strong>DON’T BE AFRAID TO EXPLORE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you explore the various features of ScratchJr, you should feel free to experiment, try new features, and test out new blocks. You can make your project whatever you want it to be in many ways: you could move your party to the beach, put a boat in the background, add more characters, or do almost anything else you want to do. A good feature of ScratchJr is that if you decide you don’t like any of the changes you’ve made, you can easily get rid of them.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ll show you some simple ways to do this.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec13"><a id="page_22"></a>
 <strong>UNDOING AND REDOING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can undo your most recent actions by tapping the Undo button at the far end of the blocks palette. If you tap the Undo button multiple times, you will undo more and more of your work, one step at a time.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If you’ve undone several steps, the Redo button will reverse the most recent Undo.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec14">
<strong>DELETING OBJECTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To delete something from ScratchJr, press it with your finger and hold it for a few seconds (sometimes called a <em>long press</em>
 ) until you see a red X appear on the object. Tap the X to delete the object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use this process to delete a character within a project or even delete an entire project from the home screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec15">
<strong>DELETING BLOCKS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To get rid of a block or even a whole script from the programming area, just drag it back up to the blocks palette and let go. You can have any color palette showing to do this; the palette doesn’t have to be the same color as the blocks you are deleting.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec12"><a id="page_23"></a>
 <strong>A GUIDED TOUR OF THE SCRATCHJR INTERFACE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have a good grasp of the basics, you can take a look at all the buttons and features. Try a few of the ones we skipped earlier. If you feel overwhelmed, don’t worry: the rest of the book’s projects will show you how to use everything! It’s okay to skip ahead and refer back here when you need to.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s start with the buttons at the top of the editor.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec05"><a id="page_13"></a>
 <strong>STEP 5: ADD A BACKGROUND</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s get the cat to dance on a stage, instead of just a plain white background. Select a new background by tapping on the button with the blue sky and green grass at the top of the main screen. This is called the <em>Change Background button</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll see loads of backgrounds that you can choose from. For our dancing cat, let’s choose the theatre. Tap the check mark at the top to load it into your stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Congratulations! Your cat is a star!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_14"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">The cat is smiling and dancing, but it looks a bit lonely dancing on its own. . . .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec06">
<strong>STEP 6: ADD ANOTHER CHARACTER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s give your cat a friend. Tap the plus sign on the left side of your screen to add a character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_15"></a>
 If you scroll down the page, you’ll see the many characters you can choose from. Tap the character you want to add, and then tap the check mark to add it to your project. We’ve chosen the penguin.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now there are two characters on the stage. To the left of the stage is the <em>character area</em>
 , which shows you all the characters involved in your project.</p>
<p class="indent">The new character will always appear in the middle of the stage. To move the character, use your finger to drag it wherever you want on the stage. We’ve dragged each of our characters to a spotlight.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_16"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You might notice that the script you wrote for the cat disappeared after you selected a new character. Don’t worry: the script is still there! It’s in the cat’s programming area, and now the screen is showing the programming area for the penguin. Each character has its own scripts, like actors in a play. To see the cat’s script, tap the cat in the character area on the left, and you’ll see that your script is still there. Then select the penguin again so that you can give it dance moves of its own.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec07">
<strong>STEP 7: DON’T JUST DANCE, SAY SOMETHING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make the penguin say something before it dances. You can add speech bubbles for characters using the purple Say block. Tap the purple button in the block categories area to reveal the <em>looks blocks</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_17"></a>
 Drag the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Let’s change the text of the Say block from “hi” to “Let’s dance!” First, tap the word <em>hi</em>
 to make the keyboard appear. Use the backspace key to delete <em>hi</em>
 , and then type <strong>Let’s dance!</strong>
 or whatever you want the penguin to say.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_18"></a>
 Add some blue motion blocks to make the penguin dance, and then put a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block at the beginning of the penguin’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now try it out by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll see that the scripts for the cat and the penguin start running at the same time. When you tap the Green Flag button, it will run every script that begins with a Start on Green Flag block for every character, all at the same time. This will be really useful as you make bigger projects with more characters.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec08">
<strong>STEP 8: ADD A TITLE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can display a title on the stage by tapping the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen. In the window that pops up, type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can drag the title around the screen and place it anywhere you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 () and <strong>Change Color</strong>
 () buttons to change the size and color of the title you give your project. Play around and see what suits your stage best. Press <strong>Go</strong>
 to try it out on the stage. If you want to edit the title again, you can tap on the words to bring the text window back up.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_19"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec09">
<strong>STEP 9: NAME YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now give your project a name so that when you open ScratchJr again and see your projects on the home screen, you’ll know which project is which.</p>
<p class="indent">To name your project, tap the yellow tab in the top-right corner of the screen. Then delete the current project name (<em>Project 1</em>
 ) and type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 . When you’re ready to return to the main screen, tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<div class="image"><a id="page_20"></a>

<p class="noindent">Now give your project a name so that when you open ScratchJr again and see your projects on the home screen, you’ll know which project is which.</p>
<p class="indent">To name your project, tap the yellow tab in the top-right corner of the screen. Then delete the current project name (<em>Project 1</em>
 ) and type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 . When you’re ready to return to the main screen, tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<div class="image"><a id="page_20"></a>

<p class="indent">If you want to send your project to someone else who has ScratchJr, you can do that from this screen too. For more details on how to share your projects, see the Frequently Asked Questions on the ScratchJr website (<em>

 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You’re almost finished, but you have one important step left!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec10">
<strong>STEP 10: SAVE YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To save your project and go back to the home screen, tap the <strong>Home</strong>
 button () in the top-left corner. Your project will not be saved until you return to the home screen, so it’s a good idea to do this a few times while you are working on your project so that you don’t lose anything.</p>
<p class="indent">To continue working on your project, just tap the small image of the project on the home screen. This will take you back to the ScratchJr editor for that project.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec11"><a id="page_21"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The ScratchJr characters are all either facing forward or facing right when you first add them to your stage. If you want a character to face to the left, drag a Move Left block to the programming area and tap the block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The character will turn to the left and take a step. You can then delete this block and the character will continue to face left.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec12">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr makes different sounds when you perform different actions on the interface. These sounds can be very useful when you first start using ScratchJr. For example, when you have successfully snapped blocks together in a script, you’ll hear a “pop.” If you want to turn the sounds off, however, you can just turn the volume off on your device.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec11">
<strong>DON’T BE AFRAID TO EXPLORE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you explore the various features of ScratchJr, you should feel free to experiment, try new features, and test out new blocks. You can make your project whatever you want it to be in many ways: you could move your party to the beach, put a boat in the background, add more characters, or do almost anything else you want to do. A good feature of ScratchJr is that if you decide you don’t like any of the changes you’ve made, you can easily get rid of them.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ll show you some simple ways to do this.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec13"><a id="page_22"></a>
 <strong>UNDOING AND REDOING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can undo your most recent actions by tapping the Undo button at the far end of the blocks palette. If you tap the Undo button multiple times, you will undo more and more of your work, one step at a time.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If you’ve undone several steps, the Redo button will reverse the most recent Undo.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec14">
<strong>DELETING OBJECTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To delete something from ScratchJr, press it with your finger and hold it for a few seconds (sometimes called a <em>long press</em>
 ) until you see a red X appear on the object. Tap the X to delete the object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use this process to delete a character within a project or even delete an entire project from the home screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec15">
<strong>DELETING BLOCKS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To get rid of a block or even a whole script from the programming area, just drag it back up to the blocks palette and let go. You can have any color palette showing to do this; the palette doesn’t have to be the same color as the blocks you are deleting.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec12"><a id="page_23"></a>
 <strong>A GUIDED TOUR OF THE SCRATCHJR INTERFACE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have a good grasp of the basics, you can take a look at all the buttons and features. Try a few of the ones we skipped earlier. If you feel overwhelmed, don’t worry: the rest of the book’s projects will show you how to use everything! It’s okay to skip ahead and refer back here when you need to.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s start with the buttons at the top of the editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<div class="image"><a id="page_24"></a>
</div>
<div class="image"><a id="page_25"></a>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec13">
<strong>WHAT’S NEXT?</strong>
</h3>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Congratulations! Your cat is a star!</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_14"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">The cat is smiling and dancing, but it looks a bit lonely dancing on its own. . . .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec06">
<strong>STEP 6: ADD ANOTHER CHARACTER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s give your cat a friend. Tap the plus sign on the left side of your screen to add a character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_15"></a>
 If you scroll down the page, you’ll see the many characters you can choose from. Tap the character you want to add, and then tap the check mark to add it to your project. We’ve chosen the penguin.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now there are two characters on the stage. To the left of the stage is the <em>character area</em>
 , which shows you all the characters involved in your project.</p>
<p class="indent">The new character will always appear in the middle of the stage. To move the character, use your finger to drag it wherever you want on the stage. We’ve dragged each of our characters to a spotlight.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_16"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You might notice that the script you wrote for the cat disappeared after you selected a new character. Don’t worry: the script is still there! It’s in the cat’s programming area, and now the screen is showing the programming area for the penguin. Each character has its own scripts, like actors in a play. To see the cat’s script, tap the cat in the character area on the left, and you’ll see that your script is still there. Then select the penguin again so that you can give it dance moves of its own.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec07">
<strong>STEP 7: DON’T JUST DANCE, SAY SOMETHING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make the penguin say something before it dances. You can add speech bubbles for characters using the purple Say block. Tap the purple button in the block categories area to reveal the <em>looks blocks</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_17"></a>
 Drag the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Let’s change the text of the Say block from “hi” to “Let’s dance!” First, tap the word <em>hi</em>
 to make the keyboard appear. Use the backspace key to delete <em>hi</em>
 , and then type <strong>Let’s dance!</strong>
 or whatever you want the penguin to say.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_18"></a>
 Add some blue motion blocks to make the penguin dance, and then put a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block at the beginning of the penguin’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now try it out by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll see that the scripts for the cat and the penguin start running at the same time. When you tap the Green Flag button, it will run every script that begins with a Start on Green Flag block for every character, all at the same time. This will be really useful as you make bigger projects with more characters.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec08">
<strong>STEP 8: ADD A TITLE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can display a title on the stage by tapping the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen. In the window that pops up, type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can drag the title around the screen and place it anywhere you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 () and <strong>Change Color</strong>
 () buttons to change the size and color of the title you give your project. Play around and see what suits your stage best. Press <strong>Go</strong>
 to try it out on the stage. If you want to edit the title again, you can tap on the words to bring the text window back up.</p>

<p class="indent">You’re almost finished, but you have one important step left!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec10">
<strong>STEP 10: SAVE YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To save your project and go back to the home screen, tap the <strong>Home</strong>
 button () in the top-left corner. Your project will not be saved until you return to the home screen, so it’s a good idea to do this a few times while you are working on your project so that you don’t lose anything.</p>
<p class="indent">To continue working on your project, just tap the small image of the project on the home screen. This will take you back to the ScratchJr editor for that project.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec11"><a id="page_21"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The ScratchJr characters are all either facing forward or facing right when you first add them to your stage. If you want a character to face to the left, drag a Move Left block to the programming area and tap the block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The character will turn to the left and take a step. You can then delete this block and the character will continue to face left.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec12">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr makes different sounds when you perform different actions on the interface. These sounds can be very useful when you first start using ScratchJr. For example, when you have successfully snapped blocks together in a script, you’ll hear a “pop.” If you want to turn the sounds off, however, you can just turn the volume off on your device.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec11">
<strong>DON’T BE AFRAID TO EXPLORE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you explore the various features of ScratchJr, you should feel free to experiment, try new features, and test out new blocks. You can make your project whatever you want it to be in many ways: you could move your party to the beach, put a boat in the background, add more characters, or do almost anything else you want to do. A good feature of ScratchJr is that if you decide you don’t like any of the changes you’ve made, you can easily get rid of them.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ll show you some simple ways to do this.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec13"><a id="page_22"></a>
 <strong>UNDOING AND REDOING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can undo your most recent actions by tapping the Undo button at the far end of the blocks palette. If you tap the Undo button multiple times, you will undo more and more of your work, one step at a time.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If you’ve undone several steps, the Redo button will reverse the most recent Undo.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec14">
<strong>DELETING OBJECTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To delete something from ScratchJr, press it with your finger and hold it for a few seconds (sometimes called a <em>long press</em>
 ) until you see a red X appear on the object. Tap the X to delete the object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use this process to delete a character within a project or even delete an entire project from the home screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec15">
<strong>DELETING BLOCKS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To get rid of a block or even a whole script from the programming area, just drag it back up to the blocks palette and let go. You can have any color palette showing to do this; the palette doesn’t have to be the same color as the blocks you are deleting.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec12"><a id="page_23"></a>
 <strong>A GUIDED TOUR OF THE SCRATCHJR INTERFACE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have a good grasp of the basics, you can take a look at all the buttons and features. Try a few of the ones we skipped earlier. If you feel overwhelmed, don’t worry: the rest of the book’s projects will show you how to use everything! It’s okay to skip ahead and refer back here when you need to.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s start with the buttons at the top of the editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>

<strong>STEP 6: ADD ANOTHER CHARACTER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s give your cat a friend. Tap the plus sign on the left side of your screen to add a character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_15"></a>
 If you scroll down the page, you’ll see the many characters you can choose from. Tap the character you want to add, and then tap the check mark to add it to your project. We’ve chosen the penguin.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now there are two characters on the stage. To the left of the stage is the <em>character area</em>
 , which shows you all the characters involved in your project.</p>
<p class="indent">The new character will always appear in the middle of the stage. To move the character, use your finger to drag it wherever you want on the stage. We’ve dragged each of our characters to a spotlight.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_16"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You might notice that the script you wrote for the cat disappeared after you selected a new character. Don’t worry: the script is still there! It’s in the cat’s programming area, and now the screen is showing the programming area for the penguin. Each character has its own scripts, like actors in a play. To see the cat’s script, tap the cat in the character area on the left, and you’ll see that your script is still there. Then select the penguin again so that you can give it dance moves of its own.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec07">
<strong>STEP 7: DON’T JUST DANCE, SAY SOMETHING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make the penguin say something before it dances. You can add speech bubbles for characters using the purple Say block. Tap the purple button in the block categories area to reveal the <em>looks blocks</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_17"></a>
 Drag the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Let’s change the text of the Say block from “hi” to “Let’s dance!” First, tap the word <em>hi</em>
 to make the keyboard appear. Use the backspace key to delete <em>hi</em>
 , and then type <strong>Let’s dance!</strong>
 or whatever you want the penguin to say.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_18"></a>
 Add some blue motion blocks to make the penguin dance, and then put a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block at the beginning of the penguin’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now try it out by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll see that the scripts for the cat and the penguin start running at the same time. When you tap the Green Flag button, it will run every script that begins with a Start on Green Flag block for every character, all at the same time. This will be really useful as you make bigger projects with more characters.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec08">
<strong>STEP 8: ADD A TITLE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can display a title on the stage by tapping the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen. In the window that pops up, type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can drag the title around the screen and place it anywhere you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 () and <strong>Change Color</strong>
 () buttons to change the size and color of the title you give your project. Play around and see what suits your stage best. Press <strong>Go</strong>
 to try it out on the stage. If you want to edit the title again, you can tap on the words to bring the text window back up.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_19"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec09">
<strong>STEP 9: NAME YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now give your project a name so that when you open ScratchJr again and see your projects on the home screen, you’ll know which project is which.</p>
<p class="indent">To name your project, tap the yellow tab in the top-right corner of the screen. Then delete the current project name (<em>Project 1</em>
 ) and type <strong>Dance Party</strong>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr makes different sounds when you perform different actions on the interface. These sounds can be very useful when you first start using ScratchJr. For example, when you have successfully snapped blocks together in a script, you’ll hear a “pop.” If you want to turn the sounds off, however, you can just turn the volume off on your device.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec11">
<strong>DON’T BE AFRAID TO EXPLORE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you explore the various features of ScratchJr, you should feel free to experiment, try new features, and test out new blocks. You can make your project whatever you want it to be in many ways: you could move your party to the beach, put a boat in the background, add more characters, or do almost anything else you want to do. A good feature of ScratchJr is that if you decide you don’t like any of the changes you’ve made, you can easily get rid of them.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ll show you some simple ways to do this.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec13"><a id="page_22"></a>
 <strong>UNDOING AND REDOING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can undo your most recent actions by tapping the Undo button at the far end of the blocks palette. If you tap the Undo button multiple times, you will undo more and more of your work, one step at a time.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If you’ve undone several steps, the Redo button will reverse the most recent Undo.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec14">
<strong>DELETING OBJECTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To delete something from ScratchJr, press it with your finger and hold it for a few seconds (sometimes called a <em>long press</em>
 ) until you see a red X appear on the object. Tap the X to delete the object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use this process to delete a character within a project or even delete an entire project from the home screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec15">
<strong>DELETING BLOCKS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To get rid of a block or even a whole script from the programming area, just drag it back up to the blocks palette and let go. You can have any color palette showing to do this; the palette doesn’t have to be the same color as the blocks you are deleting.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec12"><a id="page_23"></a>
 <strong>A GUIDED TOUR OF THE SCRATCHJR INTERFACE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have a good grasp of the basics, you can take a look at all the buttons and features. Try a few of the ones we skipped earlier. If you feel overwhelmed, don’t worry: the rest of the book’s projects will show you how to use everything! It’s okay to skip ahead and refer back here when you need to.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s start with the buttons at the top of the editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<div class="image"><a id="page_24"></a>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec13">
<strong>WHAT’S NEXT?</strong>
</h3>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now there are two characters on the stage. To the left of the stage is the <em>character area</em>
 , which shows you all the characters involved in your project.</p>
<p class="indent">The new character will always appear in the middle of the stage. To move the character, use your finger to drag it wherever you want on the stage. We’ve dragged each of our characters to a spotlight.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_16"></a>
</div>
<p class="indent">You might notice that the script you wrote for the cat disappeared after you selected a new character. Don’t worry: the script is still there! It’s in the cat’s programming area, and now the screen is showing the programming area for the penguin. Each character has its own scripts, like actors in a play. To see the cat’s script, tap the cat in the character area on the left, and you’ll see that your script is still there. Then select the penguin again so that you can give it dance moves of its own.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec07">
<strong>STEP 7: DON’T JUST DANCE, SAY SOMETHING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make the penguin say something before it dances. You can add speech bubbles for characters using the purple Say block. Tap the purple button in the block categories area to reveal the <em>looks blocks</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_17"></a>
 Drag the <strong>Say</strong>
 block to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Let’s change the text of the Say block from “hi” to “Let’s dance!” First, tap the word <em>hi</em>
 to make the keyboard appear. Use the backspace key to delete <em>hi</em>
 , and then type <strong>Let’s dance!</strong>
 or whatever you want the penguin to say.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_18"></a>
 Add some blue motion blocks to make the penguin dance, and then put a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block at the beginning of the penguin’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now try it out by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll see that the scripts for the cat and the penguin start running at the same time. When you tap the Green Flag button, it will run every script that begins with a Start on Green Flag block for every character, all at the same time. This will be really useful as you make bigger projects with more characters.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec08">
<strong>STEP 8: ADD A TITLE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can display a title on the stage by tapping the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen. In the window that pops up, type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can drag the title around the screen and place it anywhere you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 () and <strong>Change Color</strong>
 () buttons to change the size and color of the title you give your project. Play around and see what suits your stage best. Press <strong>Go</strong>
 to try it out on the stage. If you want to edit the title again, you can tap on the words to bring the text window back up.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_19"></a>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec09">
<strong>STEP 9: NAME YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now give your project a name so that when you open ScratchJr again and see your projects on the home screen, you’ll know which project is which.</p>
<p class="indent">To name your project, tap the yellow tab in the top-right corner of the screen. Then delete the current project name (<em>Project 1</em>
 ) and type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 . When you’re ready to return to the main screen, tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<div class="image"><a id="page_20"></a>

<p class="indent">If you want to send your project to someone else who has ScratchJr, you can do that from this screen too. For more details on how to share your projects, see the Frequently Asked Questions on the ScratchJr website (<em>

<p class="indent">You’re almost finished, but you have one important step left!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec10">
<strong>STEP 10: SAVE YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To save your project and go back to the home screen, tap the <strong>Home</strong>
 button () in the top-left corner. Your project will not be saved until you return to the home screen, so it’s a good idea to do this a few times while you are working on your project so that you don’t lose anything.</p>
<p class="indent">To continue working on your project, just tap the small image of the project on the home screen. This will take you back to the ScratchJr editor for that project.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec11"><a id="page_21"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The ScratchJr characters are all either facing forward or facing right when you first add them to your stage. If you want a character to face to the left, drag a Move Left block to the programming area and tap the block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The character will turn to the left and take a step. You can then delete this block and the character will continue to face left.</p>

<p class="indent">You might notice that the script you wrote for the cat disappeared after you selected a new character. Don’t worry: the script is still there! It’s in the cat’s programming area, and now the screen is showing the programming area for the penguin. Each character has its own scripts, like actors in a play. To see the cat’s script, tap the cat in the character area on the left, and you’ll see that your script is still there. Then select the penguin again so that you can give it dance moves of its own.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec07">
<strong>STEP 7: DON’T JUST DANCE, SAY SOMETHING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s make the penguin say something before it dances. You can add speech bubbles for characters using the purple Say block. Tap the purple button in the block categories area to reveal the <em>looks blocks</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_17"></a>

 or whatever you want the penguin to say.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_18"></a>
 Add some blue motion blocks to make the penguin dance, and then put a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block at the beginning of the penguin’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now try it out by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll see that the scripts for the cat and the penguin start running at the same time. When you tap the Green Flag button, it will run every script that begins with a Start on Green Flag block for every character, all at the same time. This will be really useful as you make bigger projects with more characters.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec08">
<strong>STEP 8: ADD A TITLE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can display a title on the stage by tapping the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen. In the window that pops up, type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can drag the title around the screen and place it anywhere you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 () and <strong>Change Color</strong>
 () buttons to change the size and color of the title you give your project. Play around and see what suits your stage best. Press <strong>Go</strong>
 to try it out on the stage. If you want to edit the title again, you can tap on the words to bring the text window back up.</p>

<p class="noindent">To save your project and go back to the home screen, tap the <strong>Home</strong>

 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The ScratchJr characters are all either facing forward or facing right when you first add them to your stage. If you want a character to face to the left, drag a Move Left block to the programming area and tap the block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The character will turn to the left and take a step. You can then delete this block and the character will continue to face left.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec12">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr makes different sounds when you perform different actions on the interface. These sounds can be very useful when you first start using ScratchJr. For example, when you have successfully snapped blocks together in a script, you’ll hear a “pop.” If you want to turn the sounds off, however, you can just turn the volume off on your device.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec11">
<strong>DON’T BE AFRAID TO EXPLORE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you explore the various features of ScratchJr, you should feel free to experiment, try new features, and test out new blocks. You can make your project whatever you want it to be in many ways: you could move your party to the beach, put a boat in the background, add more characters, or do almost anything else you want to do. A good feature of ScratchJr is that if you decide you don’t like any of the changes you’ve made, you can easily get rid of them.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec13"><a id="page_22"></a>
 <strong>UNDOING AND REDOING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can undo your most recent actions by tapping the Undo button at the far end of the blocks palette. If you tap the Undo button multiple times, you will undo more and more of your work, one step at a time.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If you’ve undone several steps, the Redo button will reverse the most recent Undo.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec14">
<strong>DELETING OBJECTS</strong>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec15">
<strong>DELETING BLOCKS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To get rid of a block or even a whole script from the programming area, just drag it back up to the blocks palette and let go. You can have any color palette showing to do this; the palette doesn’t have to be the same color as the blocks you are deleting.</p>

</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can undo your most recent actions by tapping the Undo button at the far end of the blocks palette. If you tap the Undo button multiple times, you will undo more and more of your work, one step at a time.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If you’ve undone several steps, the Redo button will reverse the most recent Undo.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec14">
<strong>DELETING OBJECTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To delete something from ScratchJr, press it with your finger and hold it for a few seconds (sometimes called a <em>long press</em>
 ) until you see a red X appear on the object. Tap the X to delete the object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use this process to delete a character within a project or even delete an entire project from the home screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec15">
<strong>DELETING BLOCKS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To get rid of a block or even a whole script from the programming area, just drag it back up to the blocks palette and let go. You can have any color palette showing to do this; the palette doesn’t have to be the same color as the blocks you are deleting.</p>

 <strong>A GUIDED TOUR OF THE SCRATCHJR INTERFACE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have a good grasp of the basics, you can take a look at all the buttons and features. Try a few of the ones we skipped earlier. If you feel overwhelmed, don’t worry: the rest of the book’s projects will show you how to use everything! It’s okay to skip ahead and refer back here when you need to.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s start with the buttons at the top of the editor.</p>
<div class="image"></div>

<p class="indent">Let’s change the text of the Say block from “hi” to “Let’s dance!” First, tap the word <em>hi</em>
 to make the keyboard appear. Use the backspace key to delete <em>hi</em>
 , and then type <strong>Let’s dance!</strong>
 or whatever you want the penguin to say.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_18"></a>
 Add some blue motion blocks to make the penguin dance, and then put a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block at the beginning of the penguin’s script.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Now try it out by tapping the <strong>Green Flag</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll see that the scripts for the cat and the penguin start running at the same time. When you tap the Green Flag button, it will run every script that begins with a Start on Green Flag block for every character, all at the same time. This will be really useful as you make bigger projects with more characters.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec08">
<strong>STEP 8: ADD A TITLE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can display a title on the stage by tapping the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen. In the window that pops up, type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can drag the title around the screen and place it anywhere you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 () and <strong>Change Color</strong>
 () buttons to change the size and color of the title you give your project. Play around and see what suits your stage best. Press <strong>Go</strong>
 to try it out on the stage. If you want to edit the title again, you can tap on the words to bring the text window back up.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_19"></a>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec09">
<strong>STEP 9: NAME YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now give your project a name so that when you open ScratchJr again and see your projects on the home screen, you’ll know which project is which.</p>
<p class="indent">To name your project, tap the yellow tab in the top-right corner of the screen. Then delete the current project name (<em>Project 1</em>
 ) and type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 . When you’re ready to return to the main screen, tap the check mark.</p>

<p class="indent">You’re almost finished, but you have one important step left!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec10">
<strong>STEP 10: SAVE YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To save your project and go back to the home screen, tap the <strong>Home</strong>
 button () in the top-left corner. Your project will not be saved until you return to the home screen, so it’s a good idea to do this a few times while you are working on your project so that you don’t lose anything.</p>
<p class="indent">To continue working on your project, just tap the small image of the project on the home screen. This will take you back to the ScratchJr editor for that project.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec11"><a id="page_21"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The ScratchJr characters are all either facing forward or facing right when you first add them to your stage. If you want a character to face to the left, drag a Move Left block to the programming area and tap the block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The character will turn to the left and take a step. You can then delete this block and the character will continue to face left.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec12">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr makes different sounds when you perform different actions on the interface. These sounds can be very useful when you first start using ScratchJr. For example, when you have successfully snapped blocks together in a script, you’ll hear a “pop.” If you want to turn the sounds off, however, you can just turn the volume off on your device.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec11">
<strong>DON’T BE AFRAID TO EXPLORE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you explore the various features of ScratchJr, you should feel free to experiment, try new features, and test out new blocks. You can make your project whatever you want it to be in many ways: you could move your party to the beach, put a boat in the background, add more characters, or do almost anything else you want to do. A good feature of ScratchJr is that if you decide you don’t like any of the changes you’ve made, you can easily get rid of them.</p>

<strong>STEP 8: ADD A TITLE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can display a title on the stage by tapping the <strong>Add Text</strong>
 button () at the top of the screen. In the window that pops up, type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can drag the title around the screen and place it anywhere you want.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also use the <strong>Change Size</strong>
 () and <strong>Change Color</strong>
 () buttons to change the size and color of the title you give your project. Play around and see what suits your stage best. Press <strong>Go</strong>
 to try it out on the stage. If you want to edit the title again, you can tap on the words to bring the text window back up.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec09">
<strong>STEP 9: NAME YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now give your project a name so that when you open ScratchJr again and see your projects on the home screen, you’ll know which project is which.</p>
<p class="indent">To name your project, tap the yellow tab in the top-right corner of the screen. Then delete the current project name (<em>Project 1</em>
 ) and type <strong>Dance Party</strong>
 . When you’re ready to return to the main screen, tap the check mark.</p>

<p class="indent">You’re almost finished, but you have one important step left!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec10">
<strong>STEP 10: SAVE YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To save your project and go back to the home screen, tap the <strong>Home</strong>
 button () in the top-left corner. Your project will not be saved until you return to the home screen, so it’s a good idea to do this a few times while you are working on your project so that you don’t lose anything.</p>
<p class="indent">To continue working on your project, just tap the small image of the project on the home screen. This will take you back to the ScratchJr editor for that project.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec11"><a id="page_21"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The ScratchJr characters are all either facing forward or facing right when you first add them to your stage. If you want a character to face to the left, drag a Move Left block to the programming area and tap the block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The character will turn to the left and take a step. You can then delete this block and the character will continue to face left.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec12">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr makes different sounds when you perform different actions on the interface. These sounds can be very useful when you first start using ScratchJr. For example, when you have successfully snapped blocks together in a script, you’ll hear a “pop.” If you want to turn the sounds off, however, you can just turn the volume off on your device.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec11">
<strong>DON’T BE AFRAID TO EXPLORE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you explore the various features of ScratchJr, you should feel free to experiment, try new features, and test out new blocks. You can make your project whatever you want it to be in many ways: you could move your party to the beach, put a boat in the background, add more characters, or do almost anything else you want to do. A good feature of ScratchJr is that if you decide you don’t like any of the changes you’ve made, you can easily get rid of them.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ll show you some simple ways to do this.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec13"><a id="page_22"></a>
 <strong>UNDOING AND REDOING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can undo your most recent actions by tapping the Undo button at the far end of the blocks palette. If you tap the Undo button multiple times, you will undo more and more of your work, one step at a time.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If you’ve undone several steps, the Redo button will reverse the most recent Undo.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec14">
<strong>DELETING OBJECTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To delete something from ScratchJr, press it with your finger and hold it for a few seconds (sometimes called a <em>long press</em>
 ) until you see a red X appear on the object. Tap the X to delete the object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use this process to delete a character within a project or even delete an entire project from the home screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec15">
<strong>DELETING BLOCKS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To get rid of a block or even a whole script from the programming area, just drag it back up to the blocks palette and let go. You can have any color palette showing to do this; the palette doesn’t have to be the same color as the blocks you are deleting.</p>

<strong>DELETING OBJECTS</strong>

<p class="noindent">To delete something from ScratchJr, press it with your finger and hold it for a few seconds (sometimes called a <em>long press</em>
 ) until you see a red X appear on the object. Tap the X to delete the object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use this process to delete a character within a project or even delete an entire project from the home screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec15">
<strong>DELETING BLOCKS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To get rid of a block or even a whole script from the programming area, just drag it back up to the blocks palette and let go. You can have any color palette showing to do this; the palette doesn’t have to be the same color as the blocks you are deleting.</p>

<strong>STEP 9: NAME YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now give your project a name so that when you open ScratchJr again and see your projects on the home screen, you’ll know which project is which.</p>
<p class="indent">To name your project, tap the yellow tab in the top-right corner of the screen. Then delete the current project name (<em>Project 1</em>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec10">
<strong>STEP 10: SAVE YOUR PROJECT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To save your project and go back to the home screen, tap the <strong>Home</strong>
 button () in the top-left corner. Your project will not be saved until you return to the home screen, so it’s a good idea to do this a few times while you are working on your project so that you don’t lose anything.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec11"><a id="page_21"></a>
 <strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The ScratchJr characters are all either facing forward or facing right when you first add them to your stage. If you want a character to face to the left, drag a Move Left block to the programming area and tap the block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The character will turn to the left and take a step. You can then delete this block and the character will continue to face left.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec12">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr makes different sounds when you perform different actions on the interface. These sounds can be very useful when you first start using ScratchJr. For example, when you have successfully snapped blocks together in a script, you’ll hear a “pop.” If you want to turn the sounds off, however, you can just turn the volume off on your device.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec11">
<strong>DON’T BE AFRAID TO EXPLORE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you explore the various features of ScratchJr, you should feel free to experiment, try new features, and test out new blocks. You can make your project whatever you want it to be in many ways: you could move your party to the beach, put a boat in the background, add more characters, or do almost anything else you want to do. A good feature of ScratchJr is that if you decide you don’t like any of the changes you’ve made, you can easily get rid of them.</p>

<p class="indent">The character will turn to the left and take a step. You can then delete this block and the character will continue to face left.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr makes different sounds when you perform different actions on the interface. These sounds can be very useful when you first start using ScratchJr. For example, when you have successfully snapped blocks together in a script, you’ll hear a “pop.” If you want to turn the sounds off, however, you can just turn the volume off on your device.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec11">
<strong>DON’T BE AFRAID TO EXPLORE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you explore the various features of ScratchJr, you should feel free to experiment, try new features, and test out new blocks. You can make your project whatever you want it to be in many ways: you could move your party to the beach, put a boat in the background, add more characters, or do almost anything else you want to do. A good feature of ScratchJr is that if you decide you don’t like any of the changes you’ve made, you can easily get rid of them.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ll show you some simple ways to do this.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec13"><a id="page_22"></a>
 <strong>UNDOING AND REDOING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can undo your most recent actions by tapping the Undo button at the far end of the blocks palette. If you tap the Undo button multiple times, you will undo more and more of your work, one step at a time.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If you’ve undone several steps, the Redo button will reverse the most recent Undo.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec14">
<strong>DELETING OBJECTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To delete something from ScratchJr, press it with your finger and hold it for a few seconds (sometimes called a <em>long press</em>
 ) until you see a red X appear on the object. Tap the X to delete the object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use this process to delete a character within a project or even delete an entire project from the home screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec15">
<strong>DELETING BLOCKS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To get rid of a block or even a whole script from the programming area, just drag it back up to the blocks palette and let go. You can have any color palette showing to do this; the palette doesn’t have to be the same color as the blocks you are deleting.</p>

</h4>
<p class="noindent">To save your project and go back to the home screen, tap the <strong>Home</strong>
 button () in the top-left corner. Your project will not be saved until you return to the home screen, so it’s a good idea to do this a few times while you are working on your project so that you don’t lose anything.</p>

<p class="noindent">To delete something from ScratchJr, press it with your finger and hold it for a few seconds (sometimes called a <em>long press</em>
 ) until you see a red X appear on the object. Tap the X to delete the object.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can use this process to delete a character within a project or even delete an entire project from the home screen.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec15">
<strong>DELETING BLOCKS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">To get rid of a block or even a whole script from the programming area, just drag it back up to the blocks palette and let go. You can have any color palette showing to do this; the palette doesn’t have to be the same color as the blocks you are deleting.</p>

 <strong>A GUIDED TOUR OF THE SCRATCHJR INTERFACE</strong>

<p class="noindent">Now that you have a good grasp of the basics, you can take a look at all the buttons and features. Try a few of the ones we skipped earlier. If you feel overwhelmed, don’t worry: the rest of the book’s projects will show you how to use everything! It’s okay to skip ahead and refer back here when you need to.</p>

<p class="noindent">ScratchJr makes different sounds when you perform different actions on the interface. These sounds can be very useful when you first start using ScratchJr. For example, when you have successfully snapped blocks together in a script, you’ll hear a “pop.” If you want to turn the sounds off, however, you can just turn the volume off on your device.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec11">
<strong>DON’T BE AFRAID TO EXPLORE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you explore the various features of ScratchJr, you should feel free to experiment, try new features, and test out new blocks. You can make your project whatever you want it to be in many ways: you could move your party to the beach, put a boat in the background, add more characters, or do almost anything else you want to do. A good feature of ScratchJr is that if you decide you don’t like any of the changes you’ve made, you can easily get rid of them.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ll show you some simple ways to do this.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec13"><a id="page_22"></a>
 <strong>UNDOING AND REDOING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can undo your most recent actions by tapping the Undo button at the far end of the blocks palette. If you tap the Undo button multiple times, you will undo more and more of your work, one step at a time.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">If you’ve undone several steps, the Redo button will reverse the most recent Undo.</p>

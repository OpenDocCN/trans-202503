    it was a remote control boat, an elevator, a vending machine, or an electronic
    toy. Or have you wanted to create your own robot or make electronic signals for
    a model railroad? Or perhaps you’d like to capture and analyze weather data over
    time? Where and how do you start?

    you find the answers to some of the mysteries of electronics in a hands-on way.
    The original creation of Massimo Banzi and David Cuartielles, the Arduino system
    offers an inexpensive way to build interactive projects, such as remote-controlled
    robots, GPS tracking systems, and electronic games.

    It’s now a thriving industry, supported by a community of people united with the
    common bond of creating something new. You’ll find individuals and groups ranging
    from small clubs to local hackerspaces to educational institutions, all interested
    in trying to make things with the Arduino.

    of which are shown in [Figure 1-2](#figure1-2). It uses an Arduino-compatible
    board with a Wi-Fi interface to receive the local weather forecast. It then displays
    the daily maximum temperature and illuminates a colored triangle to represent
    the weather forecast for the day.

    A great example is his Arduino Mini CNC Plotter. This project uses an Arduino,
    mechanisms from old CD drives, and other inexpensive items to create a computer
    numerical control (CNC) device that can draw with precision on a flat surface

    2.*x* (the exact number may change, but the instructions in this book should still
    work). Compared to version 1.*x*, version 2.*x* has some features that make writing
    and editing sketches easier, including interactive autocomplete, improved navigation
    through sketches, and more user-friendly board and library managers. Furthermore,
    a live debugger allows you to start and stop your Arduino sketch interactively
    when used with certain Arduino boards. However, if you’re new to the world of
    Arduino, you don’t need to worry about these features. Just remember that the

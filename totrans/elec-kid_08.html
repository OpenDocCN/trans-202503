<p class="noindent">In <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05">Chapter 5</a>, you used a breadboard to build new circuits. A breadboard lets you quickly test new ideas and experiment with different components to see the result, but it isn’t a permanent solution. Components can easily fall out, and there can be loose wires all over the breadboard. When you want to use a circuit for a long time without changing it, it’s better to solder the circuit to a <em>circuit board</em>. Soldering is kind of like gluing: you melt a material called <em>solder</em> onto the component legs <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_112"/>so the components stick to the circuit board. A circuit board has holes like a breadboard, and when you solder components to it, they become connected by plates of copper.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This chapter will teach you how to solder, starting with a simple LED circuit. This will give you the foundation you need to solder your own circuits later. After you’ve practiced the basics in this chapter, you’ll continue soldering in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07">Chapter 7</a> to build a touch-enabled switch and a circuit that wakes you up when the sun rises in the morning.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec01"><span class="green">HOW TO SOLDER</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindentb">To solder a circuit, you need a few tools:</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> Solder</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> A soldering iron</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> A stand to hold the soldering iron</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> A damp sponge</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> Safety goggles</p>&#13;
<p class="indentt">Solder is a mix of metals that can easily melt at high temperatures. The most commonly used solder melts at around 360 to 370 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0112-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_113"/>A <em>soldering iron</em> is a pen-shaped tool that heats up to a temperature high enough to melt solder. If you put solder on the tip of the soldering iron, the solder melts.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0113-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Soldering is quite easy once you learn the basics, and one important basic step is to take a few safety precautions.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec01"><span class="green">Soldering Safety Tips</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Soldering irons get extremely hot, and you can burn yourself if you touch the metal part of a soldering iron while it’s plugged in. Always return the soldering iron to its stand when you’re not using it; never lay it directly on a surface. Avoid touching <em>joints</em> (soldered connections) and components for a few seconds after you solder them, too. They can get hot enough to burn.</p>&#13;
<p class="indentb">Here are some other important safety tips to keep in mind while soldering:</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> Keep the hot parts of the soldering iron away from the power cord.</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> If you’re soldering on a table, protect the surface with a piece of wood or some thick cardboard.</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> Always wash your hands after handling solder.</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_114"/><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> If you do get burned, don’t panic. For a minor burn, immediately cool the burn with running cold water, keeping the burned area under water for at least five minutes. Putting ice on a burn is good, too, but make sure to do the initial cooling with water right away.</p>&#13;
<p class="indentt">Ask an adult to supervise your first few attempts at soldering, and remember: soldering is fun, but soldering irons must still be used with great care. With those tips in mind, read the rest of this section for a step-by-step guide to basic soldering.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec02"><span class="green">Heat the Soldering Iron</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The first step of soldering is to plug in your soldering iron and place it on your stand. Don’t forget to put on your safety goggles!</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0114-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">After a minute or two, check whether the iron is hot enough by touching some solder to the tip of the iron. If the solder melts, your iron is ready to go.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec03"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_115"/><span class="green">Clean the Soldering Iron Tip</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Touch the tip of your soldering iron to a damp sponge to clean it. A clean tip transfers heat much better than a dirty one, so clean the tip often.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0115-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec04"><span class="green">Tin the Soldering Iron Tip</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Here’s a little trick: to heat the joint faster, add a bit of solder to the tip of the soldering iron just before you start soldering. This is called <em>tinning</em>. This must be done just a second or two before soldering to be effective.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec05"><span class="green">Heat Both the Pin and the Pad</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Place the tip of the soldering iron onto both the component leg and the copper strip. Heat the strip and leg for a couple of seconds before you move on to the next step.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0115-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec06"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_116"/><span class="green">Add Solder</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">While keeping the soldering iron tip on the joint, touch some solder to the leg and the copper strip. As the solder melts, slowly add more until there’s just enough to coat both the leg you’re soldering and the copper strip you want to connect it to. When you have enough melted solder, remove the solder wire from the joint while still keeping the soldering iron tip on the joint.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0116-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec07"><span class="green">Remove the Soldering Iron</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Finally, remove the soldering iron tip from the joint and place the iron in its stand. Always do this last. If you remove the iron while the solder wire is touching the solder joint, the solder wire may get stuck to the circuit board when the solder joint hardens.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Your solder joint should have a cone shape.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0116-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_117"/>If you’re done soldering, then unplug the iron so it can cool down.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec08"><span class="green">Watch Out for Bad Solder Joints!</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">It’s important to heat both the component leg and the copper strip with the iron before touching solder to either. When you heat only the component leg and not the copper strip, the solder sticks to the leg, but there’s no connection between the solder and the copper strip. If only the strip is heated, the solder will stick to the strip, but not the leg. It could look like a good soldering joint from a distance, but the solder probably won’t be connected to the leg.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You must also make sure the solder doesn’t float over to another copper strip next to it. This will create an unintended connection between the two strips.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0117-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">If your solder joint doesn’t look right, don’t worry. Just reheat the joint, the component leg, and the copper strip and add more solder to achieve the cone shape of a good solder joint. Then, you should be good to go.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11"><span class="green">Step 1: Place the Components</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Look at your circuit board and get familiar with the connection pattern on it. The circuit board I recommend is called a <em>prototyping board</em>, and it’s covered with little straight strips of copper, each with lots of holes. Any component leads that you solder into holes that share a strip of copper will become electrically connected.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Place your resistor and LED legs through the circuit board. The resistor should share a copper strip with the LED’s positive lead. Note that the strips shown in the figure are on the bottom side of the board, which is why they’re not copper colored in the picture. Anytime a project involves soldering to a circuit board, I’ll show shadows of the copper strips so you can see where the connections are underneath.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0120-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12"><span class="green">Step 2: Bend the Component Legs</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Carefully flip your circuit board over so you can see the copper; hold the LED and resistor in place with a finger if needed so they don’t fall out. Then, slightly bend each component’s legs outward so that the LED and resistor stay in place even with the copper side up. Keep the board copper-side-up for now.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0120-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<div class="sidebar1">&#13;
<p class="sidebart1" id="ch06sb01"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_121"/><strong>HOW TO READ THE CIRCUIT BOARD ILLUSTRATIONS</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Throughout this book, you’ll see circuit board illustrations I created in a program called Fritzing. These illustrations show the top side of the circuit board so you can see how the components look, and they show the bottom side—a slightly darker color than the top—so you can see how the copper strips look.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When following my instructions, always orient your circuit board with the copper strips on the bottom going in the same direction shown in the illustration. If you ever get confused about how you should read the connections in a circuit board illustration, just refer back to this example.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0121-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you want to create your own circuit illustrations with Fritzing, you can download the free, open source software from <em><a href="http://www.fritzing.org/">http://www.fritzing.org/</a></em>.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec13"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_122"/><span class="green">Step 3: Heat and Clean the Soldering Iron</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Your components should be in place and ready to solder, so plug in and heat up the iron now. This may take a few minutes. As always, check to see whether the iron is hot enough by touching some solder to the tip to see whether it melts.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Before you start soldering, clean the tip of the soldering iron, too. Wet your sponge just a little bit and wring out any excess water. Then, wipe the tip of the iron on the sponge to remove any old solder.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec14"><span class="green">Step 4: Solder the Resistor and LED</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">With the copper side of the circuit board facing up, solder each component leg to the board, as described in “<a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev1sec01">How to Solder</a>” on <a href="ch06.xhtml#page_112">page 112</a>. Your board should look like this:</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0122-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec15"><span class="green">Step 5: Trim the Legs</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Right now, your LED and resistor have really long legs. You don’t want to leave them sticking out because stray metal can create unintentional paths between components. At best, that could prevent your circuit from working until you move the leg away from the component it shouldn’t be touching; at worst, an unintended connection could break a component. To prevent accidental connections, cut off each leg just above <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_123"/>the solder joint. The legs could go flying when you cut them, so turn the board away from your eyes or wear safety goggles for protection.</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="red">TIP</span></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>Hold the circuit board over an empty box while you cut the legs off, to prevent the scraps from getting lost and to make cleanup easier. You could also rest the circuit board on a table and hold the leg with one hand while you clip.</em></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0123-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec16"><span class="green">Step 6: Solder the Battery Clip</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This circuit also needs a way to connect the battery to the components, so solder the battery clip to the circuit board now.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0123-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_124"/>The red wire from the battery clip is the positive wire; connect it to the copper strip that connects only to the resistor, not the LED. The black wire is the negative lead, so connect it to the negative side of the LED. Your circuit board should now look like this:</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0124-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec17"><span class="green">Step 7: Let There Be Light!</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Now, let’s test your circuit. Plug in the battery, and your LED should light up!</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec18"><span class="green">Step 8: What If the Soldered LED Circuit Doesn’t Work?</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">If your LED doesn’t light, check that you don’t have any unintentional connections. Is solder connecting two joints that shouldn’t connect? Are extra long component legs making contact?</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Next, inspect your solder joints closely. Do any of them look like the examples of bad connections described in “<a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev2sec08">Watch Out for Bad Solder Joints!</a>” on <a href="ch06.xhtml#page_117">page 117</a>? If so, you might need to flow a little more solder: warm up your iron again and try to make sure your solder joints look like little pyramids.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Check the placement of the LED, too. Did you connect it correctly? Because you’ve cut off the excess legs, you can’t see which leg is longer anymore, but if you look closely at the LED, you should see that one side of the base of the plastic housing is flattened. This is the negative side, which should be connected <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_125"/>to the battery clip’s black wire. If you’ve placed it the wrong way, here’s one quick fix: use your wire cutters to cut the battery clip leads, removing the clip from the circuit board. Now, solder the positive battery lead where the negative lead used to be, and solder the negative battery lead where the positive lead used to be. This works because it doesn’t matter which side of the LED the resistor is on.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec03"><span class="green">OOPS! HOW DO I REMOVE A SOLDERED COMPONENT?</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Sometimes, you’ll make mistakes when soldering. For example, what if you soldered the battery clip the wrong way or used a 33,000 Ω resistor instead of a 330 Ω one? Well, don’t worry: even the most experienced engineers mess up at soldering sometimes, and there’s a way to fix your circuit when it happens. In these cases, you need to <em>desolder</em>, which just means to remove the solder from a solder joint.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><em>Solder wick</em> is a very useful tool for desoldering, and I suggest keeping some at your side any time you solder. The solder wick is made of braids of copper thread, so it’s also called <em>desoldering braid</em>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0125-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">When you place a piece of solder wick on top of a solder joint and heat both together, the solder should melt as usual, and the solder wick should absorb the liquid solder just as a dry cloth absorbs water. When you remove the solder wick, the solder should be on the wick instead of on the circuit board!</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec04"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_126"/><span class="black1">PROJECT #13: DESOLDER THE BATTERY CLIP</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Knowing how to desolder is very useful, and not just for fixing soldering mistakes.

<p class="indent">In <a class="white" href="ch07.xhtml#ch07">Chapter 7</a>, I’ll introduce you to the transistor, the photoresistor, and the potentiometer. These are some really exciting components that you can use to make your circuit come alive and respond to its surroundings. For example, I’ll show you how to create a circuit that tells you when the sun rises in the morning!</p>&#13;

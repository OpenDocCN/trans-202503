<p class="GlossaryTerm">Abbreviation cipher</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A method that replaces each word of a text with its first letter or a different abbreviation of it.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">American Cryptogram Association (ACA)</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting the hobby and art of codebreaking. The ACA publishes a bimonthly newsletter titled <em>The Cryptogram</em>.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Aristocrat</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A simple substitution cipher where word divisions and punctuation are retained.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">ASCII code</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">The acronym for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. ASCII is a standardized way of representing letters, numbers, and punctuation in binary digits, which are the zeros and ones that computers can understand. For example, the lowercase letter <em>a</em> is encoded as 01100001, and a capital <em>A</em> is encoded as 01000001. We can also represent these values in hexadecimal (base 16) for easier reading, such that <em>a</em> is 61 and <em>A</em> is 41. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_396" title="396"/>Though ASCII is called a code, it is not really encryption; it is just a table of values, as is Morse code.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Baudot code</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">Another “table of values” system that is used primarily with teletypes/teleprinters and represents each character using a series of five bits. Using it, operators could punch holes into paper tape for each letter and rapidly feed rolls of the tape into any teletype, which would then convert the Baudot code into human-readable messages.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Caesar cipher</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A cipher, created in Roman times, that shifts every letter in the alphabet by a fixed number of characters (originally three). Examples: <code class="bold">A</code><span class="MenuArrow">▶</span><code>D</code>, <code class="bold">B</code><span class="MenuArrow">▶</span><code>E</code>, <code class="bold">C</code><span class="MenuArrow">▶</span><code>F</code>, <code class="bold">D</code><span class="MenuArrow">▶</span><code>G</code> . . . Some sample ciphertext: <code>Pxvlfdo jurxs idprxv iru Olhjh dqg Olhi</code>.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Cipher</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">An encryption method that works on letters or letter groups. A properly constructed cipher system can encrypt any kind of plaintext because it works on the individual letters. For comparison, <em>see</em> Code.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Ciphertext</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">The result of an encryption.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Cleartext</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">An unencrypted text, specifically one that may be visible in an otherwise encrypted text that has unencrypted parts showing through. <em>See also</em> Plaintext.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Code</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">An encryption method that works on words or phrases. Codes generally involve codebooks with predefined words or word groups to be encrypted. Codes cannot easily be used to encrypt any random message. <em>See</em> Cipher.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Codebreaking</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">Another word for cryptanalysis. Note that the word <em>codebreaking</em> refers to the breaking of all kinds of encryption, including both ciphers and codes.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Codegroup</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">The number, letter group, or symbol that represents a word in a code. In a nomenclator, a codegroup may also represent a number, letter, or other character.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Columnar transposition</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A transposition cipher that typically requires the plaintext to be written in lines of equal length and the columns to be shuffled. The ciphertext is then read column-wise. Usually, a keyword is used to carry out a columnar transposition. See <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapters 9 and 10">Chapters 9 and 10</span> for the difference between complete and incomplete columnar transposition.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_397" title="397"/>Crib</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A word or phrase that a codebreaker knows or suspects to be in the plaintext. When breaking a cryptogram, it is usually helpful to know or guess a word that appears in the plaintext.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Cryptanalysis</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">In general, the craft of decoding a ciphertext without knowing the key. Also referred to as breaking (or trying to break) a cryptogram. Note that some cryptanalysts might also review an encryption system or analyze a message to determine the system being used without trying to recover the original message.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Cryptogram</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">An encrypted message (i.e., a ciphertext) that a codebreaker is trying to break.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Cryptography</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">The science of encrypting a message. From the Greek <em>kryptos</em> and <em>graphein</em>, meaning “hidden writing.”</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Cryptology</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">The entirety of the study of <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_cryptography">cryptography</span> and <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_cryptanalysis">cryptanalysis</span>.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">CrypTool</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">An open source project that develops a set of free software programs implementing over 400 encryption and codebreaking methods. These programs are CrypTool 1, CrypTool 2, JCrypTool (a Java-based tool), and CrypTool-Online. For the codebreaking tasks in this book, we mainly used CrypTool 2.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">DCT</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition"><em>See</em> double columnar transposition.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Decipher</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">To break a cipher, meaning to perform a successful cryptanalysis on it. Deciphering may be targeted at determining the key without determining the plaintext.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Decryption</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">The process performed by the intended recipient of a ciphertext. Decryption requires knowledge of the encryption method used and (usually) the key. Decryption should be contrasted with deciphering or breaking (also known as solving or cryptanalyzing) an encrypted message, which means that the key and/or the encryption method are not known.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Digraph</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A group of two letters (for instance, <em>SJ</em>, <em>IA</em>, <em>BD</em>, or <em>GG</em>). Also known as a bigram or a digram.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_398" title="398"/>Digraph substitution</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A substitution cipher that replaces letter pairs (digraphs). The Playfair cipher is by far the most popular method of this kind.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Double columnar transposition (DCT)</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">An encryption method that consists of two consecutive columnar transpositions in a row. Considered one of the best manual ciphers.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Dunin-Schmeh substitution</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A substitution cipher that is often used to encrypt and hide metapuzzles in crypto books. Provides a level of security similar to double ROT-13 and the Duran-Fairport cipher. Often uses a Sheahan 1802 key. Example: <code>Ptmqt jetoq cforq wlqcl updkr tfbcq ylktt fbcqa loqyq ltfbc qaloq yqwlb jqmiu pqwlx</code>.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Enigma</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A German encryption machine that is about the size of a typewriter and was used in World War II. Polish, French, and British cryptanalysts, along with other intelligence operatives, collaborated to break its cipher systems.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Exclusive-or (XOR) operation</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A type of binary arithmetic in which a set of ones and zeros is added to another. The result, or sum, is considered to be 0 if both values are the same and 1 if they are different. For example, if 1111 is XORed with 0000, the result is 1111. If 1111 is XORed with 0010, the result is 1101. And if 1010 is XORed with 1110, the result is 0100. In cryptography, letters in words are sometimes converted to ASCII and XORed with the 1s and 0s of a predetermined key. The resulting binary stream is then transmitted to a receiver, who XORs them back to the original plaintext. If the binary key is random, we call this a Vernam cipher or a special case of a one-time pad.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Freemason’s cipher</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition"><em>See</em> Pigpen cipher.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Frequency analysis</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">The act of determining the frequency of letters in a message. An important tool for a codebreaker.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Heptagraph</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A group of seven letters.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Hexagraph</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A group of six letters.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Homophones</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">Multiple ciphertext letters or characters that stand for the same plaintext letter. <em>See</em> Homophonic cipher.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_399" title="399"/>Homophonic cipher</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A cipher that includes homophones. The user of a homophonic substitution can choose between several alternatives when encoding a certain letter.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Index of coincidence (IC)</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">The probability that two randomly chosen letters from a text are the same. An important analysis tool for a codebreaker.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Key</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">Some secret information that only the sender and receiver should know. In practice, most encryption methods have a key, though in some situations, knowledge of the method is the key. The intended recipient should be capable of easily decrypting a message if they know the key, whereas a third party should not be able to decipher a ciphertext without the key. (Note: Some simple systems, such as Aristocrats, can result in the ability to extract the plaintext without recovering the full key.)</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Keyword</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A representation of many keys (e.g., <code class="bold">BIRDHOUSE</code>) that is easier to memorize than, for instance, a number (e.g., <code class="bold">844708615</code>) or large table.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Manual cipher</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">An encryption method that can be applied with paper and pencil or simple cipher tools, as opposed to requiring the help of a complex cipher machine or computer.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Morse code</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A system of dots and dashes or short pulses and long pulses that was developed to communicate messages via telegraph or radio. Though called a code, it is not an encryption system but a method of communication. (See <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Appendix D">Appendix D</span> for a Morse code table.)</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Nomenclator</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">An encryption method that combines a simple substitution or a homophonic cipher with a code. A nomenclator provides one or more numbers, letter groups, or symbols for each letter of the alphabet and for frequent words. This system is sometimes also called a nomenclature.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Null</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A meaningless symbol included in a ciphertext for the purpose of confusing codebreakers. An integral part of many substitution ciphers, codes, and nomenclators.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Octagraph</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A group of eight letters.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_400" title="400"/>One-time pad</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A substitution cipher that adds a random sequence (the key) to the plaintext. If used properly, meaning if the key is not guessable and only used once, a one-time pad is unbreakable. However, using a one-time pad requires large amounts of key material, which makes it impractical for many applications.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Patristocrat</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A simple substitution cipher in which word divisions and punctuation are removed.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Pentagraph</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A group of five letters. The most frequent pentagraph in the English language is <em>OFTHE</em>.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Pigpen cipher</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A simple substitution cipher that replaces each letter of the alphabet with a symbol taken from a Tic-Tac-Toe-like grid. Also known as the Freemason’s cipher, as it became very popular among Freemasons in the eighteenth century. There are many variants of it. Here is one example:</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="114" src="image_fi/502727b03/gc001.png" width="469"/></figure>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Plaintext</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A message to be encrypted. Different from cleartext, which is unencrypted text that appears in an otherwise encrypted message.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Playfair cipher</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">An encryption method that replaces digraphs with other digraphs. Based on a square table and a number of simple substitution rules.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Polyalphabetic cipher</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A substitution cipher based on several substitution tables. The application of each table follows some rule (for instance, table 1 might encrypt the first letter, table 2 might encrypt the second letter, etc.). A table can be constructed with a simple method, such as shifting each alphabet with a Caesar cipher.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">ROT-13</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A Caesar cipher that swaps each letter for the letter thirteen places away from it in a twenty-six-letter alphabet. The advantage of ROT-13 is that each letter, if encrypted twice, returns to its original form.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Shorthand</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A writing method that increases the speed and brevity of writing. Sometimes used for (low-level) encryption.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_401" title="401"/>Simple substitution</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">An encryption method based on a fixed, one-to-one substitution table. The Caesar cipher is one type of simple substitution cipher, though the cipher alphabet can also be keyed or random.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Steganography</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">The science of hiding information. Common steganographic methods include sympathetic (chemically reactive) ink, marked letters, word initials spelling out a message, and various digital systems that hide messages in the bits and bytes of some other file. While cryptography makes a message unreadable, steganography hides its very existence. Not to be confused with stenography.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Stenography</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">Another word for shorthand.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Substitution cipher</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">An encryption method that substitutes letters or letter groups, as opposed to a transposition cipher, which encrypts things by scrambling them.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Super-encryption</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">An encryption performed on a message that is already encrypted. Super-encryption is often used to enhance the security of a code. These methods are sometimes very simple; for instance, adding the current day of the month can cause a comparable shift to each letter of a message. See JN-25 in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 7">Chapter 7</span>.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Tetragraph</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A group of four letters, also known as a tetragram or a quadgram. The most frequent tetragraph in the English language is <em>TION</em>.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Transposition cipher</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">An encryption method that changes the order of the letters in a message. There are numerous transposition cipher variants, the most popular of which are turning grille ciphers and columnar transpositions.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Trigraph</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A group of three letters, also known as a trigram. The most frequent trigraph of the English language is <em>THE</em>.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Turning grille</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">An encryption tool that consists of a square stencil with various holes cut into it. To encrypt a message, one turns the stencil by ninety degrees four times and writes letters in the holes at each orientation.</p>
<p class="GlossaryTerm">Vigenère cipher</p>
<p class="GlossaryDefinition">A polyalphabetic substitution system once considered the “chiffre indéchiffrable,” or the uncrackable cipher. Today, it is often solved quite quickly with modern codebreaking techniques.</p>

We begin by looking at Blender’s render settings, both for Blender Internal and Cycles, to determine how to get the best render in the shortest time possible. Following that discussion, I’ll cover using Blender’s node-based compositor to further refine, adjust, and grade these renders into final images. Finally, we’ll make a few tweaks to the renders in GIMP.</p><div class="sect1" title="The Render Tab"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="render_tab">The Render Tab</h2></div></div></div><p>We touched on the Render tab of the Properties editor when we used it to bake textures in <a class="xref" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Texture Baking">Chapter 10</a>. In this chapter, we’ll examine the other settings available in this tab. Many of these depend on which renderer is being used—Blender Internal or Cycles—so we will look at each in turn.</p><div class="sect2" title="Rendering with Blender Internal"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="rendering_with_blender_internal">Rendering with Blender Internal</h3></div></div></div><p>The Render tab in Blender Internal is shown in <a class="xref" href="ch14.html#render_tab_of_the_properties_editorcomma" title="Figure 14-1. The Render tab of the Properties editor, shown here in Blender Internal">Figure 14-1</a>.

At the top of the panel, the Layer selector lets you select the render layer to work on. Use the checkboxes on the right to enable or disable rendering particular layers; use the + and <span class="strong"><strong>–</strong></span> buttons on the right to add or delete render layers.</p><p title="Name"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Name</strong></span></strong></span>. This allows you to name the selected layer.</p><p title="Scene/Layer/Mask Layer"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Scene/Layer/Mask Layer</strong></span></strong></span>. These three sets of checkboxes let you choose which scene layers are used in your final renders and how. Enabling a layer under Scene turns the layer on in the 3D Viewport (just as the layers checkboxes in the 3D viewport header do). Layers must be checked under Scene to be renderable. Enable layers under Layer to make them render for the currently selected render layer; you can have multiple layers turned on under Scene, but only those checked under Layer will be rendered. Layers checked under Mask (but not under Layer) will mask out geometry on other layers, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch14.html#using_layers_as_mask_layersdot_here_the" title="Figure 14-2. Using layers as mask layers. Here the monkey object is placed on layer 2, with everything else on layer 1. On the left, both layers are checked under Layer, and everything renders as expected.

This pass then contains only that data that can be used in compositing the final image. For example, you could use the <span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span>-depth pass as the input for a Defocus node to create depth of field, or you could use an ambient occlusion pass to add extra shadows to an image. Use the checkboxes under Passes to enable or disable various passes. Some passes can be excluded from the main render pass by toggling the camera icon to the right of the pass’s name.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Dimensions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="dimensions">Dimensions</h4></div></div></div><p>This panel lets you set the dimensions in time (frames) and space (resolution) of your render or <a id="iddle1028" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1056" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1069" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1204" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1251" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1318" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1730" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1861" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1914" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2187" class="indexterm"/>animation. The Resolution settings let you choose the size of your final render, while the Frame Range settings are used to specify the number of frames in your animation.

To do so, switch to the camera view in the 3D Viewport (<span class="smaller">NUMPAD</span> 0). Then press <span class="smaller">SHIFT</span>-B and drag out a rectangle over the area you wish to restrict the render to. This will automatically enable the Border setting.

Left: No anti-aliasing. Right: Anti-aliasing turned on with the number of subsamples set to 8.">Figure 14-3</a>). Aliasing is often most obvious on the outlines of objects or shadows, but it can also crop up in textures or specular highlights. Anti-aliasing addresses this problem by taking multiple subsamples of each pixel with slightly different offsets and blending them, resulting in a smoother-looking boundary, as you can see in the figure.</p><div class="figure"><a id="anti-aliasing_reduces_the_appearance_of"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00307"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538856.png.jpg" alt="Anti-aliasing reduces the appearance of jagged edges in renders.

Left: No anti-aliasing. Right: Anti-aliasing turned on with the number of subsamples set to 8.</div></div><p>Use the numbers on the left of the Anti-Aliasing panel to determine how many samples will be taken (more samples will result in smoother renders but longer render times). The drop-down menu on the right sets the type of filter used to blend the samples: The default of Mitchell-Netravali gives good results without taking too much sharpness out of the render, but when working with higher-resolution images, try Gaussian. Use the Full Sample option to make Blender maintain each sample separately, even during compositing, which can help with aliasing issues at the compositing stage.</p><p>Sampled motion blur is similar to anti-aliasing in that multiple samples are taken per pixel but at different times rather than different locations. This results in motion blur for fast-moving objects once <a id="iddle1070" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1091" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1191" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1292" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1411" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1432" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2028" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2070" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2099" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2100" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2174" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2176" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2304" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2344" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2417" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2431" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2557" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2564" class="indexterm"/>the samples are blended together. (Essentially, the image is rendered multiple times, and the results are blended.) The number of samples is determined by the Motion Samples setting, and the amount of time in frames over which the samples are taken is determined by the Shutter setting.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Shading"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="shading">Shading</h4></div></div></div><p>The Shading panel lets you turn on and off different rendering options, including Textures, Shadows, Subsurface Scattering, Environment Mapping, and Ray-Tracing options. To speed up renders, turn off unneeded shading options.</p><p>The Alpha drop-down menu lets you choose how to render the background of your image. Sky renders the sky colors and textures set in your global settings. The Straight Alpha and Premultiplied options render the background of your image as transparent. In the case of Premultiplied, the RGB values of transparent or partially transparent pixels are multiplied by the alpha value on output. This method of encoding alpha values is also referred to as <span class="emphasis"><em>associated alpha</em></span> and is required for some image formats, like TIFF and PNG. It’s also useful for compositing because combining images this way gives better results, though Blender’s compositor has tools for working with both premultiplied and unpremultiplied alpha. Straight Alpha skips this step and renders unassociated alpha images instead.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="ch14note01"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>If the above discussion on different methods of encoding alpha values seems complex, it’s because it is. I’ve covered it only very briefly here, but it’s actually a pretty deep topic. For more information, try searching <span class="italicAlt"><a class="ulink" href="http://www.blender.org/" target="_top">http://www.blender.org/</a></span> and the Blender wiki for Color Management.</em></span></p></div></div><div class="sect3" title="Performance"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="performance">Performance</h4></div></div></div><p>The Performance panel contains a number of options that can affect how fast Blender will render and how much impact rendering will have on your computer’s resources. Blender splits up images to be rendered into multiple tiles, which are then rendered individually. The most important settings are Threads and Tiles. When set to Fixed, these settings let you specify how many tiles will be rendered at once (up to twice the number of processor cores you have).</p><p>The Tiles settings determine how the image to be rendered is broken up into tiles along the <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>- and <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span>-axes. Tiles are rendered one at a time per thread, meaning that if you have eight threads, you will be able to render eight tiles simultaneously.</p><p>Tweaking the Tiles settings can make a big difference in your render times. Using too few tiles can mean that processor threads are left idle once all available tiles are being rendered, even if there is plenty of your image left to be rendered. Using too many tiles uses more memory without speeding up the render. The optimum number of tiles is generally between 16 (4×4) and 64 (8×8), with more complex scenes benefiting from more tiles.</p><p>The other settings in this panel are even more technical and can usually be left at their defaults. For more on these settings, try <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://wiki.blender.org/" target="_top">http://wiki.blender.org/</a></em></span>.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Post-Processing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="post-processing">Post-Processing</h4></div></div></div><p>The Post-Processing settings determine the postprocessing effects applied to your image. The relevant ones are the checkboxes that turn on Compositing and the Sequencer (Compositing should be turned on). Dither adds subtle variation to the colors of pixels, preventing color banding in images with smooth gradients. The Edge setting draws cartoon lines around an image’s geometry, with the strength of the line effect determined by the Threshold setting and the color of the lines determined by the color selector directly below the Threshold setting.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Stamp"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="stamp">Stamp</h4></div></div></div><p>The Stamp settings let you stamp your image with data about the render, such as the time it was rendered, the filename, the frame number, and so on. Stamp is often useful when rendering animations, but it’s not of much use to us for our projects.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Output"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="output">Output</h4></div></div></div><p>The Output settings determine where the output of your renders is saved and in what format. Animation frames are saved automatically, but single-frame images must be saved manually. The default output directory (<span class="emphasis"><em>/tmp/</em></span> on Mac and Linux systems or the Temp folder on Windows) determines where animation frames are saved, but you can change this to a directory of your choosing. The output format is determined by the drop-down menu, which includes options for what color information to save (black and white, RGB, or RGB and alpha).</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Bake"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="bake">Bake</h4></div></div></div><p>These settings are discussed in detail in <a class="xref" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Texture Painting">Chapter 11</a>.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Rendering with Cycles"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="rendering_with_cycles">Rendering with Cycles</h3></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1205" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1236" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1245" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1349" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1470" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1512" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1521" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1655" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1750" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1838" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1945" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2055" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2065" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2111" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2177" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2226" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2319" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2589" class="indexterm"/>Many of the Render tab options remain the same in Cycles, so I will just cover the important differences here.</p><div class="sect3" title="Sampling"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="sampling">Sampling</h4></div></div></div><p>The Sampling panel determines how many samples to calculate for each pixel in the image, which is the main way Cycles determines the quality and noisiness of your final image. The Render and Preview options determine how many samples to render for each pixel in an image before terminating the render. (Use Render for proper renders and Preview for the Cycles preview in the 3D Viewport.) More passes will result in less noise, but the number of passes required to get a noise-free image will vary widely according to the contents of your scene. Seed sets a random value for Cycles to use for sampling, and different seeds will produce different noise patterns.</p><p>You can use the Clamp option to prevent <span class="emphasis"><em>fireflies</em></span>, which are overly bright pixels caused by noise from bright lights or specular highlights. To do so, set the maximum brightness (the <span class="emphasis"><em>clamp</em></span> value) for a sample to a nonzero number (a value of around 3 works well). This keeps overly bright samples from throwing off the average value of a pixel too much, though it comes at the cost of some accuracy in rendering. (If you leave this at the default of 0, this feature will not be used.)</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Light Paths"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="light_paths">Light Paths</h4></div></div></div><p>The Light Paths panel supplements the options in the Samples panel, allowing you to go deeper into how Cycles renders your scene. Specifically the Light Paths panel lets you determine what types of rays to render and how many bounces to calculate before terminating a ray. More bounces give more accurate (and slightly brighter) renders, at the cost of extra render time.</p><p>The Transparency, Light Paths, and Bounce settings define the maximum number of light bounces that Cycles will calculate for each type of interaction with light. The Max setting sets the overall maximum number of bounces, while the other settings restrict specific types of rays to fewer bounces. The Min setting for Transparency and Overall Bounces enables early termination of refracted rays, resulting in faster rendering with the loss of some accuracy.</p><p>The No Caustics and Shadows options let you turn on and off caustics and ray-traced shadows to speed up rendering. Caustics are rays that have been reflected or refracted by glossy surfaces that then contribute to diffuse illumination. Examples include the bright patterns of sunlight in a swimming pool and light focused by a magnifying glass onto a surface.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Film"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="film">Film</h4></div></div></div><p>You can use the Film panel’s Exposure setting to change the exposure of your render to either brighten or darken scenes overall. (However, it’s best to change the settings on your lamps instead for finer control.) The Transparency checkbox determines whether your background renders as transparent or uses your global settings. The drop-down menu on the right sets the pixel filter type (with the width of the filter below it). Smaller widths produce sharper-looking edges but can cause aliasing. Larger widths give smoother renders at the expense of a small amount of blurring.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Layers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="layers-id00028">Layers</h4></div></div></div><p>Cycles works much the same as Blender Internal when it comes to layers, but it supplies a different range of passes. Cycles will split up each kind of light ray (diffuse, glossy, and transmission) into separate passes and can split up those passes further into direct and indirect passes. These features can be useful when compositing.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Balancing Render Time and Quality"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="balancing_render_time_and_quality">Balancing Render Time and Quality</h2></div></div></div><p>When rendering any CG scene, the aim is to get the nicest render possible in the shortest amount of time. This can be tricky given the number of variables you can change, all of which affect how long an image will take to render. Still, there are some general principles.</p><p title="Start simple and be organized."><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Start simple and be organized.</strong></span></strong></span> Organize your objects onto layers to make it easier to render different aspects of the scene. Also, make sure you don’t have any unneeded objects in your scene on visible layers when rendering.</p><p title="Experiment."><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Experiment.</strong></span></strong></span> If your renders are slow, try changing one setting at a time to see what most affects your render times. For example, change a render setting or the number of samples on a lamp. Or enable or disable some aspect of a material, such as subsurface scattering or ray-traced reflections. Changing one thing at a time will let you see exactly what makes the most difference, <a id="iddle1111" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1127" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1128" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1287" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1300" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1764" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2178" class="indexterm"/>whereas changing multiple settings forces you to guess which one altered your render time. If you find that something in particular is slowing down your renders without contributing much to the final image, get rid of it.</p><p title="Minimize surplus geometry."><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Minimize surplus geometry.</strong></span></strong></span> Once you have the camera angle that you want, start getting rid of objects that won’t be seen in your render by deleting them or temporarily shifting them to other layers. This will reduce the amount of geometry Blender has to keep track of when rendering and will speed up your renders! This trick is often helpful when working with environments.</p><p title="Simplify lighting."><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Simplify lighting.</strong></span></strong></span> Try to simplify the settings on your lamps and see whether you can eliminate some. In particular, look at the shadow settings: Will a smaller shadow-buffer resolution really make much difference, or does a ray-traced lamp need quite so many samples?</p><p>As you become more familiar with Blender, you’ll soon learn which settings impact render time for different aspects of scenes. In the meantime, the time you spend experimenting and simplifying your scene will almost always speed up render times.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="The Compositor"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="compositor">The Compositor</h2></div></div></div><p>You’ve pressed F12 to render, and your image is finished, right? Not quite. Now it’s time to post-process the final renders using Blender’s compositor and GIMP. Blender’s compositor is node based and uses the Node editor (which we explored in <a class="xref" href="ch12.html#editing_node_materials" title="Editing Node Materials">Editing Node Materials</a>). In this section, I’ll show you how to use the compositor to apply effects such as depth of field, bloom, and color grading and to combine separate render layers into one final image (see <a class="xref" href="ch14.html#default_node_tree_for_blenderapostrophes" title="Figure 14-5. The default node tree for Blender’s compositor is pretty basic. Whatever you connect to the sockets of the Composite node will become the final output of your render.">Figure 14-5</a>). I’ll also show you how to use GIMP for painting and touch-up.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Rendering and Compositing the Bat Creature"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="rendering_and_compositing_the_bat_creatu">Rendering and Compositing the Bat Creature</h2></div></div></div><p>I wanted to show the final Bat Creature on a dark background with a little color grading. To facilitate this, I split the rendering into two layers: one for the fur and one for the rest of the body. I planned to create a simple, dark-colored background in the compositor with a slight vignette to darken the corners and keep the focus on the bat.</p><div class="sect2" title="Render Layers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="render_layers">Render Layers</h3></div></div></div><p>As the first step toward splitting the Bat Creature into two <span class="emphasis"><em>render layers</em></span>, I split my scene into four <span class="emphasis"><em>scene layers</em></span>. On (scene) layer 1, I placed the body (with Subdivision Surface and Displace modifiers) and the teeth and nails. On layer 2, I placed the eye objects, along with the Hemi light I created to light just the eyes (using the This Layer Only option for the lamp). On layer 3, I placed the duplicated body that I had used to create the hair (with Emitter turned off in the Render panel of the Particles tab so that only the hair rendered). Finally, on layer 4, I placed my lamps, the camera, and my floor plane.</p><p>Next, I set up two render layers. On the first, I disabled Strand under the Include settings of the Layers panel. For the other, I disabled Solid so that normal meshes wouldn’t be rendered while my strand hair would. I named the first layer <span class="emphasis"><em>body</em></span> and the second <span class="emphasis"><em>strand</em></span>.</p><p>For the body layer, I enabled an ambient occlusion pass under Passes in the Layers panel. The result when rendered was two separate layers, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch14.html#two_render_passes_for_the_bat_creature" title="Figure 14-4. The two render passes for the Bat Creature">Figure 14-4</a>. When looking at the render (choose <span class="strong"><strong>Render Result</strong></span> from the image selector drop-down menu), you can switch between these layers using the drop-down menu in the header of the UV Image editor.</p><p>In the Layers panel, the options and settings you choose apply only to the currently selected render layer. In other panels of the Render tab, options apply across all render layers. I set the Alpha option in the Shading panel to Straight Alpha and turned off Ray Tracing to speed up renders.

Because each node is processed in the order it is connected, changing the order in which you apply nodes to your image can make a big difference. To begin compositing, make sure that Use Nodes is enabled and that you are editing the compositing nodes (not a material or texture).

I used the ambient occlusion pass (from the socket labeled AO) as the second input.</p><p>To increase the effect, I darkened the ambient occlusion pass with a Curves node before multiplying it with the image. To do so, I added an RGB Curves node and inserted it between the ambient occlusion output of the Render Layer node and the Multiply node. To do this quickly, drag the node over the connection between two other nodes (you should see the connection highlight) and release it to insert it in a chain between the other two nodes.</p><p>Finally, I made the curve on the RGB Curves node a bit steeper (see <a class="xref" href="ch14.html#adding_extra_ambient_occlusion_to_the_bo" title="Figure 14-6. Adding extra ambient occlusion to the body render layer with a Multiply node.

The real-world effect arises from imperfections in lenses, but I could mimic this by blurring my image and overlaying it on the original input.</p><p>To generate bloom, I created a Blur node (<span class="smaller">SHIFT</span>-A▸Filter▸Blur) and set its type to Fast Gaussian. I also enabled the Relative option, which would allow me to specify the blur radius relative to the width of the image. This option is useful if you don’t know what final resolution you want to use for your render, because the amount of blurring won’t appear to change if you make the render smaller or larger. (It would if you defined the radius in pixels.)</p><p>I set the <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> radii to 2 percent and selected <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span> under Aspect Correction to make sure the blur had the correct aspect ratio. (This applies only when using relative blur.) Then, I used an Add node with a factor of 0.2 to subtly add the result of the blurred image on top of the original.</p><p>The initial effect was too bright, so I used another RGB Curves node to darken the darker regions of the image before it was blurred so that only the brightest regions would contribute to the bloom. The resulting node tree is shown in <a class="xref" href="ch14.html#my_bloom_effect_and_the_node_tree_respon" title="Figure 14-7. My bloom effect and the node tree responsible.

This node is really useful for applying a range of color-grading effects to your renders. First, I added the Color Balance node. Then, I connected my composite-in-progress to its image input and turned the factor down to 0.6. (The Color Balance node can produce a strong effect, so turning the factor down is an easy way to make it more subtle without having to make very small adjustments to the other controls.)</p><div class="figure"><a id="my_bloom_effect_and_the_node_tree_respon"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00311"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538864.png.jpg" alt="My bloom effect and the node tree responsible.

You can set each input by using the color wheel to control the hue and saturation and using the vertical slider to control the color. The color you select is shown below in the color picker. You can also click the color picker to use Blender’s default color picker or to set RGB or HSV values manually.</p><p>The Color Balance node inputs are named <span class="emphasis"><em>lift</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>gamma</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>gain</em></span>, and they can be thought of as affecting the shadows, midtones, and highlights of an image. Thus, to give an image less prominent highlights, you could turn down the brightness of the lift input. To give it saturated red highlights, you could set the gain color toward red. In general, setting opposing colors for the lift and gain inputs often results in an image with nice color harmonies between the lights and darks.</p><p>In many Hollywood movies, the shadows are teal or blue, while the midtones and highlights are pushed toward orange—a color scheme that works well with the pinkish-orange of most lighter skin tones. For the Bat Creature, I opted for a slightly blue lift color and a slightly yellow gain color. The effect is shown in <a class="xref" href="ch14.html#adding_color_grading_to_the_render_of_th" title="Figure 14-8. Adding color grading to the render of the Bat Creature. Left: Before grading.

To create this effect, I took the alpha channel of my body layer and ran it thought a lens distortion filter with a distort value of 1. This distorted the image into a circular shape with black corners, which was almost what I needed.</p><p>Then, I used a Blur node set to Fast Gaussian Blur with a relative radius of 50 percent to blur the output of the Lens Distortion node. This gave the image a soft gradient out from the middle, which I then overlaid onto the color-corrected render.</p><p>Finally, I added a Sharpen node with a very low Factor setting (around 0.05) to the end of the node tree and connected the output to the Composite node. The final node tree is shown in <a class="xref" href="ch14.html#compositing_node_tree_for_the_bat_creatu" title="Figure 14-9. The compositing node tree for the Bat Creature">Figure 14-9</a>, and the result is shown in <a class="xref" href="ch14.html#composited_output_for_the_bat_creature" title="Figure 14-10. The composited output for the Bat Creature">Figure 14-10</a>.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Compositing Feedback and Viewer Nodes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="compositing_feedback_and_viewer_nodes">Compositing Feedback and Viewer Nodes</h3></div></div></div><p>Creating a final composite from your renders can be a long process that requires some experimentation.

The other way is to use Cycles’s “real” depth of field as a Camera setting when rendering.</p><p>To use real depth of field, do the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Select the active camera.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In the Depth of Field panel on the Object Data tab of the Properties editor, set a distance from the camera to the <span class="emphasis"><em>focal plane</em></span> (the distance where objects appear in focus).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a id="iddle1090" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1200" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1279" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1289" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1691" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2179" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2227" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2228" class="indexterm"/>Set an aperture size to determine the amount of blurring.

This causes the camera to ignore the Manual Depth setting and focus on the object’s center instead. It’s usually easiest to create an empty object, place it where you want the scene to be in focus, and then set this empty object as the depth-of-field target in the Camera settings.</p><p>To better visualize the depth-of-field distance, enable the Limits option in the Display panel of the Camera settings.

Again, I added an RGB Curves node before the Blur node to increase the contrast and slightly darken the image to be blurred.</p><p>For color grading, I added a Color Balance node: I chose a purplish color for the Lift Color and a greenish tint for the Gain.

Then, I opened the image in GIMP. To create a background for the top right-hand corner, I opened a sky texture from CGTextures as a layer (see <a class="xref" href="ch14.html#creating_a_background_for_the_jungle_tem" title="Figure 14-17. Creating a background for the Jungle Temple in GIMP, using an early, noisy render as a guide. The background was made with the same dimensions as the final image, but only the corner showing the sky is shown here. (The rest of the background image was black.) The render (on a separate layer) was hidden before saving the background.">Figure 14-17</a>) and put it below the render in my layer stack. I then scaled and positioned the background to put a nice bit of cloud in the top corner (as you can see in the first image in <a class="xref" href="ch14.html#creating_a_background_for_the_jungle_tem" title="Figure 14-17. Creating a background for the Jungle Temple in GIMP, using an early, noisy render as a guide. The background was made with the same dimensions as the final image, but only the corner showing the sky is shown here. (The rest of the background image was black.) The render (on a separate layer) was hidden before saving the background.">Figure 14-17</a>). To create a nighttime background, I used the Curves tool to really darken the clouds layer, while using the Hue-Saturation and Brightness tools (Colors▸Hue-Saturation) to reduce the saturation of the layer a bit so that the colors didn’t look too saturated.</p><p>Next, I added some embellishments to the cloud image using the Dodge/Burn tool (set to Dodge) and added highlights to the edges of some clouds using a soft-edged brush. I also created a new transparent layer and set its Blend mode to Overlay. I then used this new layer to incorporate some extra colors around the clouds: a light blue around the edges of the leaves on the temple and some greens and yellows toward the corner. Throughout, my goal was to end up with a background that had a color palette similar to that of my rendered image.</p><p>Finally, I hid the render layer, saved the background on its own as an <span class="emphasis"><em>.xcf</em></span> file (<span class="smaller">CTRL</span>-S) so that I could edit it later, and exported it as a <span class="emphasis"><em>.tga</em></span> image (<span class="smaller">CTRL</span>-E).

First, I had to add my background behind my render. To do so, I used the Alpha Over node with the background as the first input and my render as the second (see <a class="xref" href="ch14.html#compositing_the_background_in_gimp_with" title="Figure 14-18. Compositing the background in GIMP with an Alpha Over node.

When adding depth of field to the Spider Bot, I used physically correct, rendered depth of field. However, for the Jungle Scene, I used the compositor’s Defocus node. This method gives slightly less accurate results than rendered depth of field, but it allows for more control over which areas are blurred and which are not and lets us change the focus <span class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> we finish rendering, which gives us more flexibility.</p><p>The Defocus node requires two inputs: the image to be blurred and a black-and-white mask that determines how much to blur different parts of the image. For the mask, you can use either the <span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span>-buffer directly (check the <span class="strong"><strong>Use z-buffer input</strong></span> checkbox), or you can use any black-and-white image as a simple mask by leaving it unchecked. If you choose to use the <span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span>-buffer directly, Blender will use the camera’s depth-of-field settings found in the Object Data tab of the Properties editor. Regions closer or farther than the depth-of-field distance will be blurred. If you turn this option off, Blender will use the value of the input to determine the amount of blurring so that white regions will be the most blurred and black the least.</p><p>For the Jungle Temple scene, I opted to use the <span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span>-buffer directly, but I added a Blur node (with a radius of 6 pixels) between the <span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span>-buffer output and the <span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span>-input of the Defocus node to blur these values slightly. This method reduces the creation of artifacts on foreground objects, where objects that should be blurred appear to have sharp edges.</p><div class="figure"><a id="adding_depth_of_field_and_bloom_to_the_c"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00323"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538888.png.jpg" alt="Adding depth of field and bloom to the composite"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 14-19. Adding depth of field and bloom to the composite</div></div></div><div class="sect3" title="Adding Bloom and Vignetting"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="adding_bloom_and_vignetting">Adding Bloom and Vignetting</h4></div></div></div><p>Next, I added some bloom. As with the other projects, I blurred the image and combined it back over the image with an Add Mix node. I applied some vignetting by taking the alpha channel of the render, distorting it with the Lens Distortion node, blurring it with the Blur node, and then overlaying this on top of the image. The nodes for these stages are shown in <a class="xref" href="ch14.html#adding_depth_of_field_and_bloom_to_the_c" title="Figure 14-19. Adding depth of field and bloom to the composite">Figure 14-19</a>.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Color Grading"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="color_grading">Color Grading</h4></div></div></div><p>To add color grading, I used two different nodes. First, I put the image through a Hue Correct node, which let me adjust the saturation (or hue or value) of specific colors within the image. Because I wanted to play up the oranges and greens before applying some extra grading, I adjusted the curve of the Hue Correct node by clicking the curve and dragging to add a new point, raising the profile of the curve in the orange and green areas, and lowering it slightly in the blues. This increased the saturation of the orange light from the temple entrance and the green of the leaves, making them more prominent. I ran the result through a Color Balance node, adding some blues to the shadows with a bluish lift color and some yellow and orange to the midtones and highlights with very slightly orange gamma and gain colors.</p><p>Finally, I added a Filter node at the end of the node tree, just before the Composite output node. I set this to Sharpen with a factor of 0.05 to add some very slight sharpening to the image.</p><p>This completes the compositing for the Jungle Temple scene. The complete node setup is shown in <a class="xref" href="ch14.html#node_tree_for_compositing_the_jungle_tem" title="Figure 14-20. The node tree for compositing the Jungle Temple, organized with frame nodes">Figure 14-20</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="node_tree_for_compositing_the_jungle_tem"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00324"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538890.png.jpg" alt="The node tree for compositing the Jungle Temple, organized with frame nodes"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 14-20. The node tree for compositing the Jungle Temple, organized with frame nodes</div></div><p><a id="iddle1953" class="indexterm"/>As a final adjustment, I opened the composite image in GIMP and cleaned up one or two remaining depth-of-field artifacts by hand with the Blur tool. I also cropped the image slightly to improve the composition. The result is shown in <a class="xref" href="ch14.html#final_result_for_the_jungle_temple" title="Figure 14-21. The final result for the Jungle Temple">Figure 14-21</a>.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="In Review"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="in_review-id00029">In Review</h2></div></div></div><p>This more or less completes each of the projects I set out to create for the book. In this chapter, I took the final scenes and rendered them using either Cycles or Blender Internal as render engines. Then I took the render output and used GIMP and Blender’s compositor to tweak and refine these results into my final images. The result is renders of the projects that I can now call finished.</p><p>Of course, there’s always another tweak that can be made, and in <a class="xref" href="ch15.html" title="Chapter 15. Going Further">Chapter 15</a>, we’ll look at a few more things that could be done with these projects to take them further.</p><div class="figure"><a id="final_result_for_the_jungle_temple"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00325"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538892.png.jpg" alt="The final result for the Jungle Temple"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 14-21. The final result for the Jungle Temple</div></div></div></section></body></html>

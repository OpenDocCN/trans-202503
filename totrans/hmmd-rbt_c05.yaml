- en: As you likely guessed from the name, Wobbler is a bot that moves around by wobbling
    back and forth. While it might seem a little clumsy initially, don’t let first
    impressions fool you. Wobbler is an enthusiastic and persistent little bot ready
    to take on the world.

- en: The parts for this project are all easy to find, and the Wobbler should be straightforward
    to put together, even for less-experienced bot builders. More-experienced bot
    builders will have some fun modifying this one, as the design’s simplicity leaves
    a lot of room for expansion and experimentation.

- en: You’ll build Wobbler in stages. First, you need to have premodified the continuous-rotation
    servo motors for direct drive (Chapter 4) or sourced one of the geared motor alternatives
    as outlined in Appendix A. Once that’s complete, you’ll mark and drill the plastic
    box to mount the motors, attach the motors inside the box, and wire up the circuit.
    Finally, you’ll mount Wobbler’s oval “wheels” on the outside of the box.

    to the motor shaft that spins.)

    back to back. The servo shafts where the horns used to be should be located near
    the bottom of the plastic container and a little off-center to help Wobbler wobble.

    motor. Connect the paired wires with one of the wires from the battery holder.
    Next, connect together the remaining three loose wires to form another grouping.
    You can either solder these wires or use a mechanical connector.![f05007](image_fi/500235c05/f05007.png)

    trim off the hook part with diagonal cutting pliers or a small saw. You’ll be
    left with self-adhesive oval wheels.

- en: Step 9. Peel off the adhesive backing and stick the wheels to the servo horns
    such that each horn is completely hidden behind its wheel. Make sure to stick
    the wheels so they’re very off-center from the axis of rotation to give the bot
    a good wobble.![f05010](image_fi/500235c05/f05010.png)

    moves. Also try replacing the coat hook “wheels” with other objects to get unique
    results. Simply attach different objects to the servo horn with double-sided tape
    or zip ties.

<p class="noindentb">Shell scripts are an efficient way to interact with your machine and manage your files and system operations. With just a few lines of code, your computer will do exactly what you want it to do. But you can also use shell scripts for many other essential (and not-so-essential) tasks.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentb">This second edition of <em>Wicked Cool Shell Scripts</em> offers a collection of useful, customizable, and fun shell scripts for solving common problems and personalizing your computing environment. Each chapter contains ready-to-use scripts and explanations of how they work, why you’d want to use them, and suggestions for changing and expanding them. You’ll find a mix of classic favorites, like a disk backup utility that keeps your files safe when your system crashes, a password manager, a weather tracker, and several games, as well as 23 brand-new scripts, including:</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• A ZIP code lookup tool that reports the city and state</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• A Bitcoin address information retriever</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• A suite of tools for working with cloud services like Dropbox and iCloud</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• Tools for renaming and applying commands to files in bulk</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• Image processing and editing tools</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Whether you want to save time managing your system or just find new ways to goof off, these scripts are wicked cool!</p>&#13;

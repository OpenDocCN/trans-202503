<p class="BodyFirst"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_66" title="66"/>The world’s most famous unsolved cryptogram, the Voynich manuscript, is a 230-page document in the Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library at Yale University in Connecticut. From cover to cover, this probably 600-year-old, handwritten book is filled with incomprehensible text. The writing looks like a simple substitution cipher with spaces of the different-alphabet type, and the plaintext appears to have been written in an unknown language (but could also be an ordinary text written in a lost writing system, or completely meaningless nonsense). We will revisit the Voynich manuscript at the end of this chapter.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the postcard in <a href="#figure5-1" id="figureanchor5-1">Figure 5-1</a> (provided to us by Richard SantaColoma), which was sent in 1912.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c05-endnote-1" id="c05-noteref-1">1</a></sup> Because at least 90% of the encrypted postcards we have seen are encrypted with a simple substitution cipher, we can assume that we are dealing with one here. In addition, the sender used a nonstandard alphabet, which is also typical for a simple substitution cipher.</p>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure5-1">Figure 5-1</a>: The plaintext of this 1912 encrypted postcard is in Portuguese.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It is unlikely, however, that this postcard was written in English. As the card bears a Portuguese stamp and was sent to a woman with a Portuguese surname living in Portugal, we can guess that the plaintext is written in Portuguese.</p>
<p>We can try to solve this postcard with the codebreaking methods discussed in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapters 2">Chapters <a href="c02.xhtml">2</a></span> through <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_4"><a href="c04.xhtml">4</a></span>; however, we must adapt our word guessing, frequency analysis, and word pattern searches to the Portuguese language.</p>
<p>You don’t speak Portuguese? Don’t hesitate to try breaking this message anyway. Experience shows that breaking an encrypted message does not necessarily require command of the language used. Letter frequencies and other information about non-English languages are available in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Appendix B">Appendix B</span> and on numerous web pages.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Identifying the postcard’s likely language was not very difficult. However, things are not always that simple. In fact, detecting a cryptogram’s plaintext language may be a major challenge, which is why it is always a good idea to learn an item’s context. Before examining a ciphertext, figure out where it comes from and which languages its author spoke.</p>
<p>We can also apply statistical techniques to detect the language of a cryptogram. Take a look at the postcard reproduced in <a href="#figure5-2" id="figureanchor5-2">Figure 5-2</a>, which was written in 1906 and provided to us by Tobias Schrödel.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c05-endnote-2" id="c05-noteref-2">2</a></sup> Again, the nonstandard alphabet makes a simple substitution cipher very likely. The spaces between the words are indicated by commas.</p>

<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_68" title="68"/>Which language might have been used? The postcard itself, just like the stamp, is Russian. The recipient, a certain Inkeri Wink, lived in Vaasa, Finland. The main language spoken there is Finnish, but Swedish is also common. Other Scandinavian and Baltic languages are encountered in Finland as well. The surname Wink could be English or German. Let’s start our analysis, as usual, with a transcript (provided to us by Thomas Bosbach):</p>

<p>Frequency analysis might help us once again. Here are the letter frequencies of the postcard message:</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="173" src="image_fi/502727c05/g05003.png" width="653"/></figure>
<p>How well do these frequencies match the five languages most likely to have been used on the postcard (Finnish, Russian, Swedish, English, and German)? Here are the most frequent and the second-most frequent letters in each:</p>
<table border="1" class="TabularList" id="tabular-502727c05-0001">

<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_69" title="69"/>With respect to the most frequent letter, German is the best fit. We see that the most frequent letter in the postcard has a frequency of 14.88%, while the most frequent letter in the German alphabet has a frequency of 16%. But the second-most frequent letter in the postcard fits best with Finnish (13.02% and 11%). Here are a few more statistical indicators that may help detect the language (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Appendix B">Appendix B</span> for more information):</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>No one-letter word appears in the cryptogram. This is consistent with German and Finnish, which do not have one-letter words either. As there are one-letter words in English, Swedish, and Russian, these languages are therefore less likely candidates.</li>
<li>The average word length in the postcard message is 5.0 letters. This fits best with German (6.0 letters) and Swedish (6.0). The average word lengths of English, Russian, and Finnish are 6.2, 6.6, and 7.6.</li>
<li>If we have a computer available, we can compute the index of coincidence of the cryptogram (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Appendix B">Appendix B</span>). The result is 7.2%. Here are the relevant comparison values for the index of coincidence in other languages: Finnish: 7.0%, Russian: 5.3%, English: 6.7%, Swedish: 6.8%, and German: 7.3%. German again delivers the best match.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we look at the alphabet the sender used, we note something else interesting: this character set contains two letters . . .</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="76" src="image_fi/502727c05/g05004.png" width="184"/></figure>
<p class="BodyContinued">. . . that each bear two dots at the top in some (but not all) cases. We have transcribed these letters using <code>E</code> and <code>O</code>; the dots are also present in the transcript. Dots like these sometimes appear on the letters <em>A</em>, <em>O</em>, and <em>U</em> in certain languages, as with <em>Ä</em>, <em>Ö</em>, and <em>Ü</em>. These dots are called umlauts. Finnish, Swedish, and German (among others) have umlauts, but English doesn’t. In the Russian alphabet, only one double-dotted letter exists.</p>
<p>As can be seen, German is the best fit with respect to the most frequent letter, the average word length, and the index of coincidence. In addition, German has umlauts, and there are no one-letter words in the German language. Overall, German is by far the most likely language used on the postcard. Considering that this message was sent from Russia to Finland, this is certainly a surprise!</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Now that we have guessed the postcard message’s language, we can apply the methods we covered in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 3"><a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a></span> by adapting these techniques to the German language.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502727c05-0001"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_70" title="70"/><a class="XrefDestination" id="Frequencyanalysisandwordguessing"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-502727c05-005"/>Frequency analysis and word guessing</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Frequency analysis is even more effective in German than in English, as the most frequent letter (<em>E</em>) is easier to distinguish from the others due to the larger margin between it and the second-most frequent letter: <em>E</em> has a frequency of 16%, followed by <em>N</em> with 10% (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Appendix B">Appendix B</span>). The most frequent German digraphs (letter pairs) are <em>EN</em> and <em>ER</em>.</p>
<p>On this postcard, <code>B</code> is the most frequent letter and therefore probably stands for <code class="bold">E</code>, while <code>D</code> (the second-most frequent) might represent <code class="bold">N</code>. These guesses are confirmed by the fact that <code>BD</code> is the most frequent letter pair in the ciphertext, which is consistent with <em>EN</em> being the most frequent German digraph.</p>
<p>Good words to search for in a German text are the commonly used indefinite articles <em>EIN</em>, <em>EINE</em>, <em>EINEN</em>, <em>EINER</em>, and <em>EINES</em>. These are helpful for a codebreaker because they appear often, consist of frequent letters, and (with the exception of <em>EIN</em>) contain letter repetitions. (<em>EINEN</em> even contains two.) In fact, the word <code>BCDBD</code> in the third-to-last line of the transcript is easily identified as <code class="bold">EINEN</code>. Knowing this, we can guess that the first word in the letter, <code>ABCDB</code>, is <code class="bold">MEINE</code> (<code class="bold">my</code> in English). With some basic knowledge of German, the rest can be solved as well.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Another way to decipher this postcard is to search for words with rare letter patterns. The CrypTool 2 software supports this technique for many languages, including German. So, our next step might be to check the ciphertext for a word with many letter repetitions. <code>JNÖHMNCHI</code>, which has the pattern 123452647, looks like a good candidate. At first glance, CrypTool 2 delivers disappointing results, as it gives us twenty-six different matches for this pattern (<a href="#figure5-3" id="figureanchor5-3">Figure 5-3</a>). Even if we discard words such as <code class="bold">PIPELINES</code>, <code class="bold">MACULATURE</code>, and <code class="bold">GOLDBONDS</code>, which are not very likely to appear on a 1906 postcard, we are left with many choices.</p>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure5-3">Figure 5-3</a>: CrypTool 2 can be used to search for word patterns in many different languages.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="BodyContinued"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_71" title="71"/>However, one word stands out: <code class="bold">GLÜCKLICH</code>, which means “happy.” First, this word seems a good fit for a postcard that apparently contains a love message. And second, if we look at the following word . . .</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="52" src="image_fi/502727c05/g05005.png" width="187"/></figure>
<p class="BodyContinued">. . . (transcribed as <code>JNÖHMNCHI</code>), we see that the third letter has two dots on it (i.e., it has an umlaut, provided that our assumption with respect to umlauts is correct). The word <code class="bold">GLÜCKLICH</code> has an umlaut at the third position, as well.</p>
<p>Having identified <code class="bold">GLÜCKLICH</code>, we have seven letters we can use to guess the rest of the text:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>Plaintext:       </code><code class="bold">I    CHG  KLU</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>Ciphertext:    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRST</code></p>
<p>With a basic knowledge of German, it is not very difficult to guess more words. For instance, we already know that the middle three letters of the ciphertext word <code>DCHIR</code> stand for <code class="bold">*ICH*</code>. This expression can be identified as the common word <code class="bold">NICHT</code> (<code class="bold">not</code>).</p>
<p>If you don’t speak German, you can boost the process by combining the word pattern search with frequency analysis. The seven letters we know (<code class="bold">I</code>, <code class="bold">C</code>, <code class="bold">H</code>, <code class="bold">G</code>, <code class="bold">K</code>, <code class="bold">L</code>, <code class="bold">U</code>), along with the assumption that <code>B</code> stands for <code class="bold">E</code> (because it’s the most frequent letter) and <code>D</code> stands for <code class="bold">N</code> (because it’s the second-most frequent), go a long way. Next, look for the indefinite articles <em>EIN</em>, <em>EINE</em>, <em>EINEN</em>, <em>EINER</em>, <em>EINES</em>, and <em>EINES</em>, as described above. With over ten letters identified, the rest of the codebreaking job should be easy.</p>
<p>This key recovers the following plaintext:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>MEINE GUTE MAUS</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>DEINEN LIEBEN SCHÖNEN</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>BRIEF BEKOMMEN. DANK</code></p>

<p class="BodyFirst">The ciphertext depicted in <a href="#figure5-4" id="figureanchor5-4">Figure 5-4</a> is described in one of the books Klaus often recommends, the 1922 <em>Cryptography</em> by André Langie (1871–1961).<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c05-endnote-3" id="c05-noteref-3">3</a></sup> According to Langie, a wealthy man found this encrypted note in his son’s textbook. Wondering why his offspring wrote or received such a message, he asked crypto-specialist Langie to break it.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="" class="" height="438" src="image_fi/502727c05/f05004.png" width="694"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure5-4">Figure 5-4</a>: A wealthy man found this message in a textbook of his son’s. (The numbers were added later by a cryptanalyst.)</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Langie saw that the encryption system was a variant of the pigpen cipher. The note also included spaces and punctuation marks between the words, which always makes guessing the words considerably easier. As you can see, symbols 1–42 are enclosed between quotation marks, and there is a colon after symbol 20. The most frequently occurring character is symbol 7, which is repeated nine times.</p>
<p>Langie first tried to determine the plaintext language. Because the story about the man and his son took place in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, French was the most likely option. However, the word starting at symbol 43 begins with a double letter, which hardly ever happens in a French text. Langie then assumed that the plaintext might be written <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_73" title="73"/>in Spanish, a language spoken by the client’s son. The only double letter encountered at the beginning of Spanish words is <em>L</em> (for instance, in <em>llevar</em> or <em>llamarse</em>).</p>
<p>If this assumption were correct, symbol 45, the most frequent one in the cryptogram, is likely to be an <code class="bold">A</code> or an <code class="bold">E</code> (in Spanish, a double <em>L</em> is always followed by a vowel, and <em>A</em> and <em>E</em> are frequent letters). The two letters <code class="bold">L</code> and <code class="bold">A</code>/<code class="bold">E</code> occur again at the end of the last word of the text, but in reverse order. This is a five-letter word whose first letter is the same as the third, so it must be <code class="bold">PAPEL</code> (<code class="bold">paper</code>).</p>
<p>Knowing the letters <code class="bold">A</code>, <code class="bold">E</code>, <code class="bold">L</code>, and <code class="bold">P</code>, Langie could easily guess a few more. He finally derived the following substitution diagram. In this elegant system, the alphabet is drawn from left to right, one grid at a time:</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="114" src="image_fi/502727c05/g05006.png" width="383"/></figure>

<p>After some trial and error, Thomas found that the first line (<code>ABCD:ACEB!</code>) stands for <code class="bold">LIEB LENI</code>. <code class="bold">LIEB</code> means “dear,” while <code class="bold">LENI</code> is a common abbreviation of the female name Helene. Knowing five letters, Thomas could then guess the rest of the message. The plaintext turned out to be a sweet love letter. This is not surprising, as most encrypted postcards appear to have been sent by young men (and sometimes young women) to their lovers:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>LIEB LENI,</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code> </code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>ÜBER DEINEN LIEBEN BRIEF SEHR GEFREUT. DU WUNDE(R)ST DICH ÜBER MEINE POESIE. DEIN SCHATZ MUSS ALLES KÖNNEN DAMIT DU MIT SEINEN LEISTUNGEN ZUFRIEDEN BIST.

<p>Substituting some names (Leneken is another nickname for Helene, Änne is a female name, and Fritze is the name of the sender), we can derive a translation:</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">The 1783 book <em>Natürliche Magie</em> (<em>Natural Magic</em>) by German author Christlieb Benedict Funk (1736–1786) is unusual for its time in that it expresses a high degree of skepticism concerning psychic phenomena.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c05-endnote-10" id="c05-noteref-10">10</a></sup> It debunks all kinds of allegedly supernatural activities, such as fortune-telling, dousing, and astrology, in a way that is similar to how James Randi, Michael Shermer, and other skeptics have unmasked these practices in modern times.</p>
<p>One chapter of <em>Natürliche Magie</em> covers people who break encrypted texts while pretending that their ability involves supernatural powers, rather than frequency analysis and word guessing. As a challenge for his readers, Funk introduces the cryptogram in <a href="#figure5-9" id="figureanchor5-9">Figure 5-9</a>. We leave it to the reader to decipher it with either conventional or psychic codebreaking techniques.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Numerous unsolved cryptograms look like simple substitution ciphertexts and are unlikely to have English plaintexts. In the following sections, we introduce a few.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502727c05-0010"><a class="XrefDestination" id="TheVoynichmanuscript"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-502727c05-017"/>The Voynich manuscript</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">One of the most famous unsolved cryptograms in the world, the centuries-old Voynich manuscript is a handwritten collection of unknown text and cryptic illustrations. The manuscript is named after book dealer Wilfrid Voynich (1865–1930), who reportedly purchased it in 1912 from an Italian Jesuit college. Today, the manuscript is owned by the Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library at Yale University in Connecticut, where it is known as Beinecke MS 408.</p>
<p>The manuscript uses an alphabet that consists of approximately twenty-five symbols. Through radiocarbon analysis, the vellum (calfskin) it is written upon was dated to the early fifteenth century. Hundreds of experts and generations of hobbyist researchers have examined the manuscript in great detail, but their main questions remain unanswered. We do not know where, when, and by whom it was written, despite the radiocarbon dating. The purpose of the manuscript is also unclear. Theories have proposed that it is an herbal or religious text, an alchemical tome, or a sales catalog for medicinal ointments. Forgery and fraud have been suggested, as well. The plants depicted cannot be identified with certainty, and most look like mere fantasy images, containing no clear relationship to any specific place, time, religion, or ideology.</p>
<p>Over the last several decades, at least sixty alleged solutions to the Voynich manuscript have been published, but none have been accepted by experts. Naturally, researchers have applied to the text all codebreaking methods described in our book, including frequency analysis, word guessing, and the index of coincidence, to no avail. It is also unclear in which language the plaintext was written (if in any at all). People have argued in favor of Italian, Latin, Greek, English, German, and many others.</p>
<p>Klaus has compiled an extensive list of other encrypted books on his website. Elonka encouraged him to formalize the list, and it is now formally known as “Klaus Schmeh’s Encrypted Books List,” or EBL for short. Grouping the 125-odd books (and counting!) into categories, sorted by quantity, Klaus came up with the following:<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c05-endnote-11" id="c05-noteref-11">11</a></sup></p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Diaries</li>
<li>Secret society books</li>
<li>Knowledge books</li>
<li>Literature</li>
<li>Puzzle books</li>
<li>Art books</li>
<li>Hoaxes</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_81" title="81"/>Religious books</li>
<li>Notebooks</li>
<li>Unable to categorize</li>
</ul>
<p>After examining the traits of each category and then comparing those traits with the Voynich manuscript (<a href="#figure5-10" id="figureanchor5-10">Figure 5-10</a>), our conclusion is that, provided that the manuscript was not created by someone who was mentally ill, it is most likely either a book of knowledge or a hoax.</p>

<p>In the internet age, when the Voynich manuscript’s mysterious images have become available to a wider audience, an already thriving subculture of Voynichologists has grown even larger. A Voynich manuscript conference held in Italy in 2012 attracted scores of researchers, including both authors of this book.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c05-endnote-12" id="c05-noteref-12">12</a></sup> Another (virtual) conference was held ten years later, on the island of Malta, where the authors presented a new paper outlining their categorization findings.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c05-endnote-13" id="c05-noteref-13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>There are many websites dedicated to the manuscript, and the most comprehensive is operated by René Zandbergen (<a class="LinkURL" href="https://voynich.nu">https://voynich.nu</a>). Moreover, the text has inspired many books<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c05-endnote-14" id="c05-noteref-14">14</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c05-endnote-15" id="c05-noteref-15">15</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c05-endnote-16" id="c05-noteref-16">16</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c05-endnote-17" id="c05-noteref-17">17</a></sup> and the discussion forums at <a class="LinkURL" href="https://voynich.ninja">https://voynich.ninja</a> and <a class="LinkURL" href="https://voynich.net">https://voynich.net</a>. The latter is operated by Richard SantaColoma, who also maintains a Voynich manuscript mailing list. Whoever finally provides an accepted decipherment of the manuscript will be considered one of the greatest codebreakers ever.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">In 2017, we were contacted by the owner of an antique cigarette case that bears an encrypted inscription (see <a href="#figure5-11" id="figureanchor5-11">Figure 5-11</a>).<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c05-endnote-18" id="c05-noteref-18">18</a></sup> This message looks like <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_82" title="82"/>an ordinary simple substitution cipher of the different-alphabet type—which any good cryptanalyst can usually decipher easily. Klaus shared this cryptogram with his online community of avid codebreakers, but surprisingly, nobody came up with a solution.</p>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure5-11">Figure 5-11</a>: This inscription on a German cigarette case has yet to be deciphered. On the front side, the letters <em>AS</em> are engraved (upper left).</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The cigarette case cryptogram consists of four encrypted lines. Below the text is a date written in a standard German format (dd.mm.yyyy), dated 24 December, 1909. This suggests that the case was a Christmas present. (Gifts are typically exchanged on December 24 in Germany.) The owner said it had been in his family for generations. He inherited it from his father but did not know much about its origin. His ancestry mainly stems from ancient Thuringia (Thüringen), now a region in central Germany, and his family has always spoken German. A symbol on the front side of the case depicts the letters <em>AS</em>. These are probably the initials of the original owner.</p>
<p>The cigarette case cryptogram is a relative newcomer among the most famous unsolved ciphertexts. If you are an ambitious codebreaker, you might choose to study this crypto mystery.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Though the first three NSA Monday Challenges are not terribly difficult (all are simple substitution cipher cryptograms that were solved within a day), the fourth one, released on May 26, 2014, proved to be a different matter:<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c05-endnote-19" id="c05-noteref-19">19</a></sup></p>

<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_83" title="83"/>The letter frequencies and the index of coincidence (6.7%) are consistent with a simple substitution cipher. (Remember that the English index of coincidence is 6.7%.) Nevertheless, to our knowledge, the solution is still unknown.</p>
<p>As with all unsolved challenges, it is difficult to say for certain which type of system was used or what the plaintext language is. However, we are including this one in our non-English substitution chapter, as we think it’s a good possibility that the plaintext is not in English. Of course, we may be wrong!</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Moustier, a district of the small town of Frasnes-lez-Anvaing in eastern Belgium, is the home of an unsolved crypto mystery: the two encrypted altar inscriptions in St Martin’s church (see <a href="#figure5-12" id="figureanchor5-12">Figure 5-12</a>).<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c05-endnote-20" id="c05-noteref-20">20</a></sup> The Moustier altar inscriptions became known to crypto history enthusiasts when, in 2013, the NSA declassified 136 editions of its internal newsletter <em>Cryptolog</em>. When British crypto-researcher Nick Pelling read through these publications, he found an article from 1974 introducing the cryptograms.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c05-endnote-21" id="c05-noteref-21">21</a></sup> He had never heard of them before, and he wrote about them in his blog <em>Cipher Mysteries</em> to inform the codebreaking community of his find.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c05-endnote-22" id="c05-noteref-22">22</a></sup></p>

<p>The first Moustier cryptogram is on the church’s St Martin’s Altar, the second on its Virgin’s Altar. These altars, including the encrypted inscriptions, were probably built in the first half of the nineteenth century, but we do not know who created these messages or what intentions the creator had. Compared to other crypto mysteries, such as the Dorabella cryptogram and the Zodiac Killer messages, the Moustier altar inscriptions have received considerably less attention from cipher experts. They are still unsolved.</p>

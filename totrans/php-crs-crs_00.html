<p class="INTRO">PHP is one of the engines that drive the internet: it plays a role both in what the user sees on web pages and in what happens behind the scenes, such as processing form submissions, talking to other websites, and interacting with databases. The language was first released in 1995, but it wasn’t until the late 2000s, when my computing students encouraged me to introduce PHP into their web programming classes, that I began working with it in earnest. They wanted to improve their skill profiles for the job market, since they felt the internet was going to continue to grow in importance in the work of computing. Clearly, they were right.</p>

<p class="TNI1"><i>PHP Crash Course</i> is for anyone wanting to learn PHP programming in a practical, hands-on way, regardless of whether you have previous programming experience. Since most PHP programs are web applications, knowing about the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) languages used to represent the content and visual style of web pages might prove helpful, but you don’t need to know any web programming, such as JavaScript.</p>

<h2 class="H1" id="sec2"><span id="toc-link_2"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Why PHP?</span></h2>
<p class="TNI1">PHP is currently in its eighth major version, so as well as being tried and tested, it’s faster and more secure than ever before. It’s a free, open source, and well-maintained language. While other popular web programming languages are available, about 70 percent of the web is run by PHP programs, including Etsy, Facebook (using its dialect of PHP, called Hack), Spotify, Wikipedia, and WordPress.</p>
<p class="TX">PHP also has a relatively shallow learning curve. We’ll start off with just a few lines of code, and once you’re comfortable with the basics, we’ll move on to larger, more structured web application systems.</p>

<p class="NOTE-TXT"><i>The original version of the language was released as Personal Home Page Tools (PHP Tools). These days, however, PHP is a recursive acronym that stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.</i></p>

<p class="noindent">I wrote this book to teach you how to think about and design data structures and algorithms. On our way, we studied many durable ideas from computer science. Hash tables free us from expensive linear searches. Trees organize hierarchical data. Recursion solves problems whose solutions involve solving subproblems. Memoization and dynamic programming keep recursion fast even when subproblems overlap. Graphs generalize what is representable by trees. Breadth-first search and Dijkstra’s algorithm find shortest paths in graphs; since graphs are so general, “paths” can mean many things. Binary search turns a “solve this” problem into a “check this” problem. Heaps make it fast to find minimum or maximum elements; segment trees do similarly for other kinds of queries. Union-find speeds up graph problems that maintain equivalent sets of nodes. Randomization makes it easier to design fast algorithms and protects us from worst-case test cases. That’s quite the list, and I hope you’re pleased with what you’ve learned. I also hope that I’ve helped you dig into why these data structures and algorithms are useful, why they work so well, and what we can learn from their design.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_404"/>I wrote this book to motivate you to think about and design data structures and algorithms. I used programming problems that I hope you found intriguing (so that you’d want to solve them) and challenging (so that you’d have to learn how to solve them). Perhaps you’re motivated by the problems themselves. Perhaps you’re motivated by the ways that computer scientists pose and solve problems. Perhaps you’re itching to solve problems that are personally meaningful to you. Whatever the case, I hope that I’ve helped you develop your skills and motivation to pursue what matters.</p>
<p class="indent">One nice thing about programming problems like those in this book is that they wait patiently for us to solve them. They don’t change. They don’t adapt—but we do. When we’re stuck on a problem, we can go away, learn new things, and come back to try again. Real-world problems certainly aren’t going to present to us their precise inputs and outputs. Some of their features may change over time. It’s up to us to find out in what ways these problems wait patiently, too.</p>
<p class="indent">I wrote this book to teach. Thank you for trusting me and making time to read through what I had to say.</p>

<p class="noindent">Before my first visit to China, I was convinced that Akihabara in Tokyo was the go-to place for the latest electronics, knickknacks, and components. That changed in January 2007, when I first set eyes on the SEG Electronics Market in Shenzhen. SEG is eight floors of all the components a hardware addict could ever want, and only later did I learn that it’s just the tip of the Hua Qiang electronics district iceberg.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As the lead hardware engineer at Chumby at the time, I was in China with then-CEO Steve Tomlin to figure out how to make chumbys (an open source, Wi-Fi-enabled content delivery device) cheaply and on time. With prices like those at SEG, we were definitely in the right country to make at least the first part of that mission a success.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_8"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f0008-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>Shenzhen’s SEG Electronics Market, the new electronics mecca. Akihabara, eat your heart out!</em></p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec1"><strong>THE ULTIMATE ELECTRONIC COMPONENT FLEA MARKET</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">When I first stepped into the SEG building, I was assaulted by a whirlwind of electronic components: tapes and reels of resistors and capacitors, ICs of every type, inductors, relays, pogo pin test points, voltmeters, and trays of memory chips. As a total newcomer to manufacturing in volume, I was blown away by everything I saw at SEG.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_9"/>All of those parts were crammed into tiny six-by-three-foot booths, each with a storekeeper poking away at a laptop. Some storekeepers played <em>Go</em>, and some counted parts. Some booths were true mom-and-pop shops, with mothers tending to babies and kids playing in the aisles.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0009-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>A couple of family-run component shops</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_10"/>Other booths were professional setups with uniformed staff, and these worked like a bar—complete with stools—for electronic components.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0010-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>A swanky professional parts seller</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">No one at SEG says, “Oh, you can get 10 of these LEDs or a couple of these relays,” like you might hear in Akihabara. No, no. These booths specialize, and if you see a component you like, you can usually buy several tubes, trays, or reels of it; you can get enough to go into production the next day.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Looking around the market, I saw a woman sorting stacks of 1GB mini-SD cards like poker chips. A man was putting sticks of 1GB Kingston memory into retail packages, and next to him, a girl was counting resistors.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_11"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f0011-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>The bottom-left corner of this display was packed with all kinds of SD cards.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Another booth had stacks of power supplies, varistors, batteries, and ROM programmers, and yet another had chips of every variety: Atmel, Intel, Broadcom, Samsung, Yamaha, Sony, AMD, Fujitsu, and more. Some chips were clearly ripped out of used equipment and remarked, some of them in brand-new laser-marked OEM packaging.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0011-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>The sheer quantity of chips for sale at a single booth at SEG was incredible.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_12"/>I saw chips that I could never buy in the United States, reels of rare ceramic capacitors that I could only dream about at night. My senses tingled; my head spun. I couldn’t suppress a smile of anticipation as I walked around the next corner to see shops stacked floor to ceiling with probably 100 million resistors and capacitors.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0012-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>Reels and reels of components, in every shop window</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Sony CCD and CMOS camera elements! I couldn’t buy those in the United States if I pulled teeth out of the sales reps. (Some sellers even have the datasheets behind the counter; always ask.) Next, I spotted a stack of Micrel regulator chips, followed by a Blackfin DSP chip for sale. Nearby, a lady counted 256Mb DRAM chips—trays of 108 components, stacked 20 high, in perhaps 10 rows.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_13"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f0013-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>The equivalent of Digi-Key’s entire stock of DRAM chips sat right in front of me!</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">And across from her were a half-dozen more little shops packed with chips just like hers. At one shop, a man stood proudly over a tray of 4Gb NAND flash chips. All of this was available for a little haggling, a bit of cash, and a hasty good-bye.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0013-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>A close look at a tray of 4GB flash chips</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_14"/>And that’s just the first two floors of SEG. There are six more floors of computer components, systems, laptops, motherboards, digital cameras, security cameras, thumb drives, mice, video cameras, high-end graphics cards, flat-panel displays, shredders, lamps, projectors—you name it. On weekends, “booth babes” dressed in outrageous Acer-branded glittery bodysuits loiter around, trying to pull you in to buy their wares. This market has all the energy of a year-round CES meets Computex, except instead of just showing off the latest technology, the point is getting you into these booths to buy that hardware. Trade shows always feel like a bit of a strip tease, with your breath making ghostly rings on the glass as you hover over the unobtainable wares underneath.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">But SEG is no strip tease. It’s the orgy of consumer and industrial electronic purchasing, where you can get your grubby paws on every piece of equipment for enough <em>kuai</em><a href="footnote.xhtml#fn1" id="fn_1">*</a> out of your wallet. Between the smell, the bustle, and the hustle, SEG is the ultimate electronic component flea market. It’s as if DigiKey went mad and let monkeys into its Minnesota warehouse, and the resulting chaos spilled into a flea market in China.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Of course, a lot of the parts I marveled at in 2007 are antiques now. For example, 4Gb flash chips are trash, and 1GB flash disks are old news. At the time, however, those things were a big deal, and SEG is still the best place to get the latest tech in bulk.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec2"><strong>THE NEXT TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Three blocks down the street from SEG lay the Shenzhen Bookstore.<sup><a href="footnote.xhtml#fn2" id="fn_2">†</a></sup> The first and most visible rack was a foreign book section, packed with classics like Stanford University professor Thomas Lee’s <em>The Design of CMOS Radio-Frequency Integrated <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_15"/>Circuits</em> and several titles by UCLA professor Behzad Razavi. I picked up Lee’s book, and it cost 68 kuai, or $8.50 USD. Holy cow! Jin Au Kong’s book on Maxwell’s equations? $5. Jin Au Kong <em>taught</em> me Maxwell’s equations at MIT.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I went on a spree, packing my bag with six or seven titles, probably around $700 worth of books if I’d bought them in the United States. At the checkout counter, I bought them for less than $35, complete with the supplemental CDs, saving about $665. That’s equivalent to buying an economy-class ticket to Hong Kong!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In China, knowledge is cheap. Components are cheap. The knowledge in the books at the Shenzhen Bookstore was the Real Deal, the parts to use that knowledge are down the street at SEG, and within an hour’s drive north are probably 200 factories that can take any electronics idea and pump it out by the literal boatload. These are no backward factories, either. With my own eyes, I saw name-brand, 1,550-nanometer, single-mode, long-haul, fiber-optic transceivers being built and tested there. Shenzhen is fertile ground, and you need to see it to understand it.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Shenzhen has the pregnant feel of the swapfests in Silicon Valley back in the ’80s, when all the big companies were just being founded and starting up, except magnified by 25 years of progress in Moore’s law and the speed of information flow via the internet. In this city of 12 million people, most are involved in tech or manufacturing, many are learning English, and all of them are willing to work hard.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">There has to be a Jobs and Wozniak there somewhere, quietly building the next revolution. But I’m a part of Shenzhen, too, and I still tremble in my boots with terror and excitement at the thought of being part of that revolution. This is my story, starting with that eye-opening trip to Shenzhen for Chumby.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec3"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_16"/><strong>TOURING FACTORIES WITH CHUMBY</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">In September 2006, Chumby was just a team of about a half-dozen people, and we had just given away about 200 early prototype chumby devices at FOO Camp, a conference put on by Tim O’Reilly. The devices were well received by the FOO Camp attendees, so I got the go-ahead to build the Asian supply chain.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Steve and I went to China to visit potential factories in November, but before we left, we had a trusted vendor in the United States give their best price for the job as a baseline for negotiations with the Chinese manufacturers. Then, we called up a lot of friends with experience in China and lined up about six factory tours. We hit quite a variety of places, from specialty factories as small as 500 people to mega-factories with over 40,000 people.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">There’s no substitute for going to China to tour a factory. Pictures can only tell the story framed by the photographer, and you can’t get a sense of a facility’s scale and quality without seeing it firsthand. In general, factories welcome you to take a tour, and I wouldn’t work with one that didn’t allow me to visit. However, most factories do appreciate a week’s notice, although as your relationship with them progresses, things should become more open and transparent.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Speaking of openness, Chumby’s open source nature helped the factory selection process a lot. First, we had no fears about people stealing our design (we were giving it away already), so we’d eliminated the friction of NDAs (non-disclosure agreements) when sharing critical information like the bill of materials. I think this gave us a better reception with factories in China; they seemed more willing to open up to us because we were willing to open up to them. Second, there was no question in any factory’s mind that this was a competitive situation. Anybody could and would quote and bid on our job <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_17"/>(in fact, we received a few unsolicited quotations that were quite competitive), so it saved a round of huffing and puffing.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">After reviewing several manufacturing options, Steve and I eventually decided to work with a company called PCH China Solutions. PCH itself owns only a few facilities, but it has a comprehensive network of trusted and validated vendors, primarily in China but also in Europe and the United States. Not surprisingly, the factories that PCH subcontracts to were some of the best facilities we visited in China. PCH is actually headquartered out of Ireland—thus most of their staff engineers are Irish—so there was also no language barrier for us. (PCH engineers are also hardworking, resourceful, and well trained—and, as a bonus, they always seem to know the best place to find a pint, no matter where they are. I had no idea China had so many Guinness taps!)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">There’s a lot to take in when you tour even one factory, let alone a half-dozen, and it’s easy to get overwhelmed and lost in the vagaries of electronics manufacturing. But there were some key details I found most fascinating during my factory tours for Chumby and in working with PCH to bring the chumby to life.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec4"><strong>Scale in Shenzhen</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">One stunning thing about working in China is the sheer scale of the place. I haven’t been to an auto plant in Michigan or to the Boeing plant in Seattle, but I get the sense that Shenzhen gives both a run for their money in terms of scale. In 2007, Shenzhen had 9 million people.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To give you an idea of the scale of a Shenzhen factory, the New Balance factory there employed 40,000 people and had the capacity to produce over a million shoes a month. I estimate that from raw fabric to finished shoe, the process took about 50 minutes, and every perfectly stitched bundle of plastic and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_18"/>leather was sewn by hand on an industrial sewing machine. The stations are designed so that each stage in the process takes a worker about 30 seconds.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Of course, the New Balance factory is dwarfed by Foxconn, the factory where iPods and iPhones are made.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0018-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>You know you’re big when you have your own exit off the freeway.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Foxconn is a huge facility, apparently with over 250,000 employees, and it has its own special free trade status. The entire facility is walled off, and I’ve heard you need to show your passport and clear customs to get into the facility. That’s just short of the nuclear-powered robotic dogs from the nation-corporation franchulates of Neal Stephenson’s <em>Snow Crash</em>.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec5"><strong>Feeding the Factory</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">There’s an old Chinese saying: <em>min yi shi wei tian</em>. A literal translation would be “people consider food divine” or “for people, food is next to heaven.” You can also look at it as a piece of governing advice: “the government’s mandate [synonymous <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_19"/>with heaven] is only as robust as the food on people’s plates.” Or, you can interpret it as an excuse to procrastinate: “let’s eat first [since it is as important as heaven].”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Whichever way you cut it, I think the saying still holds in China. One important metric for gauging how well a factory treats its employees is how good the food is, as it’s common for factory workers to be housed, fed, and cared for on site.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The food is actually quite good at some factories. For example, when eating with the workers at the factory that manufactured chumby circuit boards, I was served a mix of steamed fish, broiled pork, egg rolls, clean fried vegetables, and some pickled-vegetable-and-meat combo. Rice, soup, and apples were also provided in “help yourself ” quantities.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0019-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>A meal from the factory that made the chumby circuit boards</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Every facility I visited also had separate utensils and plates for guests. At one factory, my food was served on a Styrofoam plate with disposable chopsticks, while a factory worker I ate with was served food on a steel plate with steel chopsticks. I hadn’t passed the factory’s physical examination, so they gave <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_20"/>me disposable eating tools to prevent me from contaminating the factory with potential foreign diseases.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Going back to scale, some factory food operations are impressively large. I heard that Foxconn’s workers consume 3,000 pigs a day. From pigs to iPhones, it all happens right here in Shenzhen!</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0020-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>A truckload of pigs, exiting the highway toward Foxconn</em></p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec6"><strong>Dedication to Quality</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">After I started working with PCH on actually manufacturing the chumby, I ran into a situation sometime around June 2007 that showed me just how dedicated the factory workers in Shenzhen were to getting their jobs right.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I had updated the chumby motherboard to include an electret microphone, with an integral pre-amp field-effect transistor (FET). The microphone needed to be inserted in the correct orientation with respect to the circuit so the FET would receive a proper bias current.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_21"/>The first samples I got back from PCH’s factory had the microphone in backward, and I called the factory to tell them to reverse its polarity. I was going to visit the factory the next week, and I wanted to see corrected samples. When I arrived and tested the microphone, I found to my dismay that the microphones were <em>still</em> not working.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">How could that be? There are only two ways to connect a microphone.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">It turns out there were two operators on the line assembling the microphone. One soldered the red and black wires to the microphone. The next soldered these red and black wires to the circuit board. The operators were told to reverse the order, and both of them dutifully complied—giving me a microphone that was still soldered in backward, but with the color of the wires swapped. (This is actually a pretty typical story for problems in China.)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The factory was scheduled to manufacture a first pilot run of 450 circuit boards the next day. Everything had to go perfectly for Chumby’s production timeline to stay on schedule. We had soldering stencils rebuilt (we were debugging a yield issue with the QFN packaged audio CODEC as well) and ready by around noon, and by around 6 <small>PM</small>, I had the first boards in my hands to test. I ran the final factory test, and the device failed again—at the microphone. This was not a happy moment for anybody in the factory, as the factory was liable for any manufacturing defects.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I donned my smock and marched onto the line to start debugging the problem.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For the rest of the night, I remained in the factory, and so did every manager and tech involved in manufacturing the chumby. The pressure was enormous: right next to us was a line churning out 450 potentially defective circuit boards, and I was unwilling to pull the plug because I still didn’t know what the root cause was, and we had to stay on schedule.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_22"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f0022-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>I was debugging circuits at 3 AM on the day of the final factory test for the chumby</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I literally had a panel of factory workers standing by the entire night to bring me anything I needed: soldering irons, test equipment, more boards, X-ray machines, microscopes. Remarkably, not a single person hesitated; not a single person complained; not a single person lost focus on the problem. People canceled dinner plans with friends without batting an eyelash. Anyone who wasn’t needed in a particular moment was busy overseeing other aspects of the project. I hadn’t seen blind dedication like that since I worked with the autonomous underwater robotics team at MIT.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">And this went on until 3 <small>AM</small>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Embarrassingly, the problem wasn’t PCH’s fault in the end. The problem was the new firmware release I received earlier that day from the team in the United States. It had a bug that disabled the microphone due to a hack that was accidentally checked into the build tree.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_23"/>Even more impressively, when PCH found out, nobody was angry, and nobody complained. (Well, the saleswoman gave me a hard time, but I deserved it; she had been kind enough to accompany me on the production line all night long and be my translator, since my Mandarin wasn’t up to snuff.) They were simply relieved that it wasn’t their fault.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We all parted ways, and I came back into the factory the next day at 11 <small>AM</small>, after a good night’s sleep. I saw Christy, the factory’s project manager for manufacturing the chumby boards. I asked her when she came into work, and she told me she always has to report by 8 <small>AM</small>. I started to feel really bad; Christy stayed up late because of our bug, and she came in early while I slept in. I asked her why she stayed up so late even though she knew she had to report to work at 8 <small>AM</small>. She could have gone home, and we could have continued the next day.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">She just smiled and said, “It’s my job to make sure this gets done, and I want to do a good job.”</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec7"><strong>Building Technology Without Using It</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Here’s another interesting story. On our way out of the factory floor one day, Xiao Li (the quality assurance manager at the factory where we made the chumby) asked me, “What does a chumby do?” I didn’t speak Chinese very well, and she didn’t speak English very well either, so I decided to start with a few basic questions.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I asked her if she knew what the World Wide Web was. She said no.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I asked her if she knew what the internet was. She said no. I was stunned, and I didn’t know what to say. How do you describe the color blue to the blind?</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Xiao Li was an expert in building and testing computers. On some projects, she probably built PCs and booted Windows XP a hundred thousand times over and over again. (God knows <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_24"/>I heard that darn startup sound a zillion times during the microphone incident, as there was a bank of final test stations for ASUS motherboards right next to me.) But she didn’t know what the internet was.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I had assumed that if you touched a computer, you were also blessed by the bounties of the internet. All at once, I felt like a spoiled snob and a pig for forgetting that Xiao Li probably couldn’t afford a computer, much less broadband internet access. Given the opportunity, she was certainly smart enough to learn it all, but she was too busy making money that she probably sent back home to her family.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the end, the best I could do was to tell Xiao Li that the chumby was a device for playing games.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec8"><strong>Skilled Workers</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Shenzhen workers may not know a lot about everything they make, but on top of their dedication, they are highly skilled. I once watched a guy working at the same factory that sewed the chumby bags, and I swear, he could sew cosmetic cases together at a rate of 5 seconds per bag. And he wasn’t even 100 percent focused on his task; he was listening to his iPod while he sewed.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">And apparently, he wasn’t their fastest employee! They had someone about twice as fast, and he’d been with the company for about seven years. I went to watch the faster worker, but he had already gone to lunch because he’d finished everything; there were two enormous bins of finished cosmetic cases next to his workstation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_25"/>On a similar note, I was amazed to learn how rubberized tags (the ones you see all over clothes) are made in China. I always thought they were pressed by a machine, but I was wrong. All those words, colors, and letters are drawn by hand. Someone just places a logo stencil over the blank tag, paints over the stencil with amazing precision, and moves on to the next tag in their queue. When there are multiple colors, there’s a person for each color, to keep the process quick.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I asked PCH if they had any mechanized factories for stuff like that. They told me the facilities exist, but the minimum order quantity is enormous (hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions) because of the extraordinarily low cost of the product and the relatively high cost of tooling for the automated process. This is consistent with what I’ve heard about McDonald’s Happy Meal toys. They’re usually held together with screws because it’s cheaper to pay someone to screw together a toy over the whole production run than it is to make a steel injection-molding tool with the tolerances necessary for snapping the toys together.<a href="footnote.xhtml#fn3" id="fn_3">*</a></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">There was a similar trade-off inside the chumby hardware. There were four connectors on the internal chumby electronics. Using the US-based vendors that I could source, one connector had a best price of about $1 USD, and the other three had a best price of about $0.40 each. PCH’s very talented sourcing expert (her reputation was feared and respected by every vendor) managed to find me connectors that cost $0.10 and $0.06, respectively, saving almost a full $2 in cost. There’s one catch: the connectors lacked the sacrificial plastic pick-and-place pad that would enable them to be machine-assembled.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The solution? A person, of course.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_26"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f0026-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>This man hand-placed the cheaper connectors on every chumby, for about a nickel per unit. Thanks to him, chumbys were $2 cheaper, which freed up more money for us consumers to spend at Starbucks.</em></p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec9"><strong>The Need for Craftspeople</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">I’d like to introduce you to a man I know simply as Master Chao. I met him during the chumby manufacturing process, and I’m pretty sure that in your lifetime, you have used or seen something that he created.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When I went to the sample room for the factory where Master Chao worked, I was shocked at how many items on their shelf I had purchased, used, or seen in a store in the United States myself. Top-tier consumer brands manufacture their stuff in this factory, and to the best of my knowledge, the factory had just one master pattern maker at the time: Master Chao. He’s had a hand in creating cosmetic bags for Braun, accessory cases for Microsoft, and the medical braces for major brands sold in drugstores, among many other products.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_27"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f0027-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>Master Chao is the person in the foreground; in the background is Joe Perrott, Chumby’s excellent project engineer from PCH China Solutions.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Master Chao is a craftsman in the traditional sense. It used to be that the finest furniture was designed and built only with the intuition and skill of a master craftsman. Now, we all go to IKEA and get CAD-designed, supply-chain-managed, picture-book-assembly furniture kits—and despite all that, it doesn’t look too shabby. As a result, the word <em>craft</em> has been relegated to describe some scrapbook or needlepoint kit you buy at Michaels and put together on a slow weekend. We’ve forgotten that in an age before machines, “craft” was the only way anything of any quality was built.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">It turns out, however, that traditional craft still matters, because CAD tools haven’t brought about the ability to simulate our mistakes before we make them.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The creation of a <em>flat pattern</em> for textile goods is a good example of a process that requires a craftsman. A flat pattern is the set of 2D shapes used to guide the cutting of fabrics. These shapes are cut, folded, and sewn into a complex 3D <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_28"/>shape. Mapping the projection of an arbitrary 3D shape onto a 2D surface with minimal waste area between the pieces is hard enough. The fact that the material stretches and distorts, sometimes in different directions, and that sewing requires ample tolerances for good yields, makes pattern creation a difficult problem to automate.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The chumby cases added another level of complexity, because they involved sewing a piece of leather onto a soft plastic frame. In that situation, as you sew the leather on, the frame distorts slightly and stretches the leather out, creating a sewing bias dependent upon the direction and rate of sewing. This force is captured in the seams and contributes to the final shape of the case. I challenge someone to make a computer simulation tool that can accurately capture those forces and predict how a product like that will look when sewn together.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Yet, somehow, Master Chao’s proficiency in the art of pattern making enabled him to very quickly, and in very few iterations, create and tweak a pattern that compensated for all of those forces. His results, all obtained with cardboard, scissors, and pencils, were astoundingly clever and insightful. Be grateful for his old-world skills; they’ve likely played a role in the production of something you’ve used or benefited from.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec10"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_29"/><strong>Automation for Electronics Assembly</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Before my work at Chumby, I thought almost everything was made by a machine. Of course, the tours of the textile factories corrected my impression very quickly; yet high-tech stuff like electronics assembly does still tend to be heavily automated, even in China. The only exceptions I saw during my factory tours were, ironically, the lowest-cost products, such as toys. These shops were still dominated by lines of workers, stuffing and dip-soldering circuit boards by hand.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">One interesting dichotomy related to automation is the bimodal distribution of products that use <em>chip-on-board (CoB)</em> technology. CoB assembly directly bonds a silicon die to a PCB. Finished CoB assemblies have the distinctive “glob of epoxy” look to them, as opposed to the finished plastic-package look. High-end, dense electronics assemblies often employ CoB technologies. I’ve done a couple of CoB designs for some 10 Gb optical transceivers in my time, and they were not cheap.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">At the same time, however, almost all toys use CoB technology, to eliminate the cost of the IC package! It’s a testament to toy factories’ tenacity about cost reduction that they would buy an automated wire bonder and stick it next to lines molding doll heads and sewing up stuffed animals because having an in-house wire bonder saves a nickel.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A typical wire bonder bonds a wire as thin as a human hair to a site on a silicon chip not much larger than the wire diameter, and it does this several times a second. Wire bonders are very fast, precise pieces of equipment. The bonding happens so quickly that the board seems to swivel smoothly around, but in fact, it stops 16 times as it spins around, and at each stop, a wire is bonded between the chip and the board.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Immediately before bonding, however, the chip is glued very carefully to the board by hand, and immediately after bonding, the chip is encapsulated by a human operator dispensing epoxy very carefully by hand. That means wire bonder is the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_30"/>only automated piece of equipment on assembly lines for simple toys. Seeing that process gave me a new appreciation for what goes into those talking Barney dolls that sell for $10 at Target.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The chumby manufacturing process used a bit of automation, too, courtesy of a chip shooter. Chip shooters (as well as pick-and-place machines) place surface-mount components on PCBs so the components can be soldered.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0030-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>The chumby PCB assembly factory in China had dozens of lines filled with tried-and-true Fuji chip shooters</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">It’s absolutely mesmerizing to see a chip shooter in action. The chip shooters at the chumby PCB assembly factory were capable of placing 10,000 to 20,000 components per hour, per machine. This means that each machine could put down 3 to 6 components per second. The robotic assemblies move faster than the eye can see, and it all turns into an awe-inspiring blur. The chip shooter I saw at the chumby factory worked something like a Gatling gun: the chip gun itself was fixed, and the board danced around beneath the gun. The chip shooter actually “looked at” each component and rotated it to the correct orientation before putting it down on the board.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_31"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f0031-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>This is the end of the line for a chumby core board assembly!</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The factory we used for the chumby’s PCB assembly also produced name-brand PC motherboards and seemed to have no problem pushing out well over 10,000 such complex assemblies each day. But even though processes like component placement can be automated, there are some things a machine just can’t do.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec11"><strong>Precision, Injection Molding, and Patience</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">In the course of engineering the chumby, I also had to learn about injection molding, because the circuit board had to go inside a case of some kind. For an electronics guy with little mechanical background, this was no small hill to climb. The concept seems simple: you make a cavity out of steel, push molten plastic into it at high pressure, let it cool, and voilà— a finished part comes out, just like the Play-Doh molds from elementary school.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Oh, if only the process were that simple.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_32"/>Sure, plastic flows, but it’s not particularly runny. It moves slowly, and it cools as it flows. The color of the plastic is impacted by the temperature changes, and when using an improperly designed mold, you can even see flow lines and knit lines in the final product. There’s also a whole assortment of issues with how the finished part is pulled from the mold, how the mold is made and finished, where the gates and runners are for getting the plastic inside the mold, and so on.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Fortunately, PCH had experts in China who knew all about this, and I got to learn mostly by watching.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If I were to summarize injection molding with a single adjective, it would be <em>precision</em>. When done right, the molds are precise to better than hair-thin tolerances, yet they are made out of hard steel. Achieving this level of precision out of such a durable material is no mean feat, and it’s impressive to see a machine cut a mold out of raw steel.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The machine that cut the molds for the chumby case had a moving stage that rapidly pushed around a block of steel probably weighing several hundred pounds; it milled away at the metal in quite a hurry!</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0032-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>The mold-cutting machine used in manufacturing chumbys.<br/>Compare it to the people standing next to it for scale.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_33"/>But machining is only the roughest step in mold making. After the rough shape is cut out, the mold is put into an <em>electrical discharge machine (EDM)</em>, where a burst of electrons knocks microscopic chunks off the steel surface. This is a terrifically tedious process: I’ve watched many EDMs do their job, and it’s like watching paint dry. EDMs are, however, wicked precise, and they yield spectacular, repeatable results.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">From a project management standpoint, the phenomenally long lead times of production-quality injection-molded plastics was the biggest eye opener for me. All told, the chumby mold transformed from a block of raw steel into a first-shot tool in four to six weeks, and I had to go to China and see the tooling shop do its work before I was convinced there wasn’t some gross amount of schedule padding.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Even more harrowing from the risk management standpoint was the lack of good simulation tools to predict how plastics would flow through a mold. If we saw visible blemishes like flow lines and knit lines, we had to wait four to six weeks to see if the new mold was better. Ouch!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Fortunately, the toolmakers Chumby used in China anticipated these issues, and they made the tools to err on the side of excess steel, because removing material to fix a problem is much easier than adding material. It’s like the old carpenter’s saying: measure twice, cut once, and if you have to cut wrong, cut long.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The mold that was used to create the chumby’s back bezel was extra complex, because it involved a process called <em>over-molding</em>. If you happen to own a chumby classic, look at the back side. There’s a rubbery TPE surrounding the hard ABS bezel. Many people assumed this was a glued-on rubber band. In fact, the TPE is molded in place on the back piece. This requires a two-shot mold.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_34"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f0034-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>The final mold for the chumby’s back bezel, inside an injection-molding machine</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">There were actually two molds, and one side of the mold spun around so that the alternating material systems could be molded at the right points in the process.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A lot of hard work goes into the humble plastic parts you see every day, and that’s all part of creating quality products. But at the same time, there’s also a very real need to meet the expectation of cheap prices.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec12"><strong>The Challenge of Quality</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Clearly, with the expectation of low cost of China-made goods comes a great challenge in quality management. Look at the media coverage on topics like lead paint in toys, industrial chemicals in food, and other items made in China, and you can see some of the bad decisions made to keep prices down.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When considering cases like that, I think it’s important to apply Hanlon’s razor. To paraphrase, “Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by ignorance.”<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_35"/>The Brits also have a nice, pithy version of the aphorism: “Cock-up before conspiracy.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Some manufacturers are indeed out there to make a buck at any cost, but I think the majority of mistakes are made out of ignorance. Most of the rank-and-file in factories don’t know what their product is ultimately used for, and under intense pressure to reduce costs, they make those bad decisions. Factories also have to deal with products that are woefully underspecified, as well as customers who overwhelm them with all kinds of frivolous requirements—and most customers don’t follow up in either case. In the end, the factories play a game of “ship and find out,” and if the customer doesn’t notice a missing spec, then the spec must not have been important. It’s not a great game, and it means that customers need to be ever vigilant about audits and keeping the quality standard up.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev1sec13">THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN AMERICA AND CHINA</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">One fundamental problem behind this game is that many Chinese residents do not understand or appreciate basic things that we take for granted in America, and vice versa. Many Chinese factory workers are well educated, but they didn’t grow up in a “gadget culture” like we have in the United States, so you can’t assume anything about their abilities to subjectively interpret specifications for a product.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For example, you can tell a US engineer, “I’d like a button on that panel,” and you’ll probably get something pretty close to what you expect in terms of look and feel, since you and the engineer share common experiences and expectations for a button on a panel. If you did the same in China, you’d probably get something that looks a little awkward and has a clunky feel but is darn cheap and really easy to build and test. While the latter properties are desirable for practical reasons, American gadget connoisseurs just won’t buy something that’s aesthetically awkward or feels clunky.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_36"/>Yet, ultimately, it’s those consumers who want—nay, demand—low-priced goods, and that need drives the decision to manufacture in China. The trouble is that aside from the label on the product that says “<a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">Made in China</a>” or “Made in the USA,” consumers really don’t care about the manufacturing process. What markup would you pay for a gadget that said “Made in the USA” on it? The cost premium for US labor is 10 times what it is in China. Think about it: can the average US factory worker be 10 times more productive than the average Chinese factory worker? It’s a hard multiplier to play against.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I’m not saying there’s no value in domestic vendors: it would be a lot less effort and less risk for me to get stuff made in the United States. In fact, most early prototypes are made there because of the enormous value that the domestic vendors can add. However, the pricing just doesn’t work out for a mass-market product. Nobody would buy it, because its price wouldn’t justify its feature set. One could even accuse me of being lazy if I were to just stick with a domestic vendor and pass the higher cost on to the customers.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev1sec14">BEING INVOLVED IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">In the end, manufacturing in China is the best way to keep costs down, and to maintain quality, there is no substitute for going to China and getting directly involved. Almost every factory will “clean up” the day you come to visit, but with a sharp eye and the right questions, you can see through any quick veneers put in place.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When I evaluated factories for Chumby, I always visited the quality control (QC) room. I expected to see rows of well-maintained and well-worn binders with design documentation and QC standards, as well as <em>golden samples</em>, which are pre-production samples of a product. I’d demand to see the contents of a random binder and the golden sample associated with it, and verify that the employees knew what was going on in the binder. (Some factories do fill product binders with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_37"/>random data.) I also considered hard investments in equipment a good sign: the best manufacturers I visited all had a couple of rooms with sophisticated equipment for thermal, mechanical, and electrical limit testing, and of course, operators were in the room actually using the equipment. (I could definitely imagine a Chinese manufacturer buying a room of equipment just for show.)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">But I suspect that toy manufacturers and food manufacturers don’t fly technicians like me out to factories in China to oversee things on a regular basis. Contrast that with Apple, which regularly sends a cadre of engineers to work intense two-week (or longer) shifts in the factories (usually Foxconn, affectionately nicknamed “Mordor” by some at Apple). As a result, I bumped into many Apple engineers at the expat bars in Shenzhen.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The fact that PCH China Solutions offered Western-style management and quality control on site in China was important for us at Chumby. If we had a problem with a vendor, PCH sent someone to the factory right away to see what was going on—no phone tag, no FedEx filibuster. And factory owners in China tend to be very responsive when you show up at their doorstep.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Thus, Chumby’s approach to the quality conundrum was holistic. We started by having an engineer (me) at the factory almost on day one to survey the situation. It’s important to learn what the factory can and cannot do. I looked at what was being built on the line and what techniques were used. Then, when it came time to engineer the product, I tried to use the processes and techniques that were most comfortable for the factory. When I had to do something new (and any good, innovative product will need to), I picked my battles and focused on them, because anything new would be a multiweek challenge to get right. This strategy applies to even the smallest details: if the factory shrink-wraps goods in plastic, and you <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_38"/>want to wrap your product in paper, then plan to focus heavily on developing the paper-wrapping process, because it’s quite possible that none of the line workers at your factory of choice have even seen a paper-wrapped product before.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Of course, when developing a new process for the chumby, I preferred to be in the factory, and I still do. There’s nothing like standing on the line and showing the workers who will be building your device how it should be made. For example, I personally trained the chumby assembly-line workers on how to attach a piece of copper tape to the LCD assembly to form a proper EMI shield.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">It’s difficult to describe the intricacies of how to fold tape across a complex piece of sheet metal to ensure it makes good electrical contact to the grounding surfaces without risking a short circuit to other components. Subtleties like the fact that the adhesive on one side is a poor insulator also require a basic understanding of physics that line workers simply don’t have. Worse yet, explaining these concepts requires technical words that your translator might not even know.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In my case, even a good 3D drawing or photograph of the finished assembly couldn’t have gotten the whole concept across, because the stiffness of the tape required a particular motion to fold without tearing. Describing the process remotely, approving samples via photographs, and ultimately approving a unit delivered via FedEx might have taken a couple of weeks, but standing in front of a group of workers and demonstrating the process firsthand took only a few minutes. And despite the language barrier, I could tell from their facial expressions and body language whether they understood the importance of a particular step. Given those cues, I immediately reviewed processes that were ambiguous or difficult to master.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Typically, when you can demonstrate a process at this level of detail and intimacy, the workers will get it right within <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_39"/>hours, instead of weeks. This is part of the reason I spent so much time in China during the development of the chumby’s manufacturing process.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0039-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>Everyone was involved in the chumby quality process. This photo shows CEO Steve Tomlin (far left) and Artistic Director Susan Kare (middle) at the sewing factory, working out the details of logo silkscreening.</em></p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev1sec15">HOMEGROWN REMOTE TESTING</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">However, it wasn’t always possible for Chumby to send someone to China. I, for one, preferred not to live in China, so at Chumby, we relied a lot on PCH to watch the quality and make sure things went well, and they did a superb job.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Often, working long distance meant that new processes took weeks to phase in if I wasn’t there to tweak and approve on the spot, because every single tweak involved sending something almost round-trip through FedEx. After going through that process a few times, I learned to allocate two weeks per tweak, as opposed to the few hours it took when I was on the factory floor.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Those sets of two weeks added up fast.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_40"/>Given the difficulty of overseeing operations in China from the United States, remote electronic monitoring of the products’ test results was essential. For the chumby, I developed a set of testers that programmed, personalized, booted, verified, and measured every device off the assembly line. All data from the testing process was recorded to a log, and at the end of the day, the log was transferred to a server in the United States.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This data let me debug a plethora of problems on the floor. I could tell if an operator at a particular tester was having trouble with their barcode scanner. I also immediately knew if there was a yield problem that day, or if the throughput was slower than expected. It was very powerful to have this home-grown audit capability in place, because the factory knew I was watching them. In fact, having such a capability in place can make relationships with the factory run better: the factory eats the cost of yield problems (at least initially), so they appreciate it when the design engineer can offer expedient advice and help before any problems get out of hand.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0040-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>A pair of chumby test stations in the factory in China. There’s quite a story about the trouble we went through getting those laptops into China.</em></p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev1sec16"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_41"/>FURTHER FACTORY TESTING</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Once you’ve finished setting up the testing process, it can run autonomously at the factory. For example, at the chumby’s PCB factory, the first pass of final inspection was done manually— one person went over every circuit board, and then with the help of a cardboard template, another operator ensured that no components were missing. The units then went on to automated testing.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Periodically, both PCH and the factory also performed Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) testing on chumby units to ensure that there was no contamination with a specified set of potentially harmful chemicals, including lead. RoHS is a hazardous chemical safety standard required in Europe but, ironically, not in the United States. Factories routinely do this test on all products, even those only shipping to the United States, because latent contamination on the line could prevent other products manufactured on the same line from shipping to Europe.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Even after all that testing, back in the United States, Chumby continued to sample units for QC purposes. To this end, we regularly ordered, characterized, and dissected devices to ensure that all the operating procedures were being followed.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev1sec17">MISTAKES STILL HAPPEN</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Despite such safeguards, some mistakes will be made on any product. Every product goes through a phase where bugs that weren’t caught by internal QA get pounded out. You have to rely on a top-notch customer service and support team, and you have to plan on being very agile and innovative during this phase to solve the problems and prevent them from ever happening again.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When I was at Chumby, if I heard about a unit in the wild with hardware problems, I actually called the customer who reported it. I wanted to know what went wrong so I could fix the problem and make sure it never happened again, to anyone!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_42"/>My biggest hope with the chumby, however, was to avoid what happened to Microsoft and the Xbox 360’s “red ring of death,” where consoles would experience a major hardware failure, stop working, and just display a red light around the power button, causing huge frustration for players. This problem only exhibited itself after the Xbox 360 had been out for years, after millions of units had been shipped. Situations like the red ring of death are a product engineer’s worst nightmare.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">So you see, getting the chumby (or any product) to the point where it can ship to consumers is just the beginning. The real challenge starts after.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you ever find yourself at this point in the manufacturing process, I wish you luck!</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec18"><strong>CLOSING THOUGHTS</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">The stories told here share some of my adventures—and failures—learning how to build products in volume. The next two chapters are more reflective and less narrative. The next chapter takes us on a virtual tour of three factories to see what we can learn from them, and <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Chapter 3</a> attempts to summarize all the lessons I’ve learned about manufacturing so far.</p>&#13;

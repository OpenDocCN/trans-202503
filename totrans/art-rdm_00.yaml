- en: In this book, randomness is produced by a *random process*, which returns an
    output when requested. The output is usually a number in the range 0 to 1, but
    may be any member of a predefined set of things (integers less than 100, letters,
    colors, dog breeds, and so on). In a random process, knowledge of previous outputs
    is of no utility in predicting future outputs. The output of a random process
    must be *unpredictable*; we can’t know ahead of time what value or element of
    the set will be returned next.

    with whether true randomness is possible; we care only that there are processes
    approximating this definition with sufficient fidelity to allow us to accomplish
    our goals.

    to accomplish a nonrandom goal. As we’ll learn, randomness offers a powerful way
    to approach problems that might otherwise be beyond our ken.

    like NumPy, Matplotlib, and to a lesser degree Pillow, SciPy, and scikit-learn.

    will run under Windows or macOS, but installing the Python libraries might be
    a bit more complicated.

    a command prompt. If you do this, the install commands should succeed.

    experiments include low-resolution test images to demonstrate the concepts at
    work. First, we run the code (after you review the code ahead of time) and interpret
    the results. Most experiments admit multiple parameter settings to allow you to
    build intuition. Second, we walk through the essential parts of the code to understand
    how and where randomness comes into play. Many chapters conclude with an “Exercises”
    section proposing questions designed to encourage you to continue exploring.

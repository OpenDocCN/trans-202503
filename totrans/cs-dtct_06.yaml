    their limited options. The only hatch led up to the deck and the new arrivals.
    The hold itself was nearly empty, the crew having unloaded the cargo upon arriving
    in Usb. Trying to hide here would amount to standing in a corner and whispering
    “You can’t see me.”

    ploy of lying down and playing dead, he saw Notation pull out her badge and stand
    at attention.

    isn’t about to work here. Or most places, for that matter. We’re on a smuggler’s
    ship, investigating the theft of police property. No one on the force even knows
    you’re here, do they? And I’d be willing to bet whoever is coming through that
    door knows that.”

- en: Notation opened her mouth to argue, but paused and closed it again. She slid
    her badge back into her jacket as a stream of large and surprisingly well-dressed
    thugs poured through the door. They spread out in the hold and formed a loose
    circle around Frank and Notation.

    appears that you are not carrying any rotting eels. Thank you for your patience
    as we strive to ensure the safety of this kingdom’s food supply. We’ll be on our
    way now.”

    lifted him off the ground and proceeded to carry him back up onto the deck. Years
    of experience had prepared Frank for this reaction and he had developed a technique
    for positioning himself so as to minimize discomfort, but he could still almost
    feel the bruises forming under their powerful grip.

    middle of the deck and dumped him on the wooden floor. Notation thudded next to
    him, and the thugs again formed a loose circle around them.

    They swayed with the ship but otherwise didn’t move. They appeared to be waiting,
    which meant that whoever was in charge hadn’t arrived yet. Frank seized the opportunity
    and turned to the nearest thug.

    us over to your boss’s employer?”

    days.”

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Vinettees were fanatical about limiting information. They only shared their
    plans with the most senior person on the crew. New hires were required to prove
    their loyalty as they worked their way up the ranks. To get any useful information,
    Frank would need to find the most senior person aboard.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A plan started to form in Frank’s mind. The Vinettees’ crews always arranged
    themselves in order of seniority. It had something to do with mentorship—the most
    junior crew member served as a new hire’s mentor and so forth up the ranks. In
    group situations, they all tended to stand next to their mentors.

    into a loop. Binary search would almost work here, but it would have to be adapted
    to fit the organization of the data: a circle, rather than a straight line of
    values. Unfortunately, this meant that Frank didn’t know where the array started
    or ended. Quickly he developed a new algorithm to efficiently search for the most
    senior crew member. In this case, efficiency meant both minimizing the number
    of thugs with whom he would have to converse and maximizing his chances of getting
    answers before they caught on.'

    counterclockwise around the circle. But he couldn’t be sure yet. As absurd as
    the possibility was, Fifteen-Days and Nineteen-Days could be the most junior and
    senior thugs, respectively. He had been careless with choosing how to start searches
    before; it never ended well. He need another data point. So he chose the middle
    of the remaining range of thugs.
  prefs: []

  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: With this piece of information, his hunch of a counterclockwise ordering was
    confirmed. Therefore, he discarded everyone between Fifteen-Days and the person
    before Thirty-Seven-Days from consideration—the most senior thug, if it wasn’t
    Thirty-Seven-Days, would have to be counterclockwise from her, but before Fifteen-Days.

    Frank said to their captors. “We were caught by a bunch of newbies. What are you
    all, the backup team?”

    most senior one. You’re not exactly being subtle. But why? And how do you know
    they’re standing in order?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    He didn’t know how much time he had before The Boss showed up. He chose the middle
    of the remaining range. “And you?”

    Babysitting a shipment of smuggled cabbages seems like a waste of your time,”
    he said, struggling to remember whether there had been anything about cabbages
    in the log. It was a reasonable bluff anyway. All smugglers dealt in cabbages
    at some point. The recent increase in cabbage taxes had practically doubled the
    black market trade in Usb.

- en: Not every computational problem you face during your career is going to have
    a nice, prepackaged solution. Sure, scholars have spent years studying a vast
    range of problems and writing up solutions. But in the field you’ll find new problems
    with new wrinkles. If you leave this class having just memorized a sheet of algorithms,
    you’re soon going to find yourself in deep trouble.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to handle novel problems, it is important to understand how an algorithm
    works and how it can be adapted to new problems. The basic idea behind binary
    search—using the structure in the data to repeatedly halve the search space—is
    more important than the details of a particular application. Using that one piece
    of intuition, you can adapt binary search to search circular (but still sorted)
    arrays or even determine the optimal temperature for your coffee, by testing warmer
    and cooler coffee until it’s “just right.”

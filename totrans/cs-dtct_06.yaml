  zh: 在你职业生涯中，面对的并非每一个计算问题都会有现成的、打包好的解决方案。当然，学者们花了多年时间研究广泛的问题并写出了解决方案。但在这个领域，你会遇到新的问题和新的变数。如果你仅仅通过背诵一张算法清单从这门课上毕业，那么很快你就会发现自己陷入了深深的困境。
- en: In order to handle novel problems, it is important to understand how an algorithm
    works and how it can be adapted to new problems. The basic idea behind binary
    search—using the structure in the data to repeatedly halve the search space—is
    more important than the details of a particular application. Using that one piece
    of intuition, you can adapt binary search to search circular (but still sorted)
    arrays or even determine the optimal temperature for your coffee, by testing warmer
    and cooler coffee until it’s “just right.”

  zh: 为了处理新颖的问题，理解算法的工作原理以及如何将其应用于新问题是非常重要的。二分查找的基本思想——利用数据结构反复将搜索空间对半分割——比具体应用的细节更加重要。通过这一点直觉，你可以将二分查找应用于查找环形（但仍然有序的）数组，甚至通过不断测试更温暖和更凉的咖啡，直到找到“恰到好处”的温度。

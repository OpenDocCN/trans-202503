    their limited options. The only hatch led up to the deck and the new arrivals.

    themselves in order of seniority. It had something to do with mentorship—the most
    junior crew member served as a new hire’s mentor and so forth up the ranks. In
    group situations, they all tended to stand next to their mentors.

    senior thugs, respectively. He had been careless with choosing how to start searches

    search—using the structure in the data to repeatedly halve the search space—is
    more important than the details of a particular application. Using that one piece
    of intuition, you can adapt binary search to search circular (but still sorted)
    arrays or even determine the optimal temperature for your coffee, by testing warmer
    and cooler coffee until it’s “just right.”

			</header>
			<p class="ChapterIntro"><a id="451"/>The complex image of a rose (see <a id="figref17-ill"/><a href="c15b.xhtml#ill-fig17">Figure 17 in the color insert</a>) was created to showcase Inkscape's 
versatility. A single drawing of a rose—traced from a photo—is rendered in a different way in each of the
six square windows as well as in the background. A single tutorial showing the
stages of creating this image is like seven different tutorials on ways to draw a rose—or anything else, for that matter.</p>
			<p>I started with a photo, but if you can draw well, you don’t need to do that. Just draw whatever you like on an empty canvas.
Tracing a photo, however, is a useful technique by itself.</p>
			<p>
				Go to <span class="ui"><strong>File<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Import</strong></span> (or press Ctrl-I) to import the photo, and scale and position it as
convenient. Rename the layer with the image to <span class="ui">background</span>. You will need to hide and show the photo several times, which is much easier
to do when it's in its own layer. Reducing the photo’s opacity and locking its layer so you don’t move it accidentally is a good idea.</p>
			<p><a id="452"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_452" title="452"/>Then,  create a new
layer called <span class="ui">ink</span> and start to trace
over the outlines and the boundaries between colors in the photo (<a href="#fig25-1">Figure 25-1</a>).</p>

			<p>
				The best tool to use for tracing an image depends on the nature of the image and
the result you want to get. If you're tracing geometric shapes that can be rendered as straight lines and Bézier segments, use the Pen tool. If you need more
freeform and artistic shapes but want to minimize the number of paths and nodes,
the Pencil tool is a better choice. Finally, if you want an expressive, artistically untidy style, 
use the Calligraphic pen. I wanted my drawing to be minimal but artistic and natural, and I had no reason to save on the number of nodes, so
I used the Calligraphic pen, as shown in <a href="#fig25-2">Figure 25-2</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig25-2"/><figure>

			</figure>
			<p>
				I used a pressure-sensitive tablet pen, allowing me to vary the width of the brush stroke by how hard I pressed the pen. 
You can get a similar result with a regular mouse, though. In fact, you may even prefer using a mouse, because
controlling the stroke thickness with pen pressure, although nice in theory, requires a lot of practice and rarely produces the exact result you desire.
A better approach is to draw with a constant width in the Calligraphic pen and then apply the Tweak tool's Shrink/Grow mode
(<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.6.4">12.6.4</a>) to make your strokers thicker or thinner where appropriate, as <a href="#fig25-3">Figure 25-3</a> demonstrates.</p>

			<p><a id="453"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_453" title="453"/>The black and white outline is ready; now let's add color to it. 
With a crisp ink outline, I wanted a soft washed-out coloring. To do that, hide the<span class="ui">background</span> layer, create a new layer called <span class="ui">watercolor</span>, and put it below
the <span class="ui">ink</span> layer. After that, with a wide calligraphic brush, make a few wild strokes: 
red under the rose, green under the stalk and leaf, and various shades of blue around
those. Finally, blur those strokes by a large enough radius so they almost blend together (<a href="#fig25-4">Figure 25-4</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig25-4"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t01-04.svg.png"/>

					<p>Figure 25-4: Adding a blurred background</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				This already looks nice, but not nice enough. The smoothly blurred blotches are<em>too</em> smooth—and, frankly, boring. To make them more natural, I 
expanded the simple <span class="ui">Gaussian Blur</span> filter applied to the background by adding more
primitives to it. First, I added a <span class="ui">Turbulence</span> primitive, composited with the blur, to imitate
paper grain. This looked better but was still too uniform—too computer-generated. I then added another <span class="ui">Turbulence</span> component with a much larger period,
which I used twice: once via a <span class="ui">Displacement Map</span>, for making the overall watercolor more
blotchy and splotchy, and then via a <span class="ui">Composite</span> operator, for modulating the small-scale
paper grain to imitate paper more realistically, where some areas are smoother and others
are more grainy, as shown in <a href="#fig25-5">Figure 25-5</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig25-5"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t01-05.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 25-5: Building up the "realistic watercolor" filter for the
background</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="454"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_454" title="454"/>The final composite filter, which I called <em>Sandy Blur</em> (see <a href="c17.xhtml#section17.5.2">17.5.2</a> for more details),
looked a lot more realistic but was slower to render. I had to switch to the No Filters mode (<a href="c17.xhtml#section17.5.4">17.5.4</a>) so I could work without the annoying rendering delays.</p>
			<p>
				As a last touch, you can duplicate the content of the <span class="ui">ink</span> layer and blur it to form a shadow, or (as I
did) soften the ink lines slightly by outsetting (thickening) duplicates of the ink paths and making them semitransparent.
The rose drawing’s background is done.</p>
			<a id="section25.1"/><h2>25.1 Treatment 1: Engraving</h2>
			<p>
				With the <span class="ui">ink</span> and <span class="ui">watercolor</span> layers finished, I went on to create a
series of treatments—demos on how to render the same image differently.
I overlaid the rose with six randomly scattered squares and limited each treatment to one
square.</p>
			<p>The first rendition is an engraving made of lattices of curved variable-width
pen strokes. For this treatment, I chose an area of the rose where the curving and
shading of the petals was especially deep. Engraving is an intricate art;
I do not claim that my attempt is any good, but I was surprised by how
easy it was to do using Inkscape's tools.</p>
			<p>
				When you have an outline and want to turn it into an engraving, the first
step is planning. Think about the most natural directions for the engraving
lines in each part of the drawing. Create a new layer and draw several wide-spaced test
strokes with the Calligraphic pen, trying to capture the changing
curvature of each area while maintaining the best directional contrast at the boundaries
where the areas of different curvature meet (<a href="#fig25-6">Figure 25-6</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig25-6"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t01-06.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 25-6: Choosing the engraving square and doing test
strokes</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="455"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_455" title="455"/>Once you get an idea of how you want the engraving strokes to go, move the test strokes aside (but keep
them for reference) and use the Calligraphic pen's guide tracking feature (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.2.7">14.2.7</a>) to fill
each area with evenly spaced uniform-width strokes (<a href="#fig25-7">Figure 25-7</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig25-7"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t01-07.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 25-7: Creating an evenly spaced lattice with the Calligraphic
pen</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Don't worry if the direction or
curvature of your strokes drifts off somewhat; you will be able to fix that later. What
matters more at this stage is the uniformity of spacing. You can rotate the
canvas (Ctrl-Shift-wheel) to make it easier to stroke. Draw beyond the edges of the
area you're filling; it's much easier to trim strokes that are too long than it is to extend short ones.</p>
			<p>
				You’ll use the Tweak tool to do the rest of the work (<a href="#fig25-8">Figure 25-8</a>).</p>
				<a id="fig25-8"/>
				<figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t01-08.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 25-8: Finalizing the engraving with the Tweak
tool</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="456"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_456" title="456"/>Use the Shrink mode to trim
line ends and thin them, the Grow mode to thicken, and the Push mode to move
and curve the entire lattice (select all of the lattice’s strokes to bend them together).
Don't worry about the trimmed strokes’ unsightly butts. In the final result, the ink layer’s wide boundary strokes will cover them.</p>
			<a id="section25.2"/><h2>25.2 Treatment 2: Tessellation</h2>
			<p>This treatment is easy to do because it's mostly automatic. The only
tricky part is creating the tessellation itself—that is, a pattern of complex
interlocked tiles covering the entire plane without holes or overlapping.</p>
			<p>
				Draw a shape—any shape—and create a pattern of tiled clones from it (<span class="ui"><strong>Edit<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Clone<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Create 
Tiled Clones</strong></span>, <a href="c16.xhtml#section16.6">16.6</a>) with any nontrivial symmetry group; I used P3. At first, the clones do not form any kind of tessellation; it
is your task to reshape the source shape—with its clones already in place— until the
clones meet and smoothly interlock. This step is easier than it might seem. The fact that
the clones immediately reflect any change in the source shape makes the task almost
trivial. Just add nodes and move them to grow appendages or make depressions in your shape. Each of the
clones will mirror those changes. Keep sculpting the shape until the clones precisely interlock
and cover the entire plane, as shown in <a href="#fig25-9">Figure 25-9</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig25-9"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t01-09.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 25-9: Creating a tessellation</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Now, let’s make the pattern reflect the background colors, so that the rose
drawing shows through. Once set up, the process is mostly automatic. Make sure the <span class="ui"><strong>Use saved
size and position of the tile</strong></span> checkbox is on, delete the existing tiling
(<span class="ui"><strong>Remove</strong></span> button), and set the <span class="ui"><strong>Width</strong></span> and <span class="ui"><strong>Height</strong></span> for the
pattern to cover all of the area you want covered. Unset the fill color of the original
shape (right-click the <span class="ui"><strong>Fill:</strong></span> swatch in the status bar and choose<span class="ui"><strong>Unset</strong></span>). Then, go to the <span class="ui"><strong>Trace</strong></span> tab, enable <span class="ui"><strong>Trace the drawing under
the tiles</strong></span>, pick <span class="ui"><strong>Color</strong></span>, and apply the picked value to the clones'<span class="ui"><strong>Color</strong></span> as well (<a href="#fig25-10">Figure 25-10</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig25-10"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t01-10.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 25-10: Color tracing with the tessellation</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="457"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_457" title="457"/>As a final touch, let's add slight glossy highlights to the tiles using filters
(<a href="c17.xhtml#ch17">Chapter 17</a>). One problem with this is that the gloss filter is not symmetric—it has one
special direction from which the light is cast. However, if you apply such a filter to
rotated <em>clones</em> in the pattern, the filter will be rotated together with the clones and
all highlights will appear as if lit from different directions. To work around this, simply 
group all tiled clones (Ctrl-G) and apply the <span class="ui"><strong>Button</strong></span>
filter from <span class="ui"><strong>Filters<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Bevels</strong></span> to the group, as shown in <a href="#fig25-11">Figure 25-11</a>.</p>

			<h2>25.3 Treatment 3: A Field of Cubes</h2>
			<p>
				Like the color-tracing tessellation, this treatment uses the <span class="ui">Create Tiled Clones</span> dialog. In other respects, however,
this design is the direct opposite. It’s randomized instead of regular, pseudo-3D instead of flat, and uses three
different original objects—and thus three intermingled patterns—instead of a single one.</p>
			<p><a id="458"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_458" title="458"/>Start by drawing a cube with the 3D Box tool. Convert it into a group of paths (Shift-Ctrl-C) and duplicate it (Ctrl-D). In one copy of
the cube, enter it as the group, select all six sides and union them (Ctrl-+), then ungroup. This turns a cube into a single cube-shaped
path. Unset its fill—in the clones, this one will take the color of the background. For the second copy of the cube, use 50 percent opacity and either white
or black on each of the sides without unioning. You can also add an ellipse with a white-to-transparent elliptic gradient on the foremost corner of
the cube as a highlight (<a href="#fig25-12">Figure 25-12</a>, left). This is the shading layer that makes each box look like a box despite a change in overall
color.</p>
			<p>
				Finally, position the shading cube exactly on top of the background shape and group them together.
This is your cloneable object that can both pick the background color with its unset-fill shape and present a pseudo-3D appearance with the semitransparent overlay. Repeat all these steps for two more differently oriented cubes, so there are three overall (<a href="#fig25-12">Figure 25-12</a>, right).</p>
			<a id="fig25-12"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t01-12.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 25-12: Original objects for the cube scattering</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Now, select a prepared cube and create a P1-symmetry scattering over the area
you want to cover, using color-to-color tracing in the <span class="ui">Create Tiled Clones</span>
dialog (<a href="c16.xhtml#section16.6.6">16.6.6</a>). Randomize their rotation (slightly, so as not to destroy the perception of all boxes being
in a common perspective), their size, and their position. To imitate the effect of a 3D
field, set scaling and row spacing to increase per row from top to bottom, as shown in <a href="#fig25-13">Figure 25-13</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig25-13"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t01-13.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 25-13: Scattering the cubes</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Repeat this procedure for the two other cubes you've prepared, covering the same
area. This combined field of cubes doesn't yet look like a <em>field</em>, because
the z-order is wrong. The cubes that are closer to the bottom and larger are supposed to
be closer to us and therefore on top of the others, but they are not. <a id="459"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_459" title="459"/>To fix this, use
the <span class="ui"><strong>Restack</strong></span> extension (from <span class="ui"><strong>Extensions<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Arrange</strong></span>) to sort the z-order of
the boxes so they stack from top to bottom. Then, do a single <span class="ui"><strong>Unclump</strong></span> action
from the <span class="ui"><strong>Align and Distribute</strong></span> dialog so the arrangement of cubes has fewer gaps
(<a href="#fig25-14">Figure 25-14</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig25-14"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t01-14.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 25-14: The field of cubes: z-order sorting and unclumping</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The goal is to reproduce a square area of the rose's <span class="ui">background</span>
layer. However, if you use automatic
color-to-color background tracing (as done in <a href="c16.xhtml#section16.6.6">16.6.6</a>) for all three patterns placed over
the target area, you may find the colors resulting from that tracing are quite drab.
That is because each cube samples color from a relatively large area that it covers, averages it, and makes
it less saturated than the original background image. Also, the 3D shading overlay in each cube washes out the color of the background shape.</p>
			<p>
				To fix this, you can simply paint the cubes manually, as shown in <a href="#fig25-15">Figure 25-15</a>.</p>
				<a id="fig25-15"/>
				<figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t01-15.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 25-15: Painting colors on the cubes</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Just select all the cube
clones, choose the Tweak tool’s Color Paint mode (<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.9">8.9</a>), choose a bright red
color (or pick it from the background image with the Dropper, <a href="c08.xhtml#section8.8">8.8</a>), and paint over
the image’s red area. Then, do the same for the other colored areas, including the black ink
lines. (If it doesn’t work, you may have forgotten to unset fill in the bottom path in
each cube, see <a href="#fig25-12">Figure 25-12</a>.) Such a thoroughly bitmap-like paint job is a fun way to edit a vector drawing!</p>
			<p>
				Finally, group all the cubes and clip (<a href="c18.xhtml#section18.3">18.3</a>) the group to the chosen square.</p>
				<a id="section25.4"/>
				<h2>
				25.4 <a id="460"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_460" title="460"/>Treatment 4: Photorealistic Drawing</h2>
			<p>This photorealistic rendition is the most time-consuming of all. I wanted to re-create the original
photograph as closely as possible in this part of the drawing. Absolute photorealism, of
course, is neither possible nor desirable, but you can strive for the characteristic
"vector photorealism" look that is attractive in its own way. The key here is
a smart use of shapes, gradients, and blurs.</p>
			<p>
				First, locate the square in which you're going to work and reveal (but leave locked) the layer that has
the source photo. Start by dividing your drawing into areas, each
approximated by flat color or a single gradient. Use the Pencil tool (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.1.2">14.1.2</a>) to create
these areas and the Gradient tool (<a href="c10.xhtml#section10.1">10.1</a>) to paint and stretch gradients across
them, as shown in <a href="#fig25-16">Figure 25-16</a>. Use the Dropper tool (<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.8">8.8</a>) to pick the exact colors from the photo
layer.</p>
			<a id="fig25-16"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t01-16.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 25-16: Approximating areas of the image using paths with
gradients</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				To soften the edges, blur the shapes a bit (no more than 2 percent) using the <span class="ui"><strong>Fill and
Stroke</strong></span> dialog. To apply some naturalistic texture, draw a 40 percent gray, 10 percent opaque
rectangle over the shapes and apply <span class="ui"><strong>Filters<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Overlays<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Speckle</strong></span> to it. In the<span class="ui"><strong>Filter Editor</strong></span> dialog, increase the frequency of the random texture (<span class="ui"><strong>Base
Frequency</strong></span> in the <span class="ui"><strong>Turbulence</strong></span> primitive), as <a href="#fig25-17">Figure 25-17</a> demonstrates.</p>
			<a id="fig25-17"/><figure>

					<p>Figure 25-17: Blurring and texturizing the background</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="461"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_461" title="461"/>What exists so far is just a layer of rough
background paint, upon which you’ll overlay the fine details—reproducing the
characteristic wrinkles and texture of the rose petals. You’ll primarily use
the Calligraphic pen (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.2">14.2</a>) with relatively small <span class="ui">Width</span>, zero<span class="ui">Fixation</span>, and some <span class="ui">Tremor</span>. Typically you would draw with
semitransparent black or white for shades or highlights, respectively. You can
also try barely saturated versions of complimentary colors (for example, pale green for red
areas) that can often make your drawing look more natural—in real life, color tints are never perfectly uniform.</p>
			<p>
				Of course, you’ll need to blur these semitransparent brush strokes as well.
Don't apply blur to each stroke separately—this would be tedious to do (unlike
opacity, blur is not retained in the tool's style and therefore not applied to the
next created object automatically) and slower to render. Instead, draw a single stroke,
group it (Ctrl-G), blur the group, and then enter the group
(Ctrl-Enter). Now, each new object you create with Calligraphic pen or any
other tool gets added to the blurred group and becomes blurred along 
with its siblings (<a href="#fig25-18">Figure 25-18</a>). When finished drawing within the group, press Ctrl-Backspace to leave it.</p>

					<p>Figure 25-18: Adding hand-drawn foreground strokes</p>

			</figure>
			<p>Pay special attention to the edges of the objects on your drawing—properly
emphasizing edges with dense highlights and shadows is the key to an attractive "painterly" look.
Making the edges of highlights and shadows slightly more intense often works well.</p>
			<a id="section25.5"/><h2>25.5 Treatment 5: Map</h2>
			<p>
				The map treatment is less an example of a practically useful technique than it is a
creative reinterpretation of something plain and straightforward. I was just playing with an
eight-color Potrace tracing (<span class="ui">Path<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Trace Bitmap</span>, <a href="c18.xhtml#section18.5.2">18.5.2</a>) of this area of the
original photo when I noticed that it acquired an interesting map-like look when I discarded
the fill colors and assigned a dashed stroke to the resulting shapes, as shown in <a href="#fig25-19">Figure 25-19</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig25-19"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t01-19.svg.png"/>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="462"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_462" title="462"/>To imitate the surface of an old map, I created a yellowish, slightly rough (<span class="ui">Filters<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Distort<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Roughen</span>),
semitransparent (so that the background drawing showed through a bit) background rectangle.
Then I added some cryptic text labels to complete the picture.</p>
			<a id="section25.6"/><h2>25.6 Treatment 6: Spruced-Up Photo</h2>
			<p>
				For the spruced-up photo treatment, I wanted to showcase Inkscape's abilities
as a tool for making bitmaps look better, rather than as a vector editor.
Of course "better" is a subjective term,
but you can make a number of simple edits in Inkscape to improve almost any photo’s appearance.<a id="figref18-ill"/><a href="c15b.xhtml#ill-fig18">Figure 18 in the color insert</a> shows a fragment of the original rose  photo with colors brightened, shadows deepened, highlights added, and textures empasized.</p>
			<p>
				As a final touch for the combined rose image, I added dotted frames to all six squares containing various treatments. <a id="figref17"/><a href="c15b.xhtml#ill-fig17">Figure 17 in the color insert</a> shows the complete image.</p>
			<p>Whenever I import a photo into Inkscape, I usually make one or more of the following changes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					I apply <span class="ui">Filters<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Color<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Lightness-Contrast</span> to expand the photo’s dynamic range. In a bitmap editor such as Photoshop or GIMP, I would use the <span class="ui">Levels</span> command for this, but in Inkscape, the <span class="ui">Lightness-Contrast</span> filter is the closest approximation. The idea is to stretch all the colors of the photo apart so that its darkest area becomes maximally dark (that is, black) and its lightest area becomes maximally light (that is, white). If performed correctly, no image details are lost in this operation, but the photo's visual appearance improves, often considerably. I typically enable the <span class="ui">Live preview</span> checkbox in the <span class="ui">Lightness-Contrast</span> dialog and tweak the two values, trying to contrast without losing either shades or highlights.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Lightness-Contrast</span> range expansion works on the entire image indiscriminately. Usually, however, I can see that some areas would benefit from manual lightening or darkening. My favorite way of doing that is to create a white circle (<a href="c11.xhtml#section11.4">11.4</a>), paint it with a white-to-transparent elliptic gradient (<a href="c10.xhtml#section10.1">10.1</a>), and assign the <span class="ui">Overlay</span> blend mode (<a href="c17.xhtml#section17.2">17.2</a>) to it. I duplicate it, move it to where I need a highlight, and scale to taste; if a particular highlight seems too strong, <a id="463"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_463" title="463"/>I tone down its opacity. For emphasizing a dark detail, I create a similar shader object with black instead of white. Sometimes, I also use other colors of highlights for color accents. That's what I did on <a href="c15b.xhtml#ill-fig18">Figure 18 in the color insert</a> (bottom) to make the shading of the petals more expressive; the extents of the overlays are shown with the black and white outlines.</li>

					Almost always, an image that is part of a design composition needs to have its saturation adjusted. Some images—such as our rose—look best when highly saturated. Most of the time, however, a photo may benefit from being fully or partially desaturated. For this, I use the <span class="ui">Filters<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Color<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Color Shift</span> filter that has two sliders for hue and saturation.</li>
				<li>
					I often improve low-resolution photos by using the <span class="ui">Filters<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Image Effects<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Sharpen</span> or <span class="ui">Sharpen More</span> filters.</li>

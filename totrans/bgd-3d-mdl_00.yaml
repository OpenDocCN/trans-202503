    rise of computers, engineers used *technical drawing* to describe three-dimensional
    objects.

    Maybe you made a sketch for a coffee table you were building, or you drew a simple
    floor plan of your bathroom to show a contractor where you wanted that new whirlpool
    tub.

    as clearly as possible. It’d be inconvenient to come home to find that your contractor
    had blocked the bathroom door with your new bathtub because your drawing was ambiguous.'

- en: Demands on technical drawing skills exploded in the 18th century, thanks to
    the Industrial Revolution. The complexity of both machines and product design
    grew exponentially, and as a result, required more precise instructions for making
    parts. A rough sketch might have been enough for a carpenter building a table,
    but steam engines and industrial tools required drawings that were far more detailed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This necessity gave rise to the formal discipline of *drafting*, the practice
    of creating technical drawings, like the patent assembly drawing for a steam engine
    shown in [Figure 1-1](ch01.xhtml#ch01fig1). Drafters (also called *draftspeople*)
    began creating engineering drawings that removed all ambiguity about their designs.
    The single most important part of the drafting profession is the ability to create
    drawings that can be interpreted in only *one* way. Factories churn out parts
    by the thousands; imagine having to scrap all of those parts because a machinist
    misinterpreted the drawing they were working from.

    language. This design language evolved and became well-defined over time, as the
    patent system developed and manufacturers began sharing ideas. It eventually standardized
    through the work of organizations such as the American Society of Mechanical Engineers
    (ASME), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and the International
    Organization for Standardization (ISO).

    symbols to use), they all accomplish the same thing: defining a visual language
    for technical drawings that, when used properly, removes all ambiguity. Someone
    trained in a specific standard can interpret a drawing created to that standard
    with total objectivity. These standards encompass all aspects of a technical drawing—from
    what font a dimension should be to the proper line weights and styles to use for
    different features of a part. Until recently, drafters hand-drew all of these
    details using a variety of tools to help do the job, like drafting tables (shown
    in [Figure 1-2](ch01.xhtml#ch01fig2)), mounted pantographs, and specialized pens,
    rulers, squares, and curve templates.'

- en: By the latter half of the 20th century, drafters’ jobs had become incredibly
    complex. It wasn’t uncommon for a product to have thousands of individual parts,
    particularly in the automotive and aerospace industries. Manufacturers needed
    technical drawings for every one of those parts; they also needed drawings illustrating
    their assembly and even more drawings for tasks like maintenance and repair.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every single one of those drawings consumed drafters’ time, even as the demands
    of the marketplace led to ever more intricate designs. Luckily, as with just about
    every other profession on the planet, the burgeoning digital age revolutionized
    drafting.

    the potential benefits of using computers for engineering. After all, the complex
    calculations needed for the engineering tasks of the 1940s and 1950s were exactly
    the kind of problems digital computers would later solve. In 1952, researchers
    at MIT successfully built a digital *numerical control (NC)* machine too. This
    became the first milling machine controlled by a computer and laid the groundwork
    for future *computer-aided design (CAD)* systems.

    displays, storage capacity, and user interfaces. Nevertheless, the engineering
    world saw CAD’s potential, and any organization with the funds to do so rushed
    to get in the game. MIT and various automotive and aerospace companies developed
    proto-CAD systems independently during the ’50s and ’60s. At MIT, for instance,
    Ivan Sutherland developed software called SKETCHPAD that allowed an operator to
    draw with a light pen on a CRT monitor. During a 1963 presentation on SKETCHPAD,
    Sutherland claimed that “for highly repetitive drawings or drawings where accuracy
    is required, SKETCHPAD is sufficiently faster than conventional techniques to
    be worthwhile.” (You can read the presentation at [*https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-574.pdf*](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-574.pdf).)

    Citroën, Renault, Lockheed, Boeing, and Bell worked on commercial CAD software.
    These early CAD systems, like the one shown in [Figure 1-3](ch01.xhtml#ch01fig3),
    mostly aimed to replace drafting done by hand, and the ability to create (and
    modify) technical drawings electronically sped up drafting dramatically.

    demands for true mechanical, parametric, 3D solid–modeling CAD systems. They started
    with very basic software, like Autodesk 123D and SketchUp. While these were a
    step forward (and free), they had serious constraints. Users were mostly limited
    to working with primitive polygons, and advanced modeling was either very difficult

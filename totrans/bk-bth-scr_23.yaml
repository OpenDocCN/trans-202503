- en: In this part of the book, you’ll learn about pseudo-environment variables, writing
    reports, recursion, text searches, automatic restarts, and bat files that build
    other bat files. Other topics will delve into conditional execution (again), arrays,
    hash tables, and testing and troubleshooting. I’ll finish up with object-oriented
    design and an application of it in the form of data structures called stacks and
    queues. Many of these topics weren’t envisioned by the creators of Batch. That
    hasn’t stopped us before and won’t stop us in the following chapters.

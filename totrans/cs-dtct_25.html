<p class="noindent">Frank spent the night alternately reviewing clues, watching out the windows for Vinettee thugs, and bemoaning the safe house’s lack of food. Soon, he realized that it wasn’t just food that was missing. The apartment lacked the standard equipment—blank notebooks, quills, and sturdy furniture—found in every police building. Once he thought to look for it, Frank quickly located a large “For Rent” sign in the window. He was just lucky the police hadn’t rented it out or changed the combination yet.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">After a few hours, Frank convinced himself the Vinettees wouldn’t find him. He abandoned the windows, began to pace the empty apartment, and focused on the case. The When and Where were easy—the clues suggested an attack on the castle tomorrow night. Unfortunately, aside from the When and Where, Frank still didn’t have any answers. In particular, the Who, Why, How, and Could-I-Sneak-Out-for-Food-Without-the-Vinettees-Seeing-Me remained important open questions.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">After an hour of pacing while trying to fill in the remaining details, Frank had started to doubt even the When and Where. An attack on the castle seemed too obvious, and the police were already prepared for it. Even Socks was telling everyone he knew to watch for it.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_208"/><img src="../images/f0208-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank stopped and swore as realization dawned. Socks had to be involved. With a familiar sense of <em>I knew I shouldn’t trust anyone</em>, Frank replayed the events of the last few days in his mind, this time recognizing the signs. He should have seen it when Socks’s staff “accidentally” ignited the papers in the cell and destroyed the evidence. He should have realized that someone had tipped off the spy about his visit to the cloak shop. He should have at least wondered about the absurd and conveniently timed rescue with the barrels of pickled eels. But above all else, he should have been absolutely certain from the moment Socks incorrectly inserted a node into the binary tree. No expert in binary trees would ever make that mistake by accident. It was true that he’d been suspicious the whole time, but then again, Frank suspected everyone all the time.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The realization left him with even more questions. The Where and When were unanswered again. If Socks had been feeding them false information, Frank had to question everything. What were the wizards going to do, and how were they going to do it? Knowing the Why would also be nice, but Frank found that whenever he foiled elaborate plots, the perpetrators tended to babble on about <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_209"/>the Why without provocation. By this point, he’d also given up on sneaking out for food, closing that question for now with a growling stomach.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“How does the mask fit in?” Frank muttered to himself. If the thieves were planning to attack the castle, could they still use the mask? Or would Marcus’s ID badges render it useless? Did they just need it to break into the police station? And what records were the thieves after? Frank started enumerating the questions in his notebook. They quickly outnumbered the clues.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank thought about his next step. With such a limited timeline, he needed to push far into the realm of <em>heuristics</em>—rules of thumb that point algorithms in the right direction. For example, when searching for a lost turtle, Frank used the common “Check nearby first” heuristic, because turtles are slow. When seeking the freshest pot of coffee in the station, he relied on “Check the fullest cauldron” because it was often the most recently made. And when navigating to a tall castle in an unknown city, “Walk in the direction of the castle first” had usually gotten him there after only a few dead ends. Heuristics weren’t perfect, but they provided useful information.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0209-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">During his time on the police force, Frank had come to trust one heuristic above all others: follow the most concrete clues first. Specific names and physical evidence always trumped general suspicions and rumors.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_210"/>It was a heuristic Frank had ignored only once in his career, when Glass Box Billy had provided multiple tips regarding an upcoming robbery. First, Billy had told Frank the getaway cart’s exact waiting location, model, and pitch of wheel squeak. Second, Billy had relayed a rumor, overheard between bouts of raucous cheering at a game of darts, that Rebecca Vinettee was personally involved and the target had something to do with fish.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank had ignored every good police algorithm and decided to go after Rebecca Vinettee directly. He knew that she would disappear before they loaded the cart, probably using an alternate route back to the hideout. He had to catch her before she could vanish. He staked out the capital’s Fish Depot, which was only two blocks from the getaway cart’s location.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As the captain would later explain with excessively loud shouting, the Fish Depot happened to be two blocks in the wrong direction. On the other hand, the Orb Emporium was only a quarter of a block away from the getaway cart. A gang completely unaffiliated with the Vinettees stole 64 high-quality spherical glass orbs and 2 prototype cubic orbs, loaded them onto the getaway cart, and drove away with wheels squeaking precisely as annoyingly as Glass Box Billy had indicated. Frank’s description of Billy’s tip, and his insistence on adding a new heuristic of “always suspect the Vinettees,” did not convince the captain.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the current case, however, Frank was running out of even vague clues. He’d exhausted most of his concrete leads and was well into the realm of speculation and suspicion. If he wanted to make any more progress, he would need more information. He turned to his second most trusted heuristic: when at a dead end, collect more information. He needed to know more about the mask, how it could be used, and what magical defenses could thwart it. In this case, that meant finding an expert.</p>&#13;

<p class="sbsub"><em><strong>Excerpt from Professor Drecker’s Lecture</strong></em></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Heuristics are rules of thumb that help point algorithms in the right direction. While you’ll undoubtedly hear some officers dismiss heuristics as random guesses, you’ll also see those same officers fall back on techniques and rules of thumb that have served them well in the past. It’s important to realize that heuristics, like all information, are of varying quality.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">One of the clearest examples of heuristics is navigating in the physical world. Whether you’re wandering through a maze, searching an unknown city, or simply finding your way to the mess hall, you’ll find yourself using heuristics to guide your search. Given two paths, which do you try first? A common and often reliable heuristic is to prioritize options according to simplified distance measures. My favorite is to use “as the bird flies” distance: How far away is the goal if there’s nothing in your way? In practice, this heuristic means I always take the path that looks like it is getting me closer to the goal—the path that at least starts out in the correct direction. I might run into a few dead ends this way, but overall I’ve found this to be a good heuristic.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Of course, there are plenty of terrible heuristics as well. Officers who use new heuristics without properly vetting them can find themselves in deep trouble. A few years ago, a young officer created a particularly bad heuristic. After unprecedented success busting a smuggling ring, he got it into his head that all investigations must start at the docks. The problem was that this heuristic is wrong. It didn’t help <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_212"/>point his investigations in the right direction. In fact, it often led him immediately to a dead end. After 18 failed investigations, his captain assigned him to permanently patrolling the docks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Heuristics shouldn’t be random guesses. They need to contain some amount of useful information and be tailored to the correct problem.</p>&#13;

- en: Have you ever considered that you could buy a computer for $35? And no, we’re
    not talking about an ancient computer from a pawn shop. We’re talking about the
    Raspberry Pi—a computer board about the size of a credit card. But don’t be fooled
    by its fragile appearance; it’s much more powerful than it seems.

- en: 'The Raspberry Pi was developed in the United Kingdom by Eben Upton, founder
    of the Raspberry Pi Foundation. Upton and his colleagues noticed a decline in
    the skills of students applying to study computer science at the University of
    Cambridge and realized it was because newer generations of students had grown
    up with computers that were easy to use. The students never needed to learn how
    computers really work and didn’t have much opportunity to program or tinker. Upton
    developed the Raspberry Pi as a way to promote teaching basic computer science
    in schools. This is why the Pi is a bare board rather than a computer in a case:
    so everyone can see the components of a computer.'

    introduced in 2012\. The Raspberry Pi has become popular not just among students
    but also electronics hobbyists, tinkerers, computer scientists, and “kids” of
    all ages.

    write documents, watch videos, and so on—but that’s not its main purpose. The
    Pi is something that you can experiment with, hack, and play with to build your
    own programs and inventions. The Raspberry Pi and similar boards made it not only
    possible but *easy* to get involved in the world of electronics and programming,
    resulting in an outpouring of creative inventions all over the globe. Now, it’s
    your time to invent something.

  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*20 Easy Raspberry Pi Projects* is a collection of 20 projects to build with
    the Raspberry Pi. We believe that the best way to discover new concepts is through
    practice, and a project book is an excellent way to get started.'

- en: The book starts with a quick introduction to the Raspberry Pi and the Python
    programming language, and then jumps into the projects. The book follows a learn-by-doing
    approach, which means you don’t need to spend countless hours learning theoretical
    concepts before actually building something cool.

- en: You’ll learn by building fun and interactive projects like a home surveillance
    system and a Wi-Fi controlled robot. You’ll also design user-friendly interfaces
    to control electronics, make Internet of Things projects, build a website, create
    your own games, and much more.

- en: Don’t worry if you don’t have any experience programming or making circuits.
    Each project gives you step-by-step instructions to set up the circuits, schematic
    diagrams, and the code to program the Pi. You can copy the code from the book,
    or you can go to *[https://www.nostarch.com/RaspberryPiProject/](https://www.nostarch.com/RaspberryPiProject/)*
    and download it.

- en: Your Pi learning shouldn’t be restricted to the projects in this book, and that’s
    why all projects have a “Taking it Further” section where we offer suggestions
    for developing your projects further and combining concepts learned throughout
    the book to build more complicated and interesting things. We hope that by the
    end of the book you’ll have the necessary skills to bring your own project ideas
    to life.

- en: The projects in this book were designed using the Raspberry Pi 3 board. If you
    have an older model of the Pi board, you can still follow along, but projects
    will be easiest to build with a Raspberry Pi 3\. Older versions have lower performance
    and *really* old versions have fewer GPIO pins.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We don’t know when or if a Raspberry Pi 4 will be released, but so far all Raspberry
    Pi releases have been compatible with older boards, so future versions should
    also be compatible with the projects in this book.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most of the projects in this book involve using the Pi to interact with the
    outside world using circuits. This means that besides the Raspberry Pi, you’ll
    also need some electronics components. At the beginning of each project, we provide
    a list of the required parts as well as an indication of the cost of the components
    and an estimated time for the build. Projects with one $ symbol will likely cost
    less than $10 in components, while projects with two $ symbols may be between
    $10 and $50 (this is a wide range, but the components’ prices vary depending on
    where you buy them). You can also refer to the “Project Component List” on [page
    9](ch00.xhtml#page_9), which is a complete list of all the components needed for
    this book if you want to buy them all at once.

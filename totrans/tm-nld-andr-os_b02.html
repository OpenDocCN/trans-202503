<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">I</span>n the course of writing this book, I read many books, articles, docs, websites, and anything else that I could find that related to Android, other mobile technology, or just tech history in general. Here are some of the more useful and memorable resources I enjoyed.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680b02-0001">Stuff about Android</h2>
<p class="Reference">“The (updated) history of Android,” <em>Ars Technica</em>, by Ron Amadeo (<a class="LinkURL" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/10/building-android-a-40000-word-history-of-googles-mobile-os/">https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/10/building-android-a-40000-word-history-of-googles-mobile-os/</a>): This multi-part series of articles covers every release of Android from 1.0, detailing the user-visible changes in apps, devices, and the UI. One of the best parts is all the screenshots, because you can’t even get them anymore (even if you have one of the old devices, chances are it doesn’t talk to the same services anymore).</p>
<p class="Reference">“An Android Retrospective,” a presentation by Romain Guy and Chet Haase (<a class="LinkURL" href="https://youtu.be/xOccHEgIvwY">https://youtu.be/xOccHEgIvwY</a>): My friend Romain and I gave this presentation several times at different developer events, where we talked about some of the internal details of how things were developed and what it looked like from the inside of the team.</p>
<p class="Reference"><em>Android Developers Backstage</em>, podcast by Chet Haase, Romain Guy, and Tor Norbye (<a class="LinkURL" href="https://adbackstage.libsyn.com/">https://adbackstage.libsyn.com/</a>): This is a podcast that I host with my friends and Android colleagues Romain and Tor. I mention it because, while it is mostly a podcast by and for developers, there are some episodes along the way that are more about the history of Android. In particular, we spoke with Ficus Kirkpatrick (episode 56), Mathias Agopian (episode 74), Dave Burke (episode 107), and Dan Bornstein (episode 156) about some of the old days that I talk about in the book. My favorite part of writing this book was the conversations I had along the way with the people on the team; these episodes offer a glimpse into what some of those conversations were like.</p>
<p class="Reference"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_382" title="382"/><em>Modern Operating Systems</em>, 4th<em> </em>edition, by Andrew S. Tanenbaum and Herbert Bos (Pearson, 2014): For anyone who felt that the level of technical depth about Android OS internals was lacking, I recommend picking up this textbook on OS design and digging into Chapter 10.8 on Android. That chapter was written by Dianne Hackborn and covers things like Binder and Linux Extensions in a satisfying level of detail that I felt was out of scope for a book that was already bordering on too technical and too long.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680b02-0002">Mobile Technology Case Studies</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Several excellent books cover the history of some of the phone platforms and mobile companies that didn’t fare as well during this time period. I particularly enjoyed these two:</p>
<p class="Reference"><em>Losing the Signal: The Untold Story Behind the Extraordinary Rise and Spectacular Fall of </em><em>BlackBerry</em> by Jacquie McNish and Sean Silcoff (Flatiron Books, 2015).</p>
<p class="Reference"><em>Operation Elop: The Final Years of </em><em>Nokia’s Mobile Phones</em> by Merina Salminen and Pekka Nykänen: The original Finnish book <em>Operaatio Elop</em> was never published in English, but a crowd-sourced effort resulted in an English translation in PDF and other formats, which are available online at <a class="LinkURL" href="https://asokan.org/operation-elop/">https://asokan.org/operation-elop/</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680b02-0003">Silicon Valley Tech History</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">There are also many great books and documentaries about tech history, including these which I really enjoyed:</p>
<p class="Reference"><em>Revolution in The Valley: The Insanely Great Story of How the Mac </em><em>Was Made</em> by Andy Hertzfeld (O’Reilly Media, 2004): This is a wonderful book for understanding how one of the canonical pieces of Silicon Valley history came to be. It’s also a great look into the people and the team behind that project.</p>
<p class="Reference"><em>Steve Jobs</em> by Walter Isaacson (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2011): I enjoyed this book not only for its interesting portrayal of Mr. Jobs, but also (even more) for the history of Silicon Valley and high tech that it told along the way.</p>
<p class="Reference"><em>General Magic</em> (documentary) directed by Sarah Kerruish and Matt Maude: The movie gives a close look into the culture and vision of a company that might have been one of the early successes in mobile computing, except that they were at least 10 years too early.</p>

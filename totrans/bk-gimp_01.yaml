- en: When the idea for this book began to take form in the beginning of 2006, we
    imagined finishing it in 2010 and covering GIMP 3.0\. The first goal was nearly
    met for the French edition—that was under our control—but GIMP 3.0 is still far
    off because volunteer developers can work only when they have time to do so. Still,
    GIMP 2.8 is a great leap forward compared to the previous version, GIMP 2.6\.
    Some of the most noteworthy new features include a single-window interface; completely
    revised and more powerful brush dynamics; clarification of saving versus exporting
    images; improved handling of dockable dialogs; support for layer groups; the ability
    to lock pixels, channels, and paths; an improved Free Select tool; support for
    selecting and tagging multiple objects in resource lists (brushes, gradients,
    and palettes); a new Text tool with on-canvas editing capabilities; a large set
    of new brushes, brush dynamics, and tool presets; and many other features that
    make the program easier and more enjoyable to use. GIMP still lacks nondestructive
    editing, CMYK native support, and 16-bit depth color handling. Some of these features
    will likely appear in the next version, with support from the Generic Graphic
    Library (GEGL).

- en: 'This book aims to fulfill two different purposes: to provide hands-on, task-oriented
    GIMP tutorials and to provide a comprehensive reference manual. Because these
    two goals are distinct, we designed the book in two parts. In the first part,
    eight independent chapters will walk you through the main tasks you can perform
    using GIMP. Each chapter begins with a hands-on tutorial and ends with exercises
    that reinforce the concepts covered.'

- en: You might want to start with [Appendix A](apa.html "Appendix A. Vision and Image
    Representation"), which explains the theory behind image representation, and [Chapter 1](ch01.html
    "Chapter 1. Getting Started"), which helps you to start using GIMP, but you can
    read the other chapters in any order. For example, if you are mainly interested
    in photo manipulation, read [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Photograph Retouching")
    and [Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Composite Photography"). If you are more
    interested in graphic design, read [Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Drawing and
    Illustration") and [Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Logos and Textures"). And
    if you read all the tutorial chapters in order, you’ll have a solid grasp of most
    aspects of GIMP.

- en: The final 14 chapters constitute a thorough GIMP reference manual. We tried
    to cover all aspects in a logical order, using as many examples and illustrations
    as possible. We also tried to avoid explaining the same thing several times. Of
    course, topics overlap between the two parts, but we tried to keep repetition
    to a minimum and, when it was unavoidable, to explain things in a new way.

- en: The chapters in the second part are arranged in a logical order, but, because
    this part is intended as a reference manual, you certainly do not need to read
    the chapters in order. We’ve included cross-references to help you find what you
    need to move your project forward. Some of the chapters in the second part correspond
    directly with a chapter from the first part. In those cases, we recommend that
    you first read the tutorial chapter and then refer to the relevant chapter(s)
    in the second part of the book. These paired chapters include 3 and 15, and 6
    and 18\. Additionally, [Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. The GIMP Interface")
    to [Chapter 14](ch14.html "Chapter 14. Masks") present some basic concepts that
    are used regularly in later chapters.

- en: 'We used a bleeding-edge, developmental version of GIMP to ensure that everything
    was up-to-date as of the book’s completion, and we’ve covered every aspect of
    GIMP as thoroughly as possible, with the exception of the tools in the second
    half of the **Image: Create** menu and those in the **Image: Filters > Alpha to
    logo** menu. We chose not to cover those tools because they’re self-explanatory
    and have only a few parameters.'

- en: We struggled with the decision of whether to cover the many plug-ins and scripts
    that users have added to GIMP. Many of them would require an entire long chapter
    of their own. We decided to cover only one addition, the plug-in set called GIMP
    Animation Package (GAP), because it adds a powerful capability that GIMP alone
    lacks. In [Chapter 21](ch21.html "Chapter 21. Scripts and Plug-ins"), we mention
    a few additional plug-ins to give readers an idea of what’s available.

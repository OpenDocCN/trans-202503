- en: THROUGHOUT THIS BOOK, I’VE SHOWN YOU HOW TO RUN YOUR ROBOT’S PROGRAMS USING
    SIMPLE TERMINAL COMMANDS. WHILE THIS IS GREAT FOR PROTOTYPING, IN THE FUTURE YOU
    MIGHT WANT TO MAKE YOUR ROBOT RUN A PROGRAM AS SOON AS YOU TURN IT ON, WITHOUT
    HAVING TO ACCESS IT REMOTELY. YOU CAN DO THIS EASILY BY EDITING THE RC.LOCAL CONFIGURATION
    FILE.

- en: When you power on your Raspberry Pi, it goes through a boot process. When the
    boot process ends, your Pi looks to the *rc.local* file for any last commands
    or code to execute. By adding your own custom Python command, you can make any
    of the programs from this book run on startup. Here’s how!

- en: First, make sure the program you want to run on startup is complete and working
    the way you want it to. It’s much better to go through the programming, editing,
    and debugging process in the terminal rather than wait to see if the program runs
    when you power on your Pi. This approach will save you from turning your Pi on
    and off all the time.

    user privileges so you can save changes you make to the file; otherwise, they’ll
    just disappear!

    0`. This is where you can add any commands you want your Raspberry Pi to execute
    on startup. No matter what you add, you must leave `exit 0` unedited at the very
    bottom of the file.

    and your program. Also, make sure to add the ampersand symbol `(&)` onto the end
    of the command so that your program doesn’t stop your Raspberry Pi from continuing
    to boot.

    by a Raspberry Pi minicomputer and then program it using Python, the world’s most
    popular programming language. Gradually, you’ll improve your robot by adding increasingly
    advanced functionality until it can follow lines, avoid obstacles, and even recognize

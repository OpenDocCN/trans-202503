<p class="noindent">Frank, Socks, and Officer Notation huddled by the back gate of the prison’s outer wall. Despite its truly impressive coating of rust, the locked gate had resisted both of Frank’s attempts to kick it open. He had only succeeded in clouding the air with red dust and introducing Notation to at least six new Boolean curse words.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“So . . . that didn’t work,” supplied Socks. Frank ignored him and studied the locking mechanism. It was a standard carved keypad with buttons labeled 1, 2, 3, A, B, and C in a single ordered row and an <small>ENTER</small> button beneath.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0071-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">“We’ll have to do this the old-fashioned way,” said Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Wasn’t kicking down the gate the old-fashioned way?” asked Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank ignored her as well. “Socks, do you know any magic lock-picking spells?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“No,” Socks protested loudly. “Those are illegal!”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“How about something to weaken the lock? Or maybe the hinges?” asked Frank.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_72"/><img src="../images/f0072-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">“You want me to help you destroy property?” Socks looked aghast. “That’s worse than lock picking. Do you know how much trouble—”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Search spells, then? The Spell of All Combinations or the Spell of Breadth-First Search?” Notation interrupted. She’d heard enough on the topic of proper and improper spellwork after Frank had casually inquired about the feasibility of replication spells on gold coins—a use of magic that fell firmly on the wrong side of both Socks’s and her own ethical line.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I’ve used the Spell of Breadth-First Search a few times,” Socks answered. “My real expertise is binary search trees, but I’m familiar with a range of computational techniques. Once I—”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Will breadth-first search work on the lock?” interrupted Frank. Over the years, Frank had worked cases with a handful of wizards of varying levels of respectability. He’d seen at least a dozen different lock-picking spells but had never seen a door opened with an explicit breadth-first search.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notation smiled. “Definitely! It’s a bit abstract, but I saw a similar problem recently in my Police Algorithms course. When you think about it, a code lock is just a search problem; you enter a string of characters to open it. The search space is all possible strings that can be made from those characters. Every string is a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_73"/>valid search option, from a single character like 1 or A to complex sequences like ABC123CBA321. The search target is the one string that opens the lock.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“But we don’t even know how many characters we need,” protested Socks. “The lock could have a 30-character combination.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“That’s why she suggested breadth-first search,” said Frank, thinking aloud as much as addressing Socks’s concern.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I don’t understand,” said Socks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notation quickly picked up the explanation. “You see, breadth-first search expands outward from a starting point, exploring along a frontier of solutions. Naturally it will try the shorter solutions first.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Huh?” asked Socks, now looking confused to the point of panic. “I thought breadth-first search used magic lists. I’ve always used a magic list. Isn’t it just a magic list?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Yes,” agreed Notation. “Breadth-first search maintains a list of options to try next if the current option doesn’t work. The algorithm is basically a loop that keeps pulling options from the front of the list and adding new options to the back. On each iteration, we pick a new option to try from the <em>front</em> of the list. And, if that’s not what we want, we check if there are any new options reachable from the current one and add those unexplored options to the <em>back</em> of the list.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“You start at a single point in the search space, in this case at a password of length zero. Then for each password you try, you add new search possibilities to the end of the list. In this case, each time we try a password, we’ll add all single-character extensions to the list. For example, here we know the password can only contain the characters 1, 2, 3 and A, B, and C. Once we’ve tested 3A, we’ll add 3A1, 3A2, 3A3, 3AA, 3AB, and 3AC to the end of our list.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Socks screwed his face up in concentration, then asked, “How do we know which options to add?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Think of it like a tree of possibilities,” suggested Notation. “Each branch, or <em>node</em>, is a password from our list, like 3A. The neighboring options are the nodes under it—the passwords we would get by <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_74"/>adding one more character to the end. Breadth-first search progresses down each level of the tree before moving onto the next.”</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0074-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Since we add the new, longer passwords to the <em>end</em> of our list, we try all the short stuff first,” Frank threw in. “Now, can you do it?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“This isn’t a proper use of—”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Come on! Really?” interrupted Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“It’s basically a lock-picking spell,” responded Socks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Yes. That’s exactly what it is!” shouted Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Forget it,” said Notation, throwing her arms up in frustration. “If he doesn’t feel comfortable picking the lock, we’re not going to change his mind by yelling.” She turned and studied the stone wall itself, which stood at least 10 feet tall. After a moment she continued, “Frank, if you give me a boost, maybe I can climb over.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank gave the wall a skeptical look. Despite having been abandoned for years, the wall lacked the large cracks and rambling vines that often aid mountaineering efforts on old castle walls. The workmanship was impressive. Someone had taken real pride in building this wall; you could tell from the artistic way the metal spikes twisted as they jutted up. Those little details took effort.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Maybe. It’s pretty high, though, and those spikes look awfully sharp,” he said.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“It’ll be just like the obstacle course at the academy,” said Notation. “Aside from the hard-packed ground, the lack of hand-holds, and the large metal spikes, that is.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Those’ll probably add some excitement,” Frank offered.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Shut up and give me a boost, Frank.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“No. No. I’ll do it,” said Socks hurriedly. “I’ll use the Spell of Breadth-First Search. I’ll need something for the list, though. A roll of parchment, perhaps?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_75"/>Frank and Notation looked at each other. “No can do, kid. Use the ground; it’s muddy enough.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Oh. Yes. Of course.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A few minutes later, the lock began to glow. “Here we go,” said Socks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The word <small>ENTER</small> glowed briefly, followed by a clicking noise. But the gate remained locked. The spell had tried the first password, which was nothing at all. Next a series of numbers and letters appeared in the mud:</p>&#13;
<div class="blockquote">&#13;
<p class="noindent">1, 2, 3, A, B, C</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank could picture the tree of possible passwords that the list represented.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0075-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">An instant later, the number 1 glowed, followed by <small>ENTER</small>. Again the gate clicked, but didn’t open. The list on the ground changed, showing the new list of passwords to try, branching out to the third level of the tree.</p>&#13;
<div class="blockquote">&#13;
<p class="noindent">2, 3, A, B, C</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">11, 12, 13, 1A, 1B, 1C</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">But these were added to the end of the list. The search itself continued on the current level, trying 2.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0075-02.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_76"/>The password 2 didn’t work, and the list grew again.</p>&#13;
<div class="blockquote">&#13;
<p class="noindent">3, A, B, C</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">11, 12, 13, 1A, 1B, 1C</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">21, 22, 23, 2A, 2B, 2C</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Again the tree branched out with new possibilities, but the search still worked its way along the current level, trying all one-character passwords before moving deeper.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0076-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">In other words, the search explored the full breadth of each level before moving on to deeper levels.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0076-02.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">The search finished the first level, trying the passwords 3, A, B, and C, before Socks broke the silence. “This could take a while.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank nodded, eyes fixed on the ever-growing list of numbers. “Notation, why don’t you scout around the front?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_77"/>“Okay,” she agreed, her expression betraying great relief. Rookies didn’t tend to handle stakeouts well. Sitting still for hours on end with nothing to do wasn’t something you could teach at the academy, although Professor Cloud’s Philosophy of Law Enforcement lectures came close.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Five minutes after Notation left, the lock gave a loud click, and the gate swung open noisily on its well-rusted hinges. The list in the mud faded as the search algorithm completed.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“1111,” said Frank, without a trace of surprise. It often paid to keep the codes simple enough for the henchmen to remember.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">He used a stick to write the code in a patch of mud and circled it twice. Even a rookie couldn’t miss the message. Then he turned to Socks. “Let’s go.”</p>&#13;
<div class="sidebar">&#13;
<p class="sidebart"><strong>POLICE ALGORITHMS 101: BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="sbsub"><em><strong>Excerpt from Professor Drecker’s Lecture</strong></em></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Breadth-first search is an algorithm that explores search states in the order in which they are encountered. In other words, it always attempts to explore the oldest unsearched state first.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can visualize breadth-first search as keeping a list (or, more formally, a <em>queue</em>) of known but unexplored states. At each step, the algorithm picks the next state to explore from the front of the queue. As the algorithm discovers new options, it adds them to the back of the queue, to make sure all previous options are explored before it moves on to new options.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">It’s helpful to describe breadth-first search in terms of how it explores a graph. A graph is a data structure composed of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_78"/>individual <em>nodes</em>, with <em>edges</em> linking those nodes. If two nodes are connected by an edge, we say they are <em>neighbors</em>, which means you can move between those nodes. During your orientation, you studied at least one graph—the Kingdom Highway Map. This map represents each city as a node and the highways connecting them as edges. Make sure you own a good copy of that map. Criminals have a tendency to flee the city, and you’ll need to know to which neighboring cities they are most likely to go.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Searching the Kingdom Highway Map is a classic graph search problem. Our search states are the nodes of the graph—the cities on the map. Imagine that a crime has occurred in city A and it is your job to find the fleeing criminal.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0078-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Breadth-first search explores along an expanding frontier, checking each node <em>X</em> steps away from the initial node before proceeding to any nodes <em>X</em> + 1 steps away. After you explore city A, its two neighbors, B and D, are added to the back of the queue. No other cities were in the queue, so B is the next city you’ll visit.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0078-02.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_79"/>If each node has many neighbors, maintaining the queue of nodes to explore can use a large amount of memory. This memory requirement can become expensive in large search problems. As an officer, you’ll want to invest in a number of good notebooks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">At each step in breadth-first search, we test whether the current node is the target node. In this example, that means thoroughly checking the city for our criminal. If the current node isn’t the target node, we add only its previously unseen neighbors to the list. (A node that is <em>unseen</em> hasn’t been added to the list yet.) We thus avoid adding either nodes that we have already explored or unexplored nodes that are already on our list. In this case, for instance, after checking city B, we would not add A to our list again.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0079-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Note that checking whether a neighbor is unseen requires even more memory because we must keep track of previously seen nodes. However, the benefit is significant—we avoid loops through previously explored nodes. Again, carefully keeping track of your search can pay off significantly.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0079-02.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_80"/><img src="../images/f0080-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">In this particular example, we find our suspect hiding in city H. We can stop our search there and make the arrest.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In search problems where moving between any two neighboring nodes has the same cost (time, energy, etc.), breadth-first search is guaranteed to find a path with the least total cost. It accomplishes this by expanding outward from the starting node, exploring <em>every</em> node that is <em>X</em> steps away before exploring any state that is <em>X</em> + 1 steps away.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0080-02.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Breadth-first search can even be adapted to return the shortest path by keeping <em>back pointers</em>. Each node keeps track of the node that preceded it. Then, upon finding the goal state, you can trace the pointers backward to re-create the path.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_81"/>However, keep in mind that this works only if each move between neighbors has the same cost. In the general case, minimizing the number of steps in the search space can be very different from minimizing the cost of the path to the goal. For example, if hikers want to minimize their energy expended (cost), they would prefer a longer route that avoids crossing a mountain range. While the mountain pass would be shorter, and arguably more scenic, it could require significantly more energy.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_82"/></p>&#13;

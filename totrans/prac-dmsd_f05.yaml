- en: 'This isn’t my first book, but it’s by far my most unusual. For one, I don’t
    fit the typical profile for the disaster preparedness genre. I’m not a grizzled
    ex-military survivalist, nor a peddler of gold bullion, nor a doomsday prognosticator
    convinced that the world around us is going to hell. Nothing of the sort: I’m
    an unassuming, city-raised computer nerd.'

- en: In a way, the book in front of you is simply a product of circumstance. I grew
    up in communist Poland, a once-proud nation razed to the ground in the final days
    of World War II, then subjugated by Stalin and unceremoniously subsumed into the
    Soviet Bloc. I remember childhood tales of distant relatives vanishing without
    a trace, and I recall long lines and ration cards for basic necessities like sugar
    and soap. Later, when I came to the United States, I lived through the dot-com
    crash of the early 2000s, and then through the housing crisis of 2007 to 2009\.
    I watched friends go from earning cozy six-figure salaries to having their cars
    and homes repossessed. I kept telling myself this would never happen to me—all
    the way until, through a stroke of bad luck, I almost ended up on the street.

- en: In the end, my fascination with emergency preparedness isn’t rooted in a mean
    militaristic streak or a bleak outlook on life; it stems from a simple realization
    that disasters aren’t rare today, just as they weren’t rare in days gone by. We
    all have friends or relatives who have experienced financial hardships or had
    to escape wildfires, earthquakes, hurricanes, or floods—but we invariably imagine
    ourselves safe from such calamities. Moments later, we open history books and
    read about thousands of years of brutal conflict, conquest, plague, and war, with
    only fleeting decades of prosperity and calm in between. We know about all this,
    and yet we convince ourselves that nothing of the sort could ever happen again—not
    here, not now, not to us.

- en: Still, the goal of this book isn’t to convince you that the end is nigh and
    let that thought consume your life. On the contrary, I want to reclaim the concept
    of prepping from the hands of the bunker-dwelling prophets of doom. Prepping shouldn’t
    be about expecting the apocalypse; it should be about enjoying life to the fullest
    without having to worry about what’s in the news. Such is the power of having
    a solid and well-reasoned backup plan.

- en: Another way in which this book differs from others is that from the beginning
    of the project, I wanted to teach a thought process, rather than write down a
    rigid set of axioms, a list of investments to make, or a collection of items to
    buy. We all come from different backgrounds and have different life goals; it
    follows that there’s no one solution that fits all. The future is unknowable too,
    so not every approach that sounds good on paper is guaranteed to pay off down
    the line. The ability to reason through unforeseen problems can be worth more
    than even the most remarkable stash of survival gear.

- en: Ultimately, my goal is to equip readers with a healthy mix of data, opinions,
    and interesting anecdotes. Far from being gospel, the book is merely a starting
    point for you to conduct your own personally relevant research. This, in turn,
    should help you make your own decisions that not only prepare you for potential
    adversities that might await in your life—but more important, help you sleep well
    at night when everybody else is worried sick.

<p class="ChapterIntroContinued">In this chapter, you’ll see how bias is sometimes introduced intentionally to influence the answers that an ML system gives. You’ll create an app that recommends movies to people based on the sort of films that they like. But you’ll train your model in a way that lets you affect the recommendations. </p>

<p>I want my recommendation app to help people find classic movies, so I chose three films from the 1920s, as shown in <a id="figureanchor15-1" href="#figure15-1">Figure 15-1</a>, but you can choose newer movies for your project.</p>

<h3 id="h2-500563c15-0005">Test Your Biased Project</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Try testing your project again. You should find that it has a preference for the new fourth movie, particularly over the one that’s similar to it. </p>
<p>For my project, that means if I mention anything about scary films, getting my heart racing or my adrenaline pumping, or monsters, my ML model will always recommend <em>Frankenstein</em> now—not <em>Nosferatu</em> as it did before. It isn’t balanced between sometimes recommending one and sometimes the other. It seems to have a preference, or a bias, toward <em>Frankenstein</em>. In fact, it’s difficult to get it to recommend <em>Nosferatu</em> at all unless I type a sentence exactly like one of my training examples.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="247" id="Page_247"/>Experiment with your project to see how it performs. Every ML model behaves a little differently, so try to get a feel for how the one you’ve trained is working.</p>
<h2 id="h1-500563c15-0002">Review Your Project</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">We talked in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 8">Chapter 8</span> about ways to measure the performance of an ML model, such as <em>precision</em><em/> and <em>recall</em><em/>. If you calculate some of these values before and after you intentionally bias your ML model, you can measure how bias impacts your project.</p>
<p>When you think you’ve identified the way your ML model is behaving, the next step is to understand why. Look at <a href="#figure15-13">Figure 15-13</a> again. Why is my ML model recommending <em>Frankenstein</em> more often?</p>
<p>When you collect training examples, you’re asking the computer to identify patterns in those examples, which it uses to learn to recognize new samples in the future. The number of examples you put in each bucket is one area where the computer looks for patterns. By putting many more examples in the <em>Frankenstein</em> training bucket, I influenced the ML model in a way that went beyond the individual training examples. </p>
<p>Say you’re teaching a child to recommend movies. Imagine you tell them 5 times that they should recommend Movie A, and 1,000 times you tell them that they should recommend Movie B. What impact would that have on their expectations? If you tell them over and over again that the right answer is Movie B, they’ll probably learn that the movie they should recommend is almost always Movie B. </p>
<p>This is similar to the way ML systems behave. The computer looks for patterns in all of your training examples in many, many ways. Your training tells it which of those ways it should trust more than others. If the training examples tell it over and over again that the patterns, techniques, and processes that tend to result in the answer Movie B are correct, it learns to trust those patterns, techniques, and processes. If the training examples tell it over and over again that the patterns, techniques, and processes that result in the answer Movie A are wrong, it learns not to trust them. </p>
<p>Even if it identifies patterns, techniques, and processes that result in the answer Movie A in the future, your training examples have trained it not to trust them and to prefer instead those that suggest Movie B.  </p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="248" id="Page_248"/>As you have seen, the amount of training data in each bucket is an important factor in creating ML systems. An imbalance in the number of training examples in the different buckets can result in what we call a <em>biased</em> system.</p>
<h2 id="h1-500563c15-0003">The Case for Bias</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">In most of the projects in this book so far, we’ve tried to keep the number of training examples in each bucket roughly the same. This is a common principle in many ML projects in an attempt to minimize bias.</p>
<p>But while bias is an important factor to keep in mind, it’s not necessarily always a bad thing. </p>
<p>Say you’re training a computer to recognize the difference between three possible outcomes: X, Y, and Z. Imagine that X and Y are very common; they are almost always the right answer. Outcome Z is possible, but it’s very, very rare. Even though Z hardly ever happens, you want to train the computer to be able to recognize it when it does. </p>
<p>A balanced set of training examples, with the same number of examples for X, Y, and Z, might not be appropriate here. Having more training examples for X and Y, and fewer for Z, might train the ML model that X and Y are more likely, and in this case that’s correct. Outcomes X and Y <em>are</em><b> </b>more common, and Z is rare. Such a system would still be biased, but the bias reflects the statistical likelihood of the different outcomes, and so it might actually be appropriate and helpful. </p>
<h2 id="h1-500563c15-0004">AI and Ethics</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Throughout this chapter, we’ve seen that the training you provide to an ML system will strongly influence the answers that it gives. What do you think this means for the responsibilities of the people who create AI systems? Do you think AI developers have an ethical responsibility to balance their training data or to avoid creating biased systems?</p>
<p>Does intention make a difference? If someone accidentally develops a biased system, is this more or less ethical than someone who wanted to influence the output of their system and intentionally skewed their training data?</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="249" id="Page_249"/>Does money make a difference? In other words, if the producer of my fourth movie paid me lots of money to make my movie recommendation app prefer their movie over their competitors’ movies, would this be more or less ethical than me making a biased app that wouldn’t personally benefit me?</p>
<p>Does the subject make a difference? In other words, do you think that a biased AI movie recommendation app is less of an ethical concern than an AI app that makes medical treatment recommendations to doctors? </p>
<p>Imagine an ML recommendation app that recommends which medicines should be prescribed to patients. Each training bucket is a type of medicine, and the training examples it contains are medical records of patients for whom that medicine was the best treatment. Systems like this are in use today. ML systems can learn to recognize patterns in massive numbers of detailed medical records and combine this with evidence extracted from equally massive amounts of medical research and literature. It’s still early days for this sort of medical AI assistant application, but usage is going to increase significantly in the next few years. </p>
<p>Now that you’ve seen for yourself how easy it is for such a system to be influenced to prefer one answer over another, does this affect your opinion of how such systems are used? In theory, it’s possible that the manufacturer of one drug could reward the developers of a medical AI application for biasing their ML model to prefer that drug over drugs from other manufacturers. </p>
<p>We are increasingly relying on ML systems to make important decisions that affect people’s lives. It’s not just in healthcare, either. ML systems make financial recommendations that banks and loan companies use to determine whether someone should be offered insurance, whether they can get a loan, or what interest rate they should be charged. ML systems will soon be driving the cars and trucks on our roads. And there are many more examples.</p>
<p>Forcing companies to be transparent and disclose how their ML systems are trained might be one way to protect against ethical problems. But you’ve seen how much effort is involved in preparing training data. Companies invest a lot of time and money in the training data they collect to make their ML systems better than those of their competitors, so many prefer to keep their training data secret. How would you balance these ethics issues with the commercial interests of companies?</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="250" id="Page_250"/>Do you think protections are needed over how AI systems are trained or applied? If so, should AI ethics policies be developed by individual companies or by the government?</p>
<p>This chapter is ending with more questions than answers, and this reflects the current state of ethics in AI. ML systems have the potential to improve all of our lives by training computers to do things that we couldn’t do otherwise. However, as a society, we need to address a number of questions about how comfortable we are applying this technology.</p>
<h2 id="h1-500563c15-0005">What You Learned</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">In this final project, you built on your knowledge of bias from <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 14">Chapter 14</span> and created an ML model for a movie recommendation app that preferred one result over the others. You saw that having an imbalance in the number of examples used to train an ML model is another way to intentionally introduce bias into a system. You also learned that bias isn’t necessarily bad—and in some cases may even be appropriate—but it’s important to be aware of the ethical issues surrounding it, especially as AI systems become more common.</p>

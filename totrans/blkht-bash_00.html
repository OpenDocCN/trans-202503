<p class="COS">What if the world’s most potent cyberweapon wasn’t a zero-day exploit but the oldest trick in the book? In this fast-evolving cybersecurity landscape, bash scripting has remained a foundational skill, providing much more than just a convenient way to interact with an operating system.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Written by Brian Fox in 1989, the bash shell is used on most versions of the Linux operating system, which runs an impressive share of the world’s infrastructure. You’ll find Linux across the vast network of servers that form the backbone of the internet, as well as orchestrating space missions, enabling secure financial transactions, and driving innovation in artificial intelligence.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Linux’s ubiquity has made bash scripting an essential skill for hackers hoping to master the art of <i>living off the land</i>, or using a system’s native tools and processes to execute attacks, which can enable them to blend in with legitimate activities and avoid detection. If penetration testers rely too <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xx" aria-label="xx"/>heavily on an ever-growing arsenal of third-party tools, they’ll struggle to operate in restricted environments with limited tool access.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Bash scripting also enables hackers to automate the execution of command line tools. For example, it lets them chain multiple tools together, run them against many targets, or strategically schedule their execution. By writing scripts, hackers can develop powerful, efficient penetration-testing routines that fit their custom needs.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Whether you’re a penetration tester, a bug bounty hunter, a student taking your first steps into the field of cybersecurity, or a defender hoping to understand attacker techniques, this book will teach you to harness bash scripting at all stages of an offensive security engagement. You’ll learn how to write reusable offensive scripts, use the bash shell to maneuver through networks, and dive deep inside the Linux operating system.</p>&#13;

<h2 class="H1" id="sec1"><span id="h1-2"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">What Is in This Book</span></h2>&#13;
<p class="TNI1">This book begins by teaching you the foundations of bash syntax and scripting. It then applies those skills to each stage of a penetration test against a Linux-based target network, from initial access to data exfiltration. Along the way, you’ll explore the Linux operating system and enhance your bash hacking skills.</p>&#13;
<p class="RunInPara1"><b><a href="chapter1.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>: Bash Basics </b>Provides a high-level overview of bash syntax, including assigning variables, using arithmetic operators, handling input and exit codes, and much more.</p>&#13;
<p class="RunInPara"><b><a href="chapter2.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>: Flow Control and Text Processing </b>Covers more advanced bash concepts, such as testing conditions, using loops, consolidating code into functions, and sending commands to the background. You’ll also learn some ways of customizing your bash environment for penetration testing.</p>&#13;
<p class="RunInPara"><b><a href="chapter3.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>: Setting Up a Hacking Lab </b>Walks you through building a lab to use throughout the rest of the book. You’ll rely on Kali Linux and a vulnerable Docker-based target environment to practice your bash hacking.</p>&#13;
<p class="RunInPara"><b><a href="chapter4.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>: Reconnaissance </b>Covers reconnaissance activities against a network from a black box point of view. You’ll combine hacking tools with bash scripting to automate information gathering.</p>&#13;
<p class="RunInPara"><b><a href="chapter5.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>: Vulnerability Scanning and Fuzzing </b>Explores ways of using bash to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. You’ll learn to write bash scripts for scanning and fuzzing tasks, crucial steps in any penetration test.</p>&#13;
<p class="RunInPara"><b><a href="chapter6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>: Gaining a Web Shell </b>Dives into techniques for gaining a low-privileged foothold on a target system, with a particular focus on deploying web shells and performing OS command injections. You’ll also uncover various ways to upgrade limited shell environments, setting up a foundation for future attacks.</p>&#13;
<p class="RunInPara"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xxi" aria-label="xxi"/><b><a href="chapter7.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>: Reverse Shells </b>Covers the establishment of reverse shells, an initial access technique that swaps the direction of the connection to remote servers. You’ll learn the theory behind how reverse shells work, then leverage them to gain stable access to a remote machine.</p>&#13;
<p class="RunInPara"><b><a href="chapter8.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>: Local Information Gathering </b>Explores ways of gathering information from a compromised Linux host without sending any packets across the network that could give your activities away. You’ll navigate the Linux file directory and permissions system, collect information about user sessions, explore installed software, and much more.</p>&#13;
<p class="RunInPara"><b><a href="chapter9.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>: Privilege Escalation </b>Discusses potential paths to privilege escalation, such as misconfigured permissions, shared resources, and other flaws.</p>&#13;
<p class="RunInPara"><b><a href="chapter10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>: Persistence </b>Explores ways of making your access to a network resilient to environmental changes. You’ll steal credentials, modify service configurations, and more.</p>&#13;
<p class="RunInPara"><b><a href="chapter11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>: Network Probing and Lateral Movement </b>Discusses living-off-the-land approaches to reaching other servers on the target network.</p>&#13;
<p class="RunInPara2"><b><a href="chapter12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>: Defense Evasion and Exfiltration </b>Covers defensive security controls commonly seen in corporate environments. You’ll learn how to tamper with security tools and exfiltrate information from a system in evasive ways.</p>&#13;

<h2 class="H1" id="sec2"><span id="h1-3"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">The Scripting Exercises</span></h2>&#13;
<p class="TNI1">Throughout the chapters, 29 exercises prompt you to practice your newfound bash scripting skills. Some walk you through complete scripts, then encourage you to expand or improve upon them; others challenge you to write your own scripts from the ground up. Using bash, you’ll do exercises such as the following:</p>&#13;
<ul class="ul">&#13;
<li class="ListBullet">Organize the results of a scan by port number (<span class="listbullet_Xref"><a href="chapter4.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>)</span></li>&#13;

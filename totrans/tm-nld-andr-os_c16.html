<h2 id="h1-502680c16-0001">Irina Blok and the Android Mascot</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">One of the most recognizable aspects of the Android operating system is the green robot mascot, designed by Irina Blok:</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="g16001" src="image_fi/502680c16/g16001.png"/></figure>

<p>Although this logo has come to represent Android worldwide, it was originally intended just for developers. Irina said, “The objective was to create excitement in the developer community and create something that was very much like a Linux penguin.”</p>
<p>There were not many constraints on the design project. The Android team came to Irina’s internal branding team and made a request. They said the name of the product was Android, and they wanted a compelling launch story. They suggested making it look human, and wanted something that would get developers excited. </p>
<p>Irina spent about a week coming up with various ideas before submitting the final design.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_160" title="160"/><figure>

</figure>
<p>Note that the black logos seen in the sketch sheet are not “black” as much as they are colorless; black is just a neutral color she was using while she iterated on early shapes and ideas. You can see the A for Android incorporated into many of the ideas (though not the final one). You can also see that there is a black version of the final logo, in the center bottom of early designs. That’s close to where the design ended up (with the addition of two antennae), but Irina remembers it as one of her first ideas.</p>
<p>One of the important elements in the final design was the shape itself. “The logo was inspired by an international symbol. There is a very simple symbol of a human. I tried to come up with the equivalent symbol for Android.” Irina had worked with ideas of pictograms for other branding projects, which were powerful because of “how people see pictograms and signs and how they can communicate without words. They’re so simple and they communicate across all cultures.”</p>
<p>Irina also strove for simplicity: “Since the logo was meant to be a blueprint, the shape itself couldn’t be too intricate.”</p>
<p><em>Blueprint</em> refers to another aspect of the final design: it was released into open source and developers were encouraged to use it and to create variations on that theme: “It could be decorated differently. That’s what this logo system is.”</p>
<p>There are a couple of elements about how the mascot was released that made her blueprint system work. One was that the bugdroid<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c16-footnote-1" id="c16-footnoteref-1">1</a></sup> is explicitly licensed for reuse, under a Creative Commons license. On the Android brand <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_161" title="161"/>guidelines site, it says, “The green Android robot can be reproduced and/or modified as long as the following Creative Commons attribution line is included. . . .”</p>
<p>This license gives anyone the right to use and modify the robot. But if it were just a small JPEG file, it wouldn’t lead to very interesting variations. That’s where the second part of the strategy kicks in: The logo was released in multiple file formats that lend themselves to redesign. First of all, there is a high-resolution version in the PNG format with a transparent background. But if you really want to modify the image, you’ll want one of the other <em>vector</em> formats (EPS, SVG, and AI), which allow you to work directly with the robot’s geometry.</p>
<p>Making the robot freely usable was revolutionary. Irina spoke about more traditional approaches of branding: “Identity comes in brand guidelines, which is a really giant book with restrictions: ‘Here’s a clear space around the logo. Here are the colors. . . . ’ The logo is sacred. And this was just completely ripping that traditional notion apart.” This aspect of the logo came not from the Android team itself, but from Irina’s branding group, in response to Android being open sourced: “This was our creative idea to address that. Being a designer, your job is to communicate what the product stands for. That was a revolutionary creative idea at the time. This was not given to us as a constraint; this was our solution, which I think is the best thing about this logo.”</p>
<p>Once the robot was released into the wild, it began to grow outside of Google and Android. “The logo was released as a system and it started to take on a life of its own. It started to be dimensional. You could see statues. It was almost like giving birth to a child and then watching the child grow. It started taking the first step, and then started to talk. Once it moved on, I watched it grow from a distance.”</p>
<p>Once the external community got ahold of the robot, it took on a life way outside of its original target audience of developers: “It was just a developer release. It was never meant to be a consumer-facing logo. It was a small project, focused on developers. But it became so popular that it just grew bigger and bigger and bigger and spread to being consumer-facing.”</p>
<p>It can be difficult to gauge the effectiveness of branding with any product. “Sometimes you can’t really measure the impact of the brand. The brand gives a product personality. And it generates excitement. Because we’re all human, and it’s emotional, and it helps to tell the story, and relate to the brand. This also excites the developers to develop more stuff, and it also excites the consumer.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_162" title="162"/>“Design is everything. Design is how people see a product, what they feel when they use a product. It’s part of why something succeeds and something fails.</p>
<p>“At the time, you don’t think about those things—you just get things done. So it’s very intuitive. You don’t do user research for the logo: you just get it done.”</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c16-0002">Given the Green Light</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">And what about the iconic green color of the original logo? Variations on the robot come in all kinds of colors, but green is the original and the main color associated with it. Irina said, “Green is the original color of code.”</p>
<p>As in, green text on black terminal screens, like the VT100, a callback to programming in the old days (and scenes from the movie <em>The Matrix</em>, which were visual callbacks to the same terminal-coding origin). The logo was always about software.</p>
<p>Along with the final design, Irina sent in some variations, to inspire people to play with it.</p>

</figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_163" title="163"/>“My job was to inspire and try to come up with guidelines for how to use this mark. But not to iterate on what this means to me. Because it’s not about me. It’s about everybody.”</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c16-0003">Jeff Yaksick and UI Design</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The design of Android’s user interface has gone through several contortions and generations over the years, getting progressively more polished and consistent with each effort. But in the beginning, there wasn’t even a single designer, much less a design team or design concept.</p>
<p>Jeff Yaksick was the initial Android design team. He didn’t start on Android until December of 2005, six months after the Android team started at Google, around the time that hiring started ramping up. </p>
<p>Jeff started his career at NeXT Inc., but later moved to WebTV (which was then acquired by Microsoft), where he worked with future Android people including Chris White, Andy Rubin, and Steve Horowitz. After co-founding Android, Chris reached out to Jeff to see if he was interested in joining their startup (which was then focused on a camera OS). But Chris couldn’t promise that a future at Android would be as secure as Jeff’s Microsoft job, so Jeff stayed where he was. Then Google acquired Android in July of 2005 and Jeff joined the Android team that December.</p>
<p>When Jeff started, there wasn’t a lot to design for; the initial Android system was really just coming into being. So he worked on some of the basic visuals, like the look of buttons. And checkboxes. He also worked on color palettes, gradients, and fonts.</p>
<p>“One of the first things, was: What do we use as a font? I looked at all the open source font stuff at the time. The original font that I found wasn’t broad enough for as global as Google intended to be.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c16-footnote-2" id="c16-footnoteref-2">2</a></sup> So I worked with Ascender, a font studio. I helped art-direct the original font for ‘Droid,’ the system font.”</p>

</figure>
<p>Jeff eventually got some help when German Bauer joined, in September of 2006. Jeff and German worked on a wide spectrum of design tasks, from the look of the UI controls to the launcher to the design of the mail and browser applications.</p>
<p>Eventually, since there was a lot of design work necessary for the first release, Andy contracted with The Astonishing Tribe (TAT), a UX design firm in Sweden. TAT designed the overall look of the system and the core experience that shipped with the G1.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c16-footnote-3" id="c16-footnoteref-3">3</a></sup> Jeff and German continued to help out on various apps like Settings, and rounded out the widget set (buttons, checkboxes, and other UI elements) for the system. They also inherited all of TAT’s work when their contract expired.</p>
<p>There was a mad rush in the run-up to 1.0 to re-implement the phone UI. There were some legal constraints about how it had to look and function which required a lot of redesign work without much time left in the schedule. “We scrambled, did a Herculean effort to redesign the phone experience so we could actually ship a phone. I had designed this kind of dark-themed UI with a gradient color: green for connected and red for hung-up. Toward the end, before we shipped, it got a review between Andy Rubin, myself, and Sergey Brin. Brin was notorious about speed, and said, ‘Why do we need gradients? <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_165" title="165"/>They take more processing power.’ I think he’d be happy to have big buttons on the screen, nothing exciting. I had come into Google from Microsoft and I was still kind of new. I didn’t really know that Sergey Brin and Larry Page were kind of running the show. So I was a little snarky to Sergey.”</p>
<p>Bob Lee mentioned this founder-design dynamic as well: “When we were first starting, Larry and Sergey, probably Sergey, insisted on no animations,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c16-footnote-4" id="c16-footnoteref-4">4</a></sup> because they were a waste of time. Which to look at phones now . . . That’s kind of why Android was a little more spartan.”</p>
<p>There was still plenty to do after 1.0, as the system kept evolving. Jeff worked on the early software keyboard experience, which was new after 1.0, since the G1 used only a hardware keyboard in 1.0. The design team also started to grow after 1.0, adding more designers and people to lead that team.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c16-0004">Toys</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">One other thing that Jeff helped out with were Android toys.</p>
<p>Jeff was into <em>urban vinyl</em><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c16-footnote-5" id="c16-footnoteref-5">5</a></sup> toys in those early days coming up to 1.0. He had the idea of producing a toy for Android. Dave Bort, an Android engineer, was friends with Andrew Bell,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c16-footnote-6" id="c16-footnoteref-6">6</a></sup> who ran the artist studio Dead Zebra, Inc. Jeff sent Andrew some ideas of what he was thinking and they worked with Dave and Dan Morrill (on Android’s developer relations team) and made it happen. </p>

</figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_166" title="166"/>From that original toy grew an ongoing series of Android collectible toys. On a regular basis (nearly every year), another set of new designs come out (and then sell out quickly). Jeff contributed three of these designs: Noogler, Racer, and Mecha.</p>

</figure>
<p>The other figurine design that Jeff contributed to was on a slightly different scale: the first lawn statue. As 1.0 was approaching, Andy decided that the Android building on the Google campus needed a statue. Andy knew someone that created foam statues: Giovanni Calabrese, owner of the company Themendous. He connected Jeff with Giovanni, Jeff sent in some designs, and they made it happen. Andy originally asked for a larger statue than was possible, given the realities of transporting it from the studio, so they reduced its size to make it work.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c16-footnote-7" id="c16-footnoteref-7">7</a></sup></p>

</figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_168" title="168"/>Jeff reflected back on Android’s and Google’s design evolution: “When I joined Google, it was probably akin to Microsoft early on, when they started to do Windows 95, and then Vista. At that point, design started to matter. NeXT, Microsoft, Google—they’re all engineering-based companies. It’s always been a challenge to convince engineering that this stuff’s important. I think Apple definitely helped move the needle: Design is important.”</p>

- en: This third edition of *Practical Packet Analysis* was written and edited over
    the course of a year and a half, from late 2015 to early 2017, approximately 6
    years after the second edition’s release and 10 years since publication of the
    original. This book contains a significant amount of new content, with completely
    new capture files and scenarios and an entirely new chapter covering packet analysis
    from the command line with TShark and tcpdump. If you liked the first two editions,
    then you’ll like this one. It’s written in the same tone and breaks down explanations
    in a simple, understandable manner. If you were hesitant to try out the last two
    editions because they didn’t include the latest information on networking or Wireshark
    updates, you’ll want to read this one because of the expanded content on new network
    protocols and updated information on Wireshark 2.*x*.

- en: 'You may find yourself wondering why you should buy this book as opposed to
    any other book about packet analysis. The answer lies in the title: *Practical
    Packet Analysis*. Let’s face it—nothing beats real-world experience, and the closest
    you can come to that experience in a book is through practical examples with real-world
    scenarios.'

- en: The first half of this book gives you the knowledge you’ll need to understand
    packet analysis and Wireshark. The second half of the book is devoted entirely
    to practical cases that you could easily encounter in day-to-day network management.

    officer, a desktop technician, or even a network security analyst, you will benefit
    greatly from understanding and using the packet analysis techniques described
    in this book.

- en: I’m generally a really laid-back guy, so when I teach a concept, I try to do
    so in a really laid-back way. This holds true for the language used in this book.
    It’s easy to get lost in technical jargon, but I’ve tried my best to keep things
    as casual as possible. I’ve defined all the terms and concepts clearly and without
    any added fluff. After all, I’m from the great state of Kentucky, so I try to
    keep the big words to a minimum. (But you’ll have to forgive me for some of the
    backwoods country verbiage you’ll find throughout the text.)

- en: The first several chapters are integral to understanding the rest of the book,
    so make it a point to master the concepts in these pages first. The second half
    of the book is purely practical. You may not see these exact scenarios in your
    workplace, but you will be able to apply the concepts they teach in the situations
    you do encounter.

    interface and interact with a packet on the command line. This new chapter shows
    you how to use TShark and tcpdump, the two best command line packet analysis tools
    for the job.

    TCP and UDP. The majority of packets you look at will use one of these two protocols,
    so understanding what they look like at the packet level and how they differ is
    important.

    second appendix provides an overview of how packet information is stored in binary
    and how to convert binary into hexadecimal notation. Then it shows you how to
    dissect packets that are presented in hexadecimal notation with packet diagrams.
    This is handy if you’re going to spend a lot of time analyzing custom protocols
    or using command line analysis tools.

    *Practical Packet Analysis*. Shortly after the release of the first edition of
    this book, I founded a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization—the Rural Technology Fund

- en: Rural students, even those with excellent grades, often have fewer opportunities
    for exposure to technology than their city or suburban counterparts. Established
    in 2008, the RTF is the culmination of one of my biggest dreams. It seeks to reduce
    the digital divide between rural communities and their urban and suburban counterparts.
    The RTF does this through targeted scholarship programs, community involvement,
    donations of educational technology resources to classrooms, and general promotion
    and advocacy of technology in rural and high-poverty areas.

- en: In 2016, the RTF was able to put technology education resources into the hands
    of more than 10,000 students in rural and high-poverty areas in the United States.
    I’m pleased to announce that all of the author’s proceeds from this book go directly
    to the RTF to support these goals. If you want to learn more about the Rural Technology
    Fund or how you can contribute, visit our website at *[http://www.ruraltechfund.org/](http://www.ruraltechfund.org/)*

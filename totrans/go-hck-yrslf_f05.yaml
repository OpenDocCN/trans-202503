    for his thoughtful and thorough technical review across all the changes in Kali

    encouraging me to pursue my dreams—I never knew how far coding and hacking would
    take me. Thanks to my father-in-law, Norman, for always having time to talk computers
    with me. And thanks most of all to my beautiful wife, Bev, and my sons, Alex and
    Max, for their love and support as I wrote this third book—thanks especially for
    making me take breaks to jump on the trampoline, do science experiments, play
    games, watch movies, and swim. This book, and my life, are infinitely better and
    more fun thanks to you.

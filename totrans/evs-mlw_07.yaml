- en: As automated malware sandboxes get better at hiding themselves from evasive
    malware, malware authors must adapt. One tactic they use is to enumerate the user’s
    environment and the user’s interaction with it. As [Chapter 4](chapter4.xhtml)
    noted, the everyday user’s setup has open browser tabs, many windows open and
    apps in use, and frequent mouse and keyboard interaction, making it quite different
    from the sandbox environment. An automated malware analysis sandbox is designed
    to boot up, detonate a malware sample, and then promptly shut down. It may not
    exhibit any normal user behaviors or other indicators that suggest it’s a valid
    end-user system.

- en: Some malware may be able to enumerate the host’s internet cookies, cache, and
    browsing history. *Cookies* are small files that web pages save to the disk, usually
    for storing the user’s website configuration and preferences. Depending on the
    browser and version, cookies can be stored in individual files or in a small database,
    such as SQLite. The *cache* is a file or group of files that stores website resources
    such as images so that the page loads more quickly the next time the user visits
    it. Much like cookies, the cache can be stored in multiple files or in a database.
    Finally, the *browsing history* is simply a list of previously visited websites,
    typically stored as one or more database files.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The typical end user will likely have hundreds or thousands of stored cookie
    and cache files and a large internet browsing history, whereas a typical sandbox
    or malware analysis system may not have any at all. Malware can take advantage
    of this discrepancy by counting the number of cookies, cache entries, or previously
    visited websites and checking it against a threshold value. For example, if the
    victim machine has only five entries in its browsing history, the malware might
    assume it’s running in a clean sandbox environment.

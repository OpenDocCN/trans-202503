    strange money wasn’t any good. Nobody wanted her “Quarter Dollars.” Nobody wanted
    any algorithms, either.

    out of the envelope, Xor made short work of the gibberish in Colonel Trapp’s latest
    message. This one was shorter and more useful than the last.

    walked past earlier: the Fair Coin Savings & Loan. She rushed back there and stepped
    inside to find it looked just like banks back home.'

    on the counter: a few dollar bills, three quarters, a penny, a dime, and her lucky
    poker chip.'

    I’m sorry to say they are worthless here.”

    are remarkable,” he said, examining the poker chip carefully and flipping it a
    few times.

  prefs: []

    one will take them at face value.”

    come from, you can flip quarters fifty-fifty, no problem.”

    “so it might not be exactly even.”

    it. That’s how we test all of our Fair Coins.”

    to get absolutely Fair flips out of even the most unfair coin.”

    heavy coin. “This is a fake Fair Coin. It looks just like a real one, doesn’t
    it? But it’s easy to tell it’s fake because it comes up Heads a lot more than
    Tails.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    comes up Tails-Heads, use Tails as your answer. If you get Heads-Heads or Tails-Tails,
    just start over.”

    Tails will always be *exactly* the same as getting Tails then Heads.”

    three Fair Coins.

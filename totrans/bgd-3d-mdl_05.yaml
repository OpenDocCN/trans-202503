    75 percent of the mechanical models you can find on a design-sharing site like
    Thingiverse, even if how to go about it might not always be obvious. Your ability
    to create complex models depends more on how creatively you can take advantage
    of basic features than on how many advanced features you know how to use.

    body by extruding a closed-loop profile along a path. Unlike the path of a regular
    extrude, the path of a sweep can curve and twist in all three dimensions, which
    makes this feature great for creating wires, tubes, and handles.

    as cross-sections, which the software then merges into a single solid. Unlike
    Sweep, the Loft feature doesn’t need to use a path; it simply morphs one cross-section
    into the next, yielding a single seamless body like the one shown in [Figure 6-2](ch06.xhtml#ch06fig2).

    it’s a line with a slope equal to the slope of a curve function at a single point,
    but you most likely understand it intuitively as a line that continues on from
    a point in a curve. Imagine swinging a marble at the end of string and then releasing
    the string. The line that the marble flies along would be tangent to the curve
    of the marble’s path at the exact moment you released the string.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    On the left, the line is tangent to the circle—just like the path of the marble
    after it has been released. On the right, the line is *not* tangent and represents
    a path the marble therefore *couldn’t* follow. The good news is that Fusion 360
    understands tangents, and all you have to do is add one as a constraint.

    or two planes that meet at 90-degree angles.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These concepts are important because both the Sweep and Loft features take relative
    angles into account. The Sweep feature looks at the angle of the path where it
    meets the profile, whereas the Loft feature looks at the angles between the cross-sections.
    In most cases, you’ll want to ensure that the paths and profiles are either tangent,
    perpendicular, or parallel in order to avoid surprises. In addition to the parts
    of a single sweep or loft, you’ll also want to pay attention to how they intersect
    other features. The model in [Figure 6-4](ch06.xhtml#ch06fig4) shows a gap created
    because the ends of the sweep weren’t made perpendicular to the block faces.

    made perpendicular to the blocks by either decreasing the arc radius or changing
    the block angle. Alternatively, if those items couldn’t be changed because of
    some design constraint, the path could be extended further into the blocks to
    eliminate the gap.

    the path extends into the body of the teapot. If you were to draw it so it stopped

    define the dimensions of a sketch explicitly. In this case, though, the actual
    dimensions aren’t very important, because we’re just going for visual appeal.
    You should still constrain the path to make sure it doesn’t unexpectedly move.
    To do that, simply select the lines and then add a *fix constraint* from the same
    Constraints menu you use to make lines perpendicular or parallel. That should
    lock the lines in place where they are and change them to green to signify that
    they’re fixed.

    avoid the issue we saw in [Figure 6-4](ch06.xhtml#ch06fig4), the profile should
    be perpendicular to the path at the point where they intersect. That’s difficult
    to do, though, considering both arcs end at unusual angles that we didn’t specify
    and wouldn’t be able to measure without additional work. So, we’ll create a construction
    plane that’s perpendicular to the path.

    construction plane. Rather than asking you for a number in millimeters or inches,
    it asks you for a decimal ratio of the total length of the path. So, “0” would
    place the plane at one endpoint, “1” would place it at the other endpoint, and
    “0.5” would place it halfway between the two. In this case, choose either 0 or
    1, and the construction plane will automatically appear perpendicular to the tangent
    at the endpoint of the path.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    All you have left to do is draw a profile for the cross-section of the handle
    on that plane. Unlike the Loft feature, which pieces together multiple profiles,
    the Sweep feature will simply extend one cross-section along the path. In [Figure
    6-9](ch06.xhtml#ch06fig9), you can see the profile I drew (I hid the body to make
    it easier to see). Once again, you can make this whatever shape you like.

    its narrowest point, then a 6 mm wall thickness would cause the two walls to intersect,
    giving you an error. You may need to tweak the thickness and possibly change it
    to Outside instead of Inside (or even use both). In the end, the model should

<p class="noindent">Even though containers are designed to hide some of the complexity of the individual hosts in a cluster and their underlying hardware, real-world applications need tuning to get the most out of the available computing power. This tuning must be done in a way that works with the scalability and resiliency of our Kubernetes cluster so that we donâ€™t lose the advantages of dynamic scheduling and horizontal scaling. In other words, we need to provide hints to a cluster to help it schedule containers in the most efficient way.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_294"/></p>&#13;

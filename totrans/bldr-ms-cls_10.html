In this chapter, we’ll focus on baking textures—creating procedural textures using the geometry, lighting, and materials of objects in our scene. For example, we’ll bake the normals of a high-poly sculpted mesh into a texture map or bake the shadows that a mesh receives in the cracks and grooves of its surface into a texture to mimic dirt and dust. Textures like these can then be used to aid in texturing and creating materials later.</p><p>In this chapter, we’ll discuss the various types of procedural texture maps that Blender is able to bake, their uses, and how to bake them. In <a class="xref" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Texture Painting">Chapter 11</a>, we’ll move on to combining these baked textures with hand painting and other techniques in GIMP and Blender, cleaning them up and combining them with other texture sources, such as photos. Then, in <a class="xref" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Materials">Chapter 12</a>, we’ll cover how to plug all these kinds of maps into Blender’s materials system to create realistic materials for rendering our models with.</p><div class="sect1" title="Images and Textures"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="images_and_textures">Images and Textures</h2></div></div></div><p>First, a little terminology: The terms <span class="emphasis"><em>image</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>texture</em></span> are often used interchangeably. In most circumstances, this is fine, but I shall try to avoid confusion here by explaining my terminology. An <span class="emphasis"><em>image</em></span>, for our purposes, is a picture, perhaps in the form of an image file, like a <span class="emphasis"><em>.jpg</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>.tiff</em></span> file or a file generated within Blender’s UV Image editor with no specific file type assigned to it yet.</p><p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>texture</em></span> in Blender can be any kind of input used to affect the look of a material applied to an object. A texture can be an image, but a texture may also be procedurally generated or taken from a video, point cloud data, or something even more obscure. But because we frequently use images as <a id="iddle1016" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1094" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1159" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1254" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1410" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1634" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1791" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1792" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1805" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1829" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1993" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1994" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2170" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2299" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2487" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2534" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2538" class="indexterm"/>the input for textures, it’s often convenient to refer to “an image used to affect a material’s diffuse color” as a <span class="emphasis"><em>diffuse texture</em></span> for short.</p><p>In general, when I refer to baking textures, I mean an image <span class="emphasis"><em>used</em></span> as a texture. As this would rapidly become tedious to read, I’ll often instead use the term <span class="emphasis"><em>texture</em></span> more loosely—particularly as the process of baking images is so frequently referred to as <span class="emphasis"><em>texture baking</em></span>.</p><p>The term <span class="emphasis"><em>map</em></span> when used in the context of textures (such as <span class="emphasis"><em>texture map</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>diffuse map</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>displacement map</em></span>) refers to an image used for a UV unwrapped object—one in which each point on the object can be mapped to a point on the image.</p><p>In this book, I often talk about <span class="emphasis"><em>assigning</em></span> an image or texture to an object. Assigning an image to an object is different from assigning a texture.</p><div class="sect2" title="Assigning an Image"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="assigning_an_image">Assigning an Image</h3></div></div></div><p>When I assign an image to an object, I link that image with the object’s active UV coordinate set. This causes the image to be displayed on the object when using the <span class="emphasis"><em>Textured Solid</em></span> shading option in the 3D Viewport (found under Display in the 3D Viewport Properties region). It also means that when baking images, this will be the image that is baked to.</p><p>To assign an image to an object’s UV coordinates, select the object in the 3D Viewport and press <span class="smaller">TAB</span> to enter Edit mode. Hit <span class="strong"><strong>A</strong></span> to select all, then in the UV Image editor (I’m assuming here that the object has already been unwrapped), use the dropdown menu in the Editors header to select an image to assign to the active UV set.</p><p>To create a new image and assign that instead, use <span class="strong"><strong>Image</strong></span>▸<span class="strong"><strong>New Image</strong></span> to create a new image to bake to with the size and properties you specify.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Assigning Textures"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="assigning_textures">Assigning Textures</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Textures</em></span> are assigned to materials, which are then assigned to objects or parts of objects. Textures are used to affect how an object will be rendered and also as inputs for some modifiers. To assign a material to an object, go to the Materials tab of the Properties editor to choose a material from the drop-down menu at the top of the tab or create a new material with the <span class="strong"><strong>+New</strong></span> button. You can then assign textures to this material in the Textures tab in the same way.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Texture-Baking Controls"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="texture-baking_controls">Texture-Baking Controls</h2></div></div></div><p>To bake a texture (technically, an image—from here on I will use the two terms less rigorously) in Blender, use the Bake panel in the Render tab of the Properties editor (shown in <a class="xref" href="ch10.html#texture-baking_controls_while_working_in" title="Figure 10-1. Texture-baking controls while working in the UV editing layout we created in Chapter 8.

Here’s what Blender has to offer:</p><p title="Full Render"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Full Render</strong></span></strong></span>. This does a full render, including textures and lighting of your surface. The resulting texture is exactly how your model will look in your final render, mapped to the object’s UV coordinates.</p><p title="Ambient Occlusion"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Ambient Occlusion</strong></span></strong></span>. This renders ambient occlusion for the object, taking into account any other visible, renderable objects on the currently active layers. Ambient occlusion is a selfshadowing effect that creates dark areas in the corners and crevices of objects. It’s useful both for mimicking the effect of more complex lighting, as well as for creating a rough map of areas where dirt and dust are likely to accumulate. This kind of map is often very useful when creating textures and materials (see <a class="xref" href="ch10.html#ambient_occlusion_mapcomma_baked_and_app" title="Figure 10-2. An ambient occlusion map, baked and applied to the mesh as a texture (the eyes here have been left black)">Figure 10-2</a>).</p><p title="Shadow"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Shadow</strong></span></strong></span>. This renders the shadows from lights in the scene into a map.</p><p title="Normals"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Normals</strong></span></strong></span>. This takes the normal vector of the object’s surface at each point and records it as an RGB value. This is done in a variety of ways, depending on the normal space option you choose. Different normal spaces record the normals of the mesh relative to different coordinate systems. For example, the <span class="emphasis"><em>Camera</em></span> option records them relative to the camera; <span class="emphasis"><em>World</em></span>, according to world space; <span class="emphasis"><em>Object</em></span>, according to the object’s local coordinates; and <span class="emphasis"><em>Tangent</em></span>, according to the surface normal of the baked object itself.</p><div class="figure"><a id="ambient_occlusion_mapcomma_baked_and_app"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00194"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538630.png.jpg" alt="An ambient occlusion map, baked and applied to the mesh as a texture (the eyes here have been left black)"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 10-2. An ambient occlusion map, baked and applied to the mesh as a texture (the eyes here have been left black)</div></div><p><a id="iddle1225" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1401" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2549" class="indexterm"/>Of these, Tangent is probably the most important; it lets you bake the normals of one mesh to the surface of another by enabling the Selected to Active setting, selecting your source mesh (or meshes) and the target, and then baking. This renders the normals of the source mesh relative to the selected target mesh. This map can then be used to distort the surface normals of the mesh when it is rendered, giving the impression (when the map is applied as part of the object’s material) of having a lot of detail in the surface when in fact the underlying geometry can be much simpler. (See <a class="xref" href="ch10.html#normal_mapping_vsdot_displacement_mappin" title="Figure 10-3. Normal mapping vs. displacement mapping">Figure 10-3</a> for an example of this effect.) Tangent space normal maps are particularly useful because the normals are recorded relative to the surface of the mesh itself, so they work even when the mesh is distorted from its original shape by modifiers or further editing, so long as the UV coordinates remain the same.</p><p title="Textures"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Textures</strong></span></strong></span>. This bakes the diffuse color of any materials and colors applied to the mesh. This can be useful for baking procedural colors and textures into a UV map.</p><p title="Displacement"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Displacement</strong></span></strong></span>. This converts the distance between two meshes into a black-and-white image. Black represents negative displacement, mid-gray represents zero displacement, and white represents positive displacement. Use the Selected to Active option to bake from a source mesh (or meshes) to the active mesh.</p><p>The Displacement map is generally used as an alternative to normal maps, and this map can then be used as the input for the Displace modifier or the Displace setting of a material to deform a mesh into the shape of the source mesh (see <a class="xref" href="ch10.html#normal_mapping_vsdot_displacement_mappin" title="Figure 10-3. Normal mapping vs. displacement mapping">Figure 10-3</a>). Alternatively, a baked displacement map can be used as a <span class="emphasis"><em>bump map</em></span> for a material. (Bump maps work like normal maps, giving the impression of surface detail by altering the shading of the surface, but they require only black and white input.)</p><p>Normal maps are a very efficient way to give the impression of detail, but they don’t affect the silhouette of the mesh or the casting of shadows because no <span class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span> geometry is displaced. Displacement mapping creates real detail by deforming the mesh but requires you to subdivide the mesh to provide sufficient geometry to deform. In <a class="xref" href="ch10.html#normal_mapping_vsdot_displacement_mappin" title="Figure 10-3. Normal mapping vs. displacement mapping">Figure 10-3</a>, a group of spheres has been baked to a normal map (8 bit) and a displacement map (32 bit). These maps have then been <a id="iddle1034" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1134" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1137" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1396" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1399" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1457" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1854" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1855" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1893" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1903" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1913" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1928" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2374" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2375" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2445" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2480" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2483" class="indexterm"/>applied to a plane and a cylinder. The normalmapped objects capture a lot of the shading with much lower polycounts, but they don’t affect the actual shape of the mesh or cast shadows. The displacement-mapped objects are much more realistic, but they have to be subdivided in order to capture all the details.</p><div class="figure"><a id="normal_mapping_vsdot_displacement_mappin"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00195"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538632.png.jpg" alt="Normal mapping vs. displacement mapping"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 10-3. Normal mapping vs. displacement mapping</div></div><p title="Alpha"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Alpha</strong></span></strong></span>. This bakes the alpha transparency of the mesh to a texture. It’s useful for baking procedural values to an image texture.</p><p title="Emission"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Emission</strong></span></strong></span>. This bakes the emission color and amount of a material into a texture. As with the texture map, this can be useful in baking procedural emission colors into an image texture.</p><p title="Mirror Colors"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Mirror Colors</strong></span></strong></span>. This bakes the color of ray-traced reflections for a material into a texture. It’s useful for baking procedural values to an image texture.</p><p title="Mirror Intensity"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Mirror Intensity</strong></span></strong></span>. This bakes the amount of ray-traced reflection for a material into a texture and is useful for baking procedural values to an image texture.</p><p title="Specular Colors"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Specular Colors</strong></span></strong></span>. This bakes the color of specular reflections of a material into a texture and is useful for baking procedural values to an image texture.</p><p title="Specular Intensity"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Specular Intensity</strong></span></strong></span>. This bakes the amount of specular reflection of a material into a texture. It’s useful for baking procedural values to an image texture.</p><p>Each kind of texture map has a purpose from time to time, but in this chapter, we’ll focus on ambient occlusion, texture, normal, and displacement maps most often. Of the texture maps, these maps are the most useful for use with painted textures and for rendering detailed final models.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Baking Textures for the Bat Creature"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="baking_textures_for_the_bat_creature">Baking Textures for the Bat Creature</h2></div></div></div><p>In the case of the Bat Creature, my aim was to create textures for the skin and to bake a displacement map for rendering the final model with a Displace modifier in order to capture all the details I sculpted earlier. In this section I’ll discuss how I baked maps for ambient occlusion and displacement to help with this. I’ll also cover baking a normal map as an alternative to displacement maps, one that renders a lot more quickly though at the cost of some accuracy in representing the fine details.</p><div class="sect2" title="Baking Displacement from Sculpt to Final Mesh"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="baking_displacement_from_sculpt_to_final">Baking Displacement from Sculpt to Final Mesh</h3></div></div></div><p>Because I continued sculpting on the retopologized mesh, I could just render the final mesh directly. But this isn’t always desirable, because the Multires modifier can sometimes get corrupted and displaying its effects in the 3D Viewport can be slow and unwieldy. A better solution would be to bake a displacement map using either the high-poly sculpt, which can then be applied as part of a material, or the Subdivision Surface and Displace modifiers to reconstitute the high-poly details of the mesh only when it is rendered, leaving it simple and quick to work on in the 3D Viewport.</p><p>To bake the displacement for the Bat Creature, I first selected the body of the creature (the high-poly sculpt), duplicated it, and then applied the Multires modifier at level 3. This is the mesh I’ll use as the final body mesh for rendering. (I’ll add the hair that I created in <a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Hair and Particle Systems">Chapter 9</a> to the final scene as a separate object.) This captures most of the detail already, but I’ll use a displacement map to capture the highest resolution detail.</p><p><a id="iddle1095" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1136" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1163" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1472" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1635" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2010" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2482" class="indexterm"/>Next I needed to add a Subdivision Surface modifier to match the level of subdivision between the top level of the multires mesh and the new, soon-to-be displaced mesh. I added the modifier and set the number of subdivisions to 2.</p><p>Then, in Edit mode, I selected the whole mesh, and in the UV Image editor, I added a new image for the displacement map to be baked to. This image needed to be a 32-bit float image in order to capture all of the details of the displacement without creating artifacts. I set its size to 4096×4096 pixels, more than enough to capture all the details of the sculpt. I selected the original multires mesh and my new final mesh. As shown in <a class="xref" href="ch10.html#settings_for_baking_the_displacement_map" title="Figure 10-4. Settings for baking the displacement map for the Bat Creature">Figure 10-4</a>, I made sure that Selected to Active was enabled and Normalize was unchecked, and I set the Margin setting to 4 to give a 4-pixel border around the UV islands, reducing the chance of artifacts around UV seams. (The other settings were left at their defaults.)</p><p>At this point I was ready to bake my texture, so I clicked Bake in the Bake panel and set Blender to work baking my texture. This baked the displacement between my high-poly sculpt and my subdivided final mesh into a displacement map holding all of the detail of the high-poly sculpt. Once finished, I saved this as a 32-bit OpenEXR image to preserve all the information present in the displacement map by pressing F3 while in the UV Image editor and setting the format (in the bottom left of the file browser editor) to EXR (see <a class="xref" href="ch10.html#saving_the_displacement_map_as_a_32-bit" title="Figure 10-5. Saving the displacement map as a 32-bit OpenEXR image">Figure 10-5</a>). You can choose Float (Full) to use 32-bit values. Setting the Codec to ZIP will keep the file size a bit smaller.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Bit Depth and Textures"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="bit_depth_and_textures">Bit Depth and Textures</h3></div></div></div><p>I’ve touched on bit depth briefly, but now I’ll explain it a bit further. <span class="emphasis"><em>Bit depth</em></span> refers to the number of bits (that is, the length of a number in binary) that is used to store the red, green, blue, and alpha (RGBA) values for each pixel in an image. The more bits used to store each number, the more distinct levels there are, and the greater the range and subtlety of colors and brightnesses that can be stored in an image.</p><p>Most image formats (such as <span class="emphasis"><em>.jpg</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>.png</em></span>) use 8-bit color, which is fine for simply displaying pictures on screen or even for storing simple diffuse textures. But if you plan on performing more complex manipulations on your images, such as using them for displacement maps or altering their colors and exposure, you’ll start to see artifacts appear.</p><p>For such demanding use cases, you can use higher bit depths (either 16 or 32 bit) for images, which give you a greater range of values to work with. Using higher bit depths will prevent ugly artifacts from appearing in your renders and displaced meshes. The OpenEXR (<span class="emphasis"><em>.exr</em></span>) format is a good choice for saving high-bit-depth images. For low-bit-depth images, I generally use the Targa (<span class="emphasis"><em>.tga</em></span>) format.</p><div class="figure"><a id="settings_for_baking_the_displacement_map"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00196"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538634.png.jpg" alt="Settings for baking the displacement map for the Bat Creature"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 10-4. Settings for baking the displacement map for the Bat Creature</div></div><div class="figure"><a id="saving_the_displacement_map_as_a_32-bit"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00197"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538636.png.jpg" alt="Saving the displacement map as a 32-bit OpenEXR image"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 10-5. Saving the displacement map as a 32-bit OpenEXR image</div></div><p><a id="iddle1473" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2011" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2234" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2425" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2466" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2551" class="indexterm"/>During the baking of texture maps, most types of textures can be saved in 8-bit formats.

Having added a Subdivision Surface modifier to the duplicated body object, we have the geometry we need, so we can simply add a Displacement modifier to the object as well.</p><p>To assign the displacement map, we use the <span class="emphasis"><em>image</em></span> we baked as input for a <span class="emphasis"><em>texture</em></span>; this texture can then be assigned as the input for the displacement modifier. (Here, I’m using the more rigorous definitions that I discussed at the beginning of this chapter.)</p><p>The easiest way to create and modify a texture block is to add a material to the model, if you haven’t already (we created a MatCap material in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Sculpting">Chapter 6</a> that we no longer require; we can either use this or create a new one), and then add a new texture to this material using the Textures tab of the Properties editor by clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>+New</strong></span> button with an empty texture slot selected. Give the texture a useful name like <span class="emphasis"><em>Body_Displacement</em></span>, then set the type of this texture to <span class="strong"><strong>Image</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Movie</strong></span>. In the Image panel that appears, open your displacement map.</p><p>Now return to the Modifiers tab and, in the Displacement modifier, use the texture dropdown menu to select the texture you just created. Leave Direction set to <span class="strong"><strong>Normal</strong></span> and set Texture Coordinates to <span class="strong"><strong>UV</strong></span>. A strength of <span class="strong"><strong>1.0</strong></span> should give the correct amount of displacement. Adjusting the View Subdivision Levels setting on the Subdivision Surface modifier will let you see more or less of the detail generated by the displacement map.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Baking Normal Maps"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="baking_normal_maps">Baking Normal Maps</h3></div></div></div><p>While we won’t use one for our final renders, normal maps are a useful and quick-to-render alternative to displacement maps. They are frequently used in game engines because they are fast enough to use in real-time applications. They can also be used with the Blender Internal renderer to give the impression of extra detail without requiring such dense geometry.</p><p>The process of baking a normal map is very similar to baking a displacement map. First, you assign a new blank image to your duplicated mesh (it doesn’t need to be 32 bit). Then, select the sculpt first and then the duplicate. We don’t need to apply a Subdivision Surface modifier to the duplicate this time because the silhouette of our character is broadly fine and normal mapping doesn’t require extra geometry (it doesn’t physically displace the mesh). Next, from the Render tab of the Properties editor, set the Bake mode to <span class="strong"><strong>Normals</strong></span> and Normal Space to <span class="strong"><strong>Tangent</strong></span>, enable <span class="strong"><strong>Selected to Active</strong></span>, and click <span class="strong"><strong>Bake</strong></span> (see <a class="xref" href="ch10.html#baking_a_normal_mapdot_normal_space_is_s" title="Figure 10-7. Baking a normal map.

Some artifacts are present in the bake, but these can be corrected later in GIMP (see Chapter 11).">Figure 10-7</a>).</p><p>The resulting map will be a bluish texture, with other colors denoting areas of the sculpt that face in different directions relative to the normals of the unsubdivided duplicate mesh. This texture may later be applied as part of the object’s material to give the effect of mimicking the surface forms of the sculpted mesh (see <a class="xref" href="ch10.html#normal_map_applied_as_part_of_the_materi" title="Figure 10-8. The normal map applied as part of the material, previewed in the 3D Viewport using GLSL shading.

The model would still benefit from an ambient occlusion map, though, which will be useful during the texturing process. To save time when painting colors for the textures, it will also help to assign some basic materials with different colors to the parts of the model and then bake these colors into an image to serve as a guide when painting textures.</p><div class="sect2" title="Baking Maps for Multiple Objects"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="baking_maps_for_multiple_objects">Baking Maps for Multiple Objects</h3></div></div></div><p>In <a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. UV Unwrapping">Chapter 8</a>, I packed the UV coordinates for most of the Spider Bot model onto a single UV grid so that I’d require fewer texture images later on. Next I needed to bake the maps for all of the objects together. To do this, first make sure they all have the same image assigned to their UV coordinates. If so, you could simply select all of the objects for the Spider Bot that share the same UV coordinates and click Bake to bake all of the selected objects at once.</p><p>But what if you want to be selective about which parts of the model are visible when baking different objects? Or if you wish to be able to correct parts without rebaking the entire model? By default, Blender will clear the texture every time you click Bake, preventing you from baking multiple times with different objects selected. To prevent this, turn off the Clear setting in the Bake panel, and Blender will replace only the parts of the image assigned to the selected objects. This will allow you to bake objects one at a time, in groups, or all at once, adding to the texture map as we go along.</p><p><a id="iddle1043" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1729" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2298" class="indexterm"/>This selective technique comes in handy for pieces like the legs. Because some of the leg components overlap slightly, if they were baked together, the overlapping areas would come out black when we bake our ambient occlusion map. And if we were to later re-pose the legs, these black regions might show through.</p><p>To avoid baking in shadows from overlapping objects that may not always be there, use Blender’s layers. Blender bakes objects only on the currently visible layers, so we can isolate the parts we want to include each time on a single layer and then bake them. To do so, take the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Select the objects you wish to bake and press <span class="strong"><strong>M</strong></span> to bring up a menu that allows you to pick which layers the object should be visible on.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Select a new empty layer (check the layers icons in the 3D Viewport header to see which ones are occupied) and press <span class="smaller">ENTER</span> to put the object on that layer.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Jump to the selected layer in the 3D Viewport, either with the selector in the header or using the keyboard shortcuts (1 through 0 on the keyboard for layers 1 to 10, <span class="smaller">ALT</span>-1 through <span class="smaller">ALT</span>-0 for layers 11 through 20).</p><div class="figure"><a id="baking_the_ambient_occlusion_map_for_the"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00203"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538648.png.jpg" alt="Baking the ambient occlusion map for the head and body segments of the Spider Bot.

For example, for the head section of the Spider Bot, I baked the antenna and extra parts of the head along with the head mesh and kept the wires at the back of the head/body segment on the same layer while baking (though I baked these separately). I baked the legs as individual pieces, isolating each type of leg part on its own layer before baking.

When deciding what size textures to bake, consider how much detail your model has and how much will be present in the bake beforehand in order to optimize the resolution of the texture you use.</p><p>In general, a good rule of thumb to follow for displacement maps is that the size of the map in pixels need not be much bigger than the polycount of the mesh. So if you are baking about a 1M poly sculpt, a 1024×1024 pixel map will probably suffice. For other texture maps, consider the size that an object will appear in the final render. If an object will appear only a few hundred pixels high in the final render, its texture map should be about the same size. On the other hand, if an object appears close-up at a high resolution, then bigger textures will be needed.</p><p>In the case of particularly simple textures, like the flat colors we baked for the Spider Bot, you can make the image much smaller while baking and scale it up in an image editing program like GIMP later (making sure to increase the margin setting to prevent seams).</p><p>When creating images to bake to, set bit depths appropriately. Displacement maps require 32-bit images, while other texture types typically only require 8-bit (or 16-bit if you plan to manipulate them heavily). Blender can bake either 8- or 32-bit images, but remember the bit depth you end up with is also determined by the file format you save to. Use OpenEXR for high-bit-depth images and <span class="emphasis"><em>.tga</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>.png</em></span> files for 8-bit images. Additionally, remember that GIMP can only edit 8-bit images (for now, that is—future versions are likely to incorporate support for high-bit-depth images), so if you plan on painting textures in GIMP, the extra depth is of little help.</p><p>When baking ambient occlusion or lighting, consider isolating the pieces you are baking on one layer to get more control over the results. And finally, it can be helpful to change the world settings (or settings for lamps if you’re baking lighting) to achieve higher-quality baked textures. (See <a class="xref" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. Lighting">Chapter 13</a> for more on world and lighting settings.)</p></div><div class="sect1" title="In Review"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="in_review-id00018">In Review</h2></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we’ve discussed baking textures into images using Blender’s baking tools and the kinds of maps Blender will allow you to bake. I used these techniques to bake maps for my various projects: For the Bat Creature, I baked displacement and ambient occlusion maps, and for the Spider Bot, I baked ambient occlusion and some block colors to aid with texturing later. While I didn’t need to do a lot of texture baking for the Jungle Temple scene, I did create an ambient occlusion map for the statue.</p><p>In the next chapter, we’ll combine the textures we’ve baked with other ways of creating textures, from painting and cloning textures directly in Blender to painting in GIMP and combining photo textures to synthesize new ones.</p></div></section></body></html>

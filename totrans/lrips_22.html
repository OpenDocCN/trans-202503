Fair Coin out of an Unfair Coin? Can you really use ants to find shorter paths? Yes, you can do
both—and a lot more besides. In this guide, you’ll find out how some of the places,

just like an ordinary word! Computer scientists (and really, all scientists) love inventing new
words. We call these specialized words <span class="emphasis"><em>jargon</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>argot</em></span>.
Jargon can be good, because it saves time when you’re discussing things with your colleagues.
It can also be bad, because it excludes nonexperts from the conversation.</p><p>When you’re just starting out with programming, all the jargon, argot, and weird new
words can be intimidating, but don’t let that stop you from learning. Jargon can be silly, or
powerful, or dangerous, depending on how you use it. But no matter what words you use, if you always
obfuscate instead of explicate, no one will understand you!</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Wandering salesman"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="wandering_salesman"/>Wandering salesman</h2></div></div></div><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>Traveling Salesman problem</em></span> is a classic computer science question.
Given a group of cities, your goal is to find the shortest <span class="emphasis"><em>Hamiltonian path</em></span>, a
route that lets you visit each city only once. If you have a large number of cities, it would take a
very long time to calculate that path, even for a computer. So the Wandering Salesman might be on
the road for quite a while!</p><p>Instead of calculating the exact answer, the salesman looks for a path through all the towns
that’s <span class="emphasis"><em>close enough</em></span> to being the shortest. A very interesting aspect of
the Traveling Salesman problem is that humans are pretty good at solving small examples by hand.
There is much discussion about what algorithm people use in their heads while solving it. See also

lower than these two bounds.</p><p>In the real world, finding an upper and lower limit on a problem can simplify things a lot.
Say you have to guess a person’s age. It’s unlikely that anyone is over 150 years old,
and no one can be younger than 0 years old. So, 150 is the <span class="emphasis"><em>upper limit</em></span> and 0 is
the <span class="emphasis"><em>lower limit</em></span>. You can narrow down the bounds even more with simple
questions. Is the person still in school? If so, then he is probably younger than 30. Can the person
drive a car? If so, then he is probably older than 15.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Mile Zero"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="mile_zero"/>Mile Zero</h2></div></div></div><p>You sometimes see signs that mark a point on a highway, like “Mile 14.” Now, if
there is a Mile 14, then there must be a Mile 13, and a Mile 12, and so on. Everything has to start
somewhere, and Zero is where it starts. Possibly the most famous Mile Zero is in Key West, Florida.
It’s at the beginning of US Route 1, which goes all the way to Canada. If you look carefully

<span class="emphasis"><em>Composing</em></span> is the act of combining small ideas into bigger ones to solve a

numbers isn’t anything special. You can think of it as adding a number to itself and

in your problem space. Try to imagine every single thing you could possibly do to try to move that
box. You could walk forward, walk backward, stick out your tongue, sing a song, write an equation,
use a lever, call for help, look for a forklift, or do literally anything else you can think of.
Write down as many of these possibilities as you can fit on a piece of paper.</p><p>Out of that huge space of possibilities, imagine only the ones that have a good chance of
moving the box. Circle those with a red pen. The circled ones are in the solution space. They
<span class="emphasis"><em>make sense</em></span> because they would accomplish your goal, and the rest don’t
make sense. Now, look again at all of the circled possibilities and think about which one is best
(fastest, cheapest, easiest, most reliable, and so on). Underline that one in green. That’s
the most <span class="emphasis"><em>sensible</em></span> answer out of all the ones that make sense.</p><p>The point of this exercise is to avoid a very human, very common error: we tend to grasp at
the first solution we think of and forget to consider other possibilities. This is what Eponymous

great way to get things done faster, and computers can share work, too!</p><p>You can find the Round Robin method almost anywhere. Imagine a bus route that takes an hour to
complete. If you put two buses on that route, a bus will arrive at each stop every 30 minutes. With
three buses, you’d see a bus every 20 minutes, and four means you’d see one every 15
minutes. With five buses, you’d see one every 12 minutes, and so on. Just divide 60 (the
number of minutes in an hour) by the number of buses to see how often a bus should come.</p><p>But you have to be careful to make sure the buses arrive at each stop at evenly spaced times.
Five buses reaching one stop all at once wouldn’t be balanced. Also, if one bus breaks down

the answer is the one you want, you stop. If it’s not, you take the answer you found, plug it
into the same process, and run it again.</p><p>Let’s look at an example of recursion in action right here in Userland. Recall from
<a class="xref" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 10. A Well-Timed Entrance">Chapter 10</a> that Jane Hecate has a single, gigantic book of names. The
name <span class="emphasis"><em>Lauren</em></span> starts with <span class="emphasis"><em>L</em></span>, so Jane should find it in the
<span class="emphasis"><em>L</em></span> section of her book, but that could take a while with so many pages. If Jane
wants a faster way to look for <span class="emphasis"><em>Lauren</em></span>, she can divide the book into two equal
halves and see if <span class="emphasis"><em>L</em></span> is in the first half or the second half.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>First half: {A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M}</p><p>Second half: {N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z}</p></blockquote></div><p>Since <span class="emphasis"><em>L</em></span> is in the first half, Jane can then divide the first half of the

there’s no limit to how much of that thing exists. When Tortoise demonstrates how an infinite
string can be less than two inches long, he shows that you can split that string into an infinite
number of smaller pieces.</p><p>Infinity is <span class="emphasis"><em>big</em></span>, bigger than you can imagine. But you can hold infinity
in your mind simply by saying a few words. There are infinite odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on, up
to forever. There are infinite even numbers, too: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on. No matter how hard you
look, you will never find an odd number in the list of even numbers or an even number among the odd
ones. That means there are at least two kinds of infinity: the even numbers and the odd
numbers.</p><p>There are also <span class="emphasis"><em>infinite kinds of infinity</em></span>. Think about all the numbers
divisible by 3 and all the numbers <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> divisible by 3 (or 4, or 5). Now imagine
all the numbers that no one else has thought of before. That’s another kind of
infinity!</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00062a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00062"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="figs/web/163fig01.png.jpg"/></div></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Infinite Regress"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="infinite_regress"/>Infinite Regress</h2></div></div></div><p>If you think about how you think, you might then start thinking about how you think about how

time you fall into this mental trap, it can be confusing or even scary. The trick is not to take it
too seriously.</p><p>If you think this sounds related to recursion, you’re correct! It would be quite
troubling to get stuck in a recursive process forever. In real computers, infinite recursion never
actually happens because no computer can hold an infinite amount of information. When the computer
runs out of room while working on something recursive, you never know what might happen. Laurie and

true.</p><p>Say you have two ideas: (A) “You have the password” and (B) “You may

(Placing two ideas on
either side of that little arrow is another way to say, “IF A is true, THEN B is
true.”)</p><p>But how do you know the rule is true? Maybe that’s not how you enter Symbol. So you have
to show that both the rule (A → B), and the first idea, A, are true. In this case, we need to
be sure that both the rule (“IF you have the password, THEN you may enter”) and the idea
(“You have the password”) are true before we let anyone through the gate.</p><p>That’s what the semantic turnstile is for. We put the rule and the first idea on the
left of the turnstile, and put the second idea (B, which is “You may enter” in this
case) on the right:</p><p>(A → B), (A) ╞ (B)</p><p>This means “IF our rule is true and IF you actually have the password, THEN you may
enter.”</p><p>Here’s the weirder part: you might have noticed that the turnstile looks a lot like an
IF...THEN. IF everything to the left is true, THEN the idea on the right is true. So how do we know
this rule as a whole is true? Do we need a turnstile for the turnstile?</p><p>(A → B), (A) ╞ (B) ╞ (C)</p><p>. . . and then a turnstile for that one, and for the next one?</p><p>(A → B), (A) ╞ (B) ╞ (C) ╞ (D) ╞ (E) ╞ (F) ╞ (G) . .
.</p><p>In theory, you have to pass an infinite number of turnstiles before you know anything is true!
It’s a wonder we are able to put our shoes on in the morning! So how do we know that anything
is true? How do you know your milk will come out of the carton at breakfast tomorrow, or that your
classroom won’t be on the roof when you get to school?</p><p>In practice, we simply trust that the rules we live by are true, since we’ve seen them
work in the past. However, it can be fun and useful to poke into the rules, as Laurie did. Even if
they turn out to make sense, you learn a lot about how they work. Poking at rules is a big part of
what science is all about! See <span class="emphasis"><em>Infinite Regress</em></span> (<a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 4. What the Tortoise Said to Laurie">Chapter 4</a>; <a class="xref" href="pr03.html#infinity" title="Infinity">Infinity</a>) and <span class="emphasis"><em>It’s

ants find many different paths on the map at random, and by following the scent trails of other
ants. Scent trails eventually dry up if no new ants follow them. The shorter a path is, the more
ants follow it, which makes the scent stronger. Over time, shorter paths become more popular and
longer ones fade away. Based on what Laurie saw the ants do, she knows the path is short, even if it
may not be the shortest, so she can use that as a heuristic to get home more quickly.</p><p>Something to think about: Is Hugh Rustic’s ant map through Userland the shortest

<span class="emphasis"><em>counting argument</em></span>. The idea behind a counting argument is that you can solve
some problems by ignoring unimportant differences between things and counting only how many there
are. For example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Everyone wants to use General Euripides’s books all at once. But reader or writer, only
<span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> person can use any given book at a time.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>General Darius was so concerned with getting the mandel-broccoli, the wolf, and the goat
across the stream that he didn’t think of counting backward—of bringing the goat across
<span class="emphasis"><em>multiple times</em></span>. But mandelbroccoli or wolf, as long as you don’t leave
the goat alone with it, everything works out.</p></li></ul></div><p>Sometimes it’s the opposite: you have to count the same thing different ways to see if
they add up. General Case stopped counting posts after he hit 100 feet of fence; he wasn’t
thinking about holding up the last length! Count the gaps <span class="emphasis"><em>between</em></span> the posts and
you get 10. Count the <span class="emphasis"><em>posts</em></span>, and you get 11.</p><p>When Tinker tells Laurie to count paths that are mirror images of other paths (like BCD and

its name, just as Laurie did when she said you could also call a turtle a “Green Round animal

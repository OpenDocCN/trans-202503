<div class="image1"><img src="Images/common.jpg" alt="Images" width="246" height="245"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The key to understanding how parametric modeling software works is in its name: with parametric modeling, you define every single feature by a collection of characteristics called parameters. For example, a simple cube is constructed by defining variables like its origin, height, width, and depth. Those dimensions are simply the parameters that the software uses to describe the cube. You can then use the software to save all of those parameters and then edit or reference them later.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Using parameter-based modeling is very important in engineering for a few reasons. The most obvious reason is that when you’re designing a physical part for the real world, you need to define its dimensions exactly. For example, you can’t rely on visual estimates to design a piston that fits into an engine. Instead, you need to explicitly define the piston’s exact size and shape through specified dimensions—the parameters that make up your model.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec11"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_8"/>Using Features as Building Blocks</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The building blocks of parametric modeling are called <em>features</em>. Individual features are often just primitive polygons—basic shapes that you put together with other features to end up with a complex part. One of the fundamental skills you’ll learn as a designer is how to break the complex part you envision into a series of basic features.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">That process of breaking a component, such as the one shown in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig1">Figure 2-1</a>, into individual features is a task that each person will approach differently. There isn’t necessarily a right or wrong approach. Two designers might end up with the exact same part using a completely different series of features. Of course, best practices for efficient modeling do exist.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="ch02fig1"/><img src="Images/02fig01.jpg" alt="Images" width="922" height="685"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 2-1: A simple part composed of multiple features. The numbers indicate the order the features were added to the part.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you’re a beginner at parametric modeling, you might be tempted to try to use as few features as possible, but that approach generally isn’t ideal. Individual features will end up being overly complex, and might contain mistakes that can be hard to find and difficult to modify later. However, the opposite is also true—creating a series of very simple features can be time consuming and inefficient. A balance between complexity and efficiency is best.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Understanding how to find a happy medium is the hallmark of a good designer. With practice and experience, you’ll learn how to break down an intricate part into a series of features that follow a logical plan. Which path you choose to follow is up to you as a designer, but the key is to take your time and make a plan.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_9"/>When you were building a LEGO spaceship when you were little, you probably had an idea of what you wanted the spaceship to look like. But how you actually built that spaceship was completely up to you. Now, let’s say your friend came along and decided he wanted to build his own spaceship that looked just like yours. Just because he was able to do so doesn’t mean he got there the same way. He could have used a completely different set of bricks and still ended up with a spaceship that had the same final size and shape.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can think of features in parametric modeling software like those individual LEGO bricks. The bricks come in all different sizes, shapes, and styles, and you can use them for many purposes. In parametric modeling software, one feature can be used to create a basic cube, while another might be used to cut a hole through that cube. Still another could be used to round the edges and corners.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Every feature you’ll work with is defined by at least one parameter, such as the depth of a cut. Most features will have numerous parameters that either you set explicitly or the software generates for later use. On many features, like the Extrude shown in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig2">Figure 2-2</a>, you’ll use parameters in conjunction with <em>sketches</em>, which are 2D drawings that are used to make 3D shapes or to define locations or paths.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="ch02fig2"/><img src="Images/02fig02.jpg" alt="Images" width="926" height="549"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 2-2: An Extrude, which is defined in conjunction with a sketch</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can use a sketch to draw the profile shape of a cavity you’re cutting into a part, or to make a path that a piece of tubing will follow. Not all features require a sketch, but most do, and you’ll find yourself spending the majority of your modeling time creating sketches.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec12"><strong>The Fusion 360 Workspace</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Now that you’re familiar with the principles of parametric modeling, it’s time to get acquainted with the Autodesk Fusion 360 workspace. One of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_10"/>major factors that holds hobbyists back from jumping into computer-aided design (CAD) is the complexity of the software. The interface is chock full of buttons and toolbars that seem meaningless at first glance, so the uninitiated might feel overwhelmed. CAD becomes significantly less daunting once you grasp the fundamentals of the workspace.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec13"><strong><em>Downloading Fusion 360</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Autodesk Fusion 360 is available for Windows and macOS. You can find a download link at <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/free-trial/"><em>https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/free-trial/</em></a>. Fusion 360 is free for hobbyists and enthusiasts; you only need to pay for it if you’re using it for commercial purposes making more than $100,000 per year. You can enter your own name as the company name when asked for it.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Because Fusion 360 is cloud-based software, you need to have a free Autodesk account to access it. Follow the links to download the installer to your computer. Once the software installation is complete, follow the prompts to create an Autodesk account, or sign in if you already have one. If you’re using Fusion 360 for noncommercial purposes, be sure to choose the option for hobbyists.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">After creating an account and signing in, you’ll be asked to choose the units you want to work with. For the sake of easy math, I’ll be using millimeters throughout the book, but you can use inches if you prefer. You can always change this setting later or set it for individual files. After you choose the units, you should see a screen that looks something like the one in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="ch02fig3"/><img src="Images/02fig03.jpg" alt="Images" width="925" height="742"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 2-3: The Fusion 360 startup screen</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_11"/>The screen is divided into two panes: the left pane is your project browser, where you can find files (though they’re stored in the cloud), and the right pane is your workspace.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec14"><strong><em>Using the Project Browser</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">By default, you get a <em>project</em> called “[your name]’s First Project” where your files will reside. You can use this project or, if you like, create a new one. This project is where your 3D models, drawings, and other files are saved as Fusion 360 documents.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Later, when you’re working with larger projects, you can create folders to keep your projects organized. If you collaborate with another user, you could share a project with them to give them access to your files. To open or close the Project Browser (to save monitor real estate), use the icons in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="ch02fig4"/><img src="Images/02fig04.jpg" alt="Images" width="907" height="443"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 2-4: Closing and opening the Project Browser</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You should only need to have the Project Browser open when you’re creating a new project, changing projects, or opening an existing file. Otherwise, you can keep it closed to give yourself as much screen space as possible for the workspace pane, which is where you’ll actually be working. The file icon between the Project Browser and Save buttons lets you access menu options for creating a new file, saving a file, exporting a model, and so on.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec15"><strong><em>Switching Workspaces</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In the primary workspace pane, you should see the main toolbar across the top of the window. On the left-hand side is a drop-down menu that should be set to “Model” by default. This drop-down menu allows you to switch between workspaces that are set up for different tasks (see <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>).</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_12"/><a id="ch02fig5"/><img src="Images/02fig05.jpg" alt="Images" width="752" height="583"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 2-5: Switching workspaces for access to menus and toolbars</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Switching workspaces should give you access to other toolbars and menu options. Here, you’ll find a list of workspaces along with a brief summary:</p>&#13;
<p class="hang"><strong>Model</strong> This is the workspace you’ll probably use the most. It contains all of the <em>solid modeling</em> tools, which means that everything you model could potentially exist as a real physical object.</p>&#13;
<p class="hang"><strong>Patch</strong> This workspace contains all of the <em>surface modeling</em> features. You’ll learn a bit about surface modeling in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07">Chapter 7</a>, but this book will mostly focus on solid modeling.</p>&#13;
<p class="hang"><strong>Render</strong> This workspace contains tools for creating high-quality renders of your 3D models, typically for presentation purposes. <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09">Chapter 9</a> covers the basics of creating renders.</p>&#13;
<p class="hang"><strong>Animation</strong> This workspace lets you animate assemblies in order to illustrate how the movement of a machine (for example) will work. Although this book doesn’t cover animation, I suggest you play around in this workspace.</p>&#13;
<p class="hang"><strong>Simulation</strong> You can use this workspace for strength testing and stress-analysis simulations, which are also outside the scope of this book.</p>&#13;
<p class="hang"><strong>CAM</strong> Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) is one of the major selling points of Autodesk Fusion 360. It allows you to create toolpaths and program various <em>computer numerical control</em> (<em>CNC</em>) machines. CAM is a complex topic, so it isn’t covered in this book.</p>&#13;
<p class="hang"><strong>Drawing</strong> Here, you can create technical drawings that you can use for manufacturing, filing patents, or simply illustrating your model. You’ll learn more about this workspace and topic in <a href="ch08.xhtml#ch08">Chapter 8</a>.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec16"><strong><em><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_13"/>Navigating Around the Model Workspace</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The Model workspace is where you’ll do most of your work. Navigate to that workspace and take a look around the screen, which should be divided into several key areas, as shown in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="ch02fig6"/><img src="Images/02fig06.jpg" alt="Images" width="923" height="577"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 2-6: The Model workspace</em></p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li class="noindent">The <em>Ribbon</em> is the main toolbar where you’ll find the sketches and features for creating solid models, along with a few other miscellaneous tools. Generally, you’ll work left to right—starting with Sketch, moving to Create, then Modify, and so on.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Your Autodesk account options, help, and Fusion 360 preferences and options are accessible via the dropdown menu.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">The <em>Component Browser</em> shows you the views, planes, and other construction geometry you’ve created—some are created by default. For now, you’ll just be working with one component at a time, but if there were more than one, you’d select them here.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">The <em>View Cube</em> allows you to rotate your 3D model in space and quickly orient the viewport to face a particular side of the model.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">The <em>Design History Timeline</em> updates as you create sketches, features, and construction geometry. This maintains a history of everything you do and allows you to go back and make changes as needed.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Additional view tools for orbiting your model, fitting it to the window, panning, and zooming.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Various display settings and options. You can use this toolbar to change the look and feel of the workspace and model, to set up the view grid and determine how it acts, and to divide the view window into multiple viewports.</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_14"/>The <em>viewport</em> is where you’ll be actually interacting with your 3D models (see <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>). This is an essentially infinite space where the model will exist. Because you haven’t created a model yet, you should see a grid laid out over a plane composed of two axes—in this case, the x-axis and z-axis—and centered on the <em>origin</em>, which is the point where the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis all meet.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="ch02fig7"/><img src="Images/02fig07.jpg" alt="Images" width="928" height="581"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 2-7: The viewport is where you will interact with your 3D model.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Use the View Cube to rotate the viewport around the origin and a model, or use the orbit tool from the Navigation toolbar to freely orbit or rotate the model. Holding down the scroll wheel of your mouse pans the toolbar. Zoom in and out with the magnifying-glass buttons at the bottom of the window, or pan the viewport by selecting the hand icon from the View toolbar. You can also pan with your mouse wheel or two fingers on laptop touchpads.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec17"><strong><em>Understanding the Model Workspace’s Main Toolbar</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Each workspace has its own main toolbar, and the Model workspace’s toolbar contains everything you need for solid modeling. A 2D plane can only exist as either a surface or as <em>reference geometry</em>, which means it isn’t part of the solid model. This is because a 2D model has no thickness, so it isn’t physically possible to create in the real world. Working with solid models ensures that the parts you create are (theoretically, at least) actually makeable. This is in contrast to surface modeling, where you have the ability to create surfaces that have zero thickness, which is physically impossible.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_15"/>In the following chapters, you’ll learn how to use each tool in the Model workspace. But for now, here is a brief overview of the drop-down menus in the main toolbar (<a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>):</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="ch02fig8"/><img src="Images/02fig08.jpg" alt="Images" width="926" height="157"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 2-8: The Model workspace’s main toolbar</em></p>&#13;
<p class="hang"><strong>Sketch</strong> The various tools for creating a sketch and drawing within the sketches you create.</p>&#13;
<p class="hang"><strong>Create</strong> This is where you’ll find the tools for creating solids. Some of these require a sketch, but there are also features for creating basic primitives without the need for a sketch.</p>&#13;
<p class="hang"><strong>Modify</strong> Features for modifying an existing solid, such as adding a fillet to round the edges of a 3D model. This drop-down also has options for setting the <em>material</em> and <em>appearance</em> of your model. Setting the material allows you to calculate things like the mass and to perform simulations. Appearance just affects how the model looks, which is useful when creating renders. This is also where you’ll find your custom parameters.</p>&#13;
<p class="hang"><strong>Assemble</strong> The tools for putting together multiple components to form an assembly. This is useful for checking to make sure your parts all fit together, testing their motion, and creating assembly drawings.</p>&#13;
<p class="hang"><strong>Construct</strong> All of the <em>construction geometry</em>, including nonsolid planes, lines, and points that are used to assist in modeling, but which have no actual three-dimensional substance themselves.</p>&#13;
<p class="hang"><strong>Inspect</strong> This is where you’ll find a host of tools you can use to analyze your model. Most commonly, you’ll use the Measure tool to perform basic tasks like checking the distance from one point to another, but there are also tools for checking the center of gravity, drafting (for molding), and a lot more.</p>&#13;
<p class="hang"><strong>Insert</strong> Use this to bring external resources into your model. For instance, when creating high-quality renders, you might want to insert a <em>decal</em>—an image file—for something like the printed face of a dial. You can also pull in external DXF and SVG files (two-dimensional line drawings), and 3D mesh files, like STL files, which you may use for 3D printing.</p>&#13;
<p class="hang"><strong>Make</strong> Mostly used for 3D printing, this drop-down menu has an option to export an STL file. It also has utilities for uploading your model to various paid 3D printing services.</p>&#13;
<p class="hang"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_16"/><strong>Add-Ins</strong> There are a number of first- and third-party add-ins available for Fusion 360 that give you tools for specialized tasks. You can find them here.</p>&#13;
<p class="hang"><strong>Select</strong> Most of the time, the default selection options work just fine, but once your sketches, models, and assemblies get complex, it can sometimes be difficult to actually click the thing you’re trying to select. This drop-down menu gives you options for only selecting particular parts of the sketch or geometry in those situations.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec18"><strong>Summary</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Now that you have a basic understanding of the interface and workspace, feel free to play around with the different options and settings. If you feel like you’ve accidentally messed up your settings, you can always revert to the defaults by clicking the username in the top right-hand corner and then clicking <strong>Preferences</strong> ▸ <strong>Restore Defaults</strong>.</p>&#13;

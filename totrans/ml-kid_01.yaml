    which identifies what those pictures have in common and uses that to recognize
    new pictures.*

    of photos to help people with visual disabilities know what’s in photos even if
    they can’t see them. Social media websites use it to recognize the faces of our
    friends and family in the photos we post. Companies use it to track when their
    logos or products are included in photos posted online so they know when they’re
    being talked about on social media. More importantly, doctors use it to help them
    recognize medical conditions in patients’ scans and photos. Doctors need to remember
    many different symptoms and signs of illness, so image recognition systems can
    help them by identifying things like skin tumors in photographs or cancer in a
    microscopic picture of a cell.

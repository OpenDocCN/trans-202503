    They reflect your personality or that of your organization and present what you
    most want others to know or remember about you. Like in a three-line haiku, you
    have a limited space to make a clear, original, and memorable statement that may
    well have a longer life than your current website.

    to follow the steps exactly (unless you just want to learn the techniques). If
    you plan to create a business card, look at more examples than these two, and
    play with Inkscape to combine the best design tricks shown here with something
    original. Creativity cannot be taught, but it can be inspired. Inkscape will serve
    you whether you're being artistic or creating a perfectly traditional design.

    card size** list, and click **Create from template**. This opens a new Inkscape
    window with the properly sized business card canvas. The examples in this tutorial

    Make them all independent objects (click and type each one separately) because
    you''re going to move them around a lot, trying different layouts. If you want
    to display a logo on your card, import the logo file ([18.2](c18.xhtml#section18.2)).

    to help personalize your design. If you're interested in graphic design, you likely
    have a library of favorite fonts; otherwise, a few basic (but good) fonts usually
    come with your operating system, and you can find many high-quality (and inexpensive)
    fonts online.

    for this design, as it’s aesthetically pleasing and features broad Unicode coverage.
    After assigning the same font to all the text strings, play with their relative
    sizes using the Selector ([Figure 20-2](#fig20-2)).

- en: When making a template for multiple business cards (or other design items),
    you need to leave extra space for variable-length names and addresses. However,
    I'm making a card only for myself, which frees me from this requirement and allows
    me to position and align all text objects precisely. I was able to push all the
    address bits closely against the name, creating an asymmetric composition tightly
    bound together by its alignments (the address is aligned with the start of the
    last name, the email with the top of the name, and so on), as shown in [Figure 20-3](#fig20-3).

    thing to try was to select all (Ctrl-A) and rotate (press [ once). Much better!
    The design now has a flair of constructivism—a short-lived but influentional design
    movement of the 1920s that espoused bold contrasts and text running at an angle.
    Let''s develop this style further: add three black corners intruding into the
    composition from the edges and place a big red circle in the center of the composition
    ([Figure 20-4](#fig20-4)). Constructivists loved simple geometric forms in black
    and red!'

    spacing between all letters in the text) and kerning (intervals within specific
    letter pairs). In the Text tool, use the controls bar (**Spacing between letters**
    and **Horizontal kerning** numeric values) to adjust those parameters; for kerning,
    you could also use Alt-arrows to change the interval at the text cursor ([15.4.4](c15.xhtml#section15.4.4)).
    Generally, large text objects look better with tighter letter spacing, while small
    type needs increased letter spacing for readability.

    designing a personal business card and want to it to be more personable, add a
    photo that you can additionally trace ([18.5](c18.xhtml#section18.5)) and then
    tweak as vectors. You could also use a piece of clipart ([1.3](c01.xhtml#section1.3))

    I switched to the Calligraphic pen, set the Angle to 90 degrees with a Fixation
    of 100 and drew a couple of intertwined letters. I finally got the letter shapes
    more or less right, but the result was at best mildly interesting. I tried to
    improve it by unioning the path objects and then simplifying, insetting, and outsetting
    it a few times, as [Figure 20-5](#fig20-5) demonstrates.'

    "Don't be too neat" is a viable design strategy; if you can smear, distort, or
    damage your art in a creative way, go ahead and do it. With this approach in mind,
    I selected a somewhat narrower pen nib, maximized Tremor to 100, and danced wildly
    around the letters with my tablet pen ([Figure 20-6](#fig20-6)). Using a mouse
    for this effect would work almost as well. The result appeared unattractive at
    first because I forgot to apply the usual Simplify/Inset/Outset magic.

    rest placed symmetrically around it. I used a plain, slanted, very light sans
    serif font (Helvetica Condensed Light) that doesn't distract from the artwork
    in the center. The horizontal layout made the card seem cramped so I rotated everything
    on its side (by pressing Ctrl-[) to give the art ample space and allow the text
    to float to the edges and not interfere with the artwork, as shown in [Figure 20-7](#fig20-7).

    looked too empty, flat, and hostile with the irregular blotch of ink in the center.
    To fix this, I decided to add some background gradients.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As explained in [10.6](c10.xhtml#section10.6), the default gradient from opacity
    1 to opacity 0 of a given color (for example, blue) looks crude, because its boundary
    is clearly visible upon white even when you use a pale color. To improve the look
    of a gradient over a white background, paint the transparent end of the gradient
    white, instead of the same color as the other end.

    at the edges of the card to achieve a softly blending, naturally bending, asymmetric
    look. In [Figure 20-8](#fig20-8), the dashed lines are the bounding boxes of the
    four rectangles with gradients, and the gradient lines show each gradient’s span
    and direction. I painted the initials dark blue and added a blurred, 50 percent
    opaque drop shadow to the letters (Filters ▶ Shadows and Glows ▶ Drop Shadow).

    stock pattern. Using pattern adjustment handles in the Node tool ([10.8.1](c10.xhtml#section10.8.1)),
    I rotated the stripes and scaled them down. Finally, I stepped the rectangle in
    z-order above the gradients and the initials but below the text, and reduced its
    opacity to 20 percent.

    enough to render any design, be it this tutorial's first card (no transparency
    or gradients, a collection of fully opaque shapes) or the second one (opacity,
    gradients, and even filters for the drop shadow on the initials). What needs to
    be rasterized will be rasterized, and text objects will either have their fonts
    embedded or be converted to paths on export.

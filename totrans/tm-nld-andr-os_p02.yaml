- en: Much like it is tricky to build the penthouse apartment in a skyscraper before
    having the foundation and fifty stories below it, it was difficult to build Android
    applications without having the underlying OS kernel, graphics system, framework,
    UI toolkit, APIs, and other fundamental layers that those applications would need.
    Because thereâ€™s nothing worse than walking into your new penthouse apartment and
    falling down all the way to street level.

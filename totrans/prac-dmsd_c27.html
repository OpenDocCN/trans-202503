			<p class="ChapterIntro">In a hyperpolarized world, ignorance becomes a point of pride, and there are few places where the phenomenon is more evident than in the ongoing debate about the individual right to bear arms. In the United States, which has more guns than people,<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c27-endnote-1" id="c27-noteref-1">1</a></sup> deliberate firearm illiteracy is the only explanation for the comical errors in big-ticket Hollywood productions or the endless stream of befuddling and contradictory gun control bills.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, in Europe, where the history books document centuries of near-constant conflict and conquest, the prevailing dogma is that citizens will never again have to take up arms to defend their families or land. As for the pro-gun side on the new continent, many of the movement’s most devoted supporters have their own flavor of reality: feverish visions of totalitarian globalist forces coming for their freedoms, mixed with the siren song of the American Revolution, Part Deux.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_212" title="212"/>In a world plagued by partisan dogma, making considered decisions about personal risk is difficult. To remedy this, my hope is that this final chapter of the book will offer those less versed in firearms a practical understanding of the capabilities and dangers of such tools—without convincing readers that gun ownership is their patriotic duty, nor that it’s a symptom of a small and diseased mind.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c27-0001">Handguns</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Handguns are a class of small, low-powered firearms that, generally speaking, can be carried without attracting attention or interfering with everyday tasks. As noted in the previous chapter, most handguns have a fairly modest stopping power: absent expert aim, multiple rounds may be required to dissuade an angry bear or a homicidal maniac from continuing an assault.</p>
			<p>
				For most novices, the practical range of a handgun is about 10 yards, and even at that distance, accuracy can vary. A telling statistic is that in shootouts, police have a hit rate of perhaps 35 percent.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c27-endnote-2" id="c27-noteref-2">2</a></sup> A well-recognized contributing factor to such dismal performance is the spike in adrenaline that happens in high-stress situations and tends to obliterate fine-motor skills.</p>
			<p>When poor aim and poor stopping power conspire, capacity matters more than most gun skeptics suspect. Some regulators and gun control activists have variously floated three, five, seven, or ten rounds as the limit of what a civilian may reasonably need for self-defense; to me, this is an overly simplistic take. But no matter: whether legislators limit you to one, five, or a hundred rounds, let’s have a look at some of the major types of handguns available on the market, and the pros and cons of each.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-502123c27-0001">Semiautomatic Pistols</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Semiautomatic pistols are a true marvel of engineering. This type of gun diverts some of the energy of the previously fired cartridge to perform a carefully choreographed sequence of operations: extracting and ejecting the spent casing, chambering a new round, and possibly cocking the spring-loaded firing mechanism to prime it for the next shot. The whole cycle takes about 50 milliseconds. When taken apart, semiautos look simple, but they’re the pinnacle of hundreds of years of advances in metallurgy, propellant and cartridge design, and more.</p>
			<p>The most important advantage of semiauto handguns is their capacity, typically ranging from 6 to 18 rounds that are housed in a removable magazine in the grip. As discussed, the challenges of handgun accuracy make this an important selling point. On the flip side, the disadvantage is the complex user interface. The firearm can be in multiple conditions—cocked or uncocked, with an empty or loaded chamber, with the safety on or off—and this can confuse less experienced users, somewhat increasing the likelihood of the gun not firing when needed or discharging when handled negligently.</p>
			<p>
				The reliability of semiautos is somewhat debatable too. Compared to the intricate internals of revolvers, they may be less likely to suffer a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_213" title="213"/>catastrophic mechanical failure, but every semiauto pistol owner will probably sooner or later experience a jam—a failure to fully eject a spent casing or fully chamber a new round. Such problems can be resolved fairly easily, but practice is needed to build the muscle memory; without it, the operator risks standing doe-eyed, trying to understand why the gun only goes “click.”</p>
			<h3 id="h2-502123c27-0002">Revolvers</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Revolvers are a more ancient type of a repeating firearm, typically holding five or six rounds in a nonremovable cylinder that’s mechanically rotated with every pull of the trigger. Compared to semiautos, the interface of a revolver is simple and unlikely to confound a novice. On the other hand, the lower capacity of these firearms gives you fewer chances to land the decisive shot. The absence of removable magazines also means that reloading is slow and almost never attempted in the field.</p>
			<p>Because a revolver has no metal moving back and forth to redirect and dissipate the energy of the fired cartridge, firing it may be less pleasant compared to a semiauto of the same chambering and weight. In a revolver, the bulk of the recoil is a single sharp impulse that goes straight into your wrists. That said, both revolvers and semiauto pistols can be chosen in a way that provides a comfortable shooting experience while still packing enough punch. This is done by matching the size of the weapon to the type of the cartridge and the physique of the shooter, rather than choosing the most powerful cartridge or the most compact firearm one can find.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-502123c27-0003">Other Concealable Firearms</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Many other handgun designs can be used for self-defense. Two classic examples are single-shot pistols and double-barrel derringers. Such guns tend to be remarkably compact. Because of this, they’re often imagined as ankle-worn backup for those who expect to find themselves caught in the middle of an improbable movie plot. In real situations, the extremely limited capacity of such a weapon is probably not worth the benefit.</p>
			<p>More bizarre designs tend to crop up with regularity too. The past several decades have seen developments ranging from two-barrel revolvers to credit-card “survival guns.” Buyer beware: although such contraptions make for good internet memes and can become prized collectibles once the manufacturer inevitably goes belly up, there are darn good reasons most of these ideas don’t catch on.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-502123c27-0004">Deciding on Handgun Caliber and Size</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">As hinted earlier, new gun buyers have the tendency to go with the smallest possible weapon and the most potent cartridge available at their local gun store. That’s a mistake. Such firearms deliver punishing recoil that discourages routine range practice and prevents novices from honing their skills. Accuracy tends to suffer too. Stubby barrels mean that visually aligning the front and rear sights produces far less precise aim.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_214" title="214"/>For practical semiauto handguns, the gold standard of cartridges is the 9mm Luger, and this caliber works particularly well in mid- to full-sized pistols. Popular all-around options range from the budget-conscious polymer-framed Glock 19 to the sharp-looking and all-metal Sig Sauer P229.</p>
			<p>
				Although subcompact pistols are also available in the 9mm caliber, they tend to be too snappy for many tastes, and this is especially true with more lightweight designs. For instance, the 16-ounce Glock 43 is far less pleasant to shoot than the 27-ounce Springfield EMP, despite both having a comparable size. In rare situations where extreme concealability is more important than stopping power, tiny pistols firing comparatively lower-powered .380 ACP rounds<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c27-footnote-1" id="c27-footnoteref-1">*</a></sup> may be a better choice; in this department, Ruger LCP and Kahr Arms CW380 are two fine picks.</p>
			<p>For revolvers, the optimal cartridge is probably .38 Special, a type of ammunition that’s a fairly close counterpart of the aforementioned 9mm Luger round common in the world of semiauto pistols. Many revolvers can use .38 Special interchangeably with the more powerful .357 Magnum, but in most cases, the magnum caliber is too overpowered for range practice or home defense uses. Practical and easily carried revolvers include the well-regarded Ruger SP101, the sleek-looking Kimber K6s, or the space-age Chiappa Rhino 30DS. More easily concealable options are available too; in that category, the lightweight Ruger LCR is of note.</p>
			<p>The brands and models named here are just examples. Countless manufacturers are out there, and few truly bad firearms. Keeping in mind the size and cartridge trade-offs mentioned in this section, it’s safe to pick what looks nice, fits in your budget, and feels right in your hand.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c27-0002">Long Guns</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Although there’s considerable variability among products, long guns tend to fire projectiles with much greater energy than a pistol would. For rifles, the bulk of this increase has to do with speed, with bullets commonly traveling as fast as 3,000 feet per second (compared to handgun velocities around 1,000 ft/sec). For shotguns, the gains typically come from much heavier projectiles, weighing perhaps four to eight times as much as a 9mm round.</p>
			<p>Long barrels and high-speed projectiles produce more predictable trajectories; a longer firearm is also easier to aim. Because of these factors, even a complete novice wielding a long gun should be able to put holes on paper 50 to 100 yards away, and some high-powered rifles with expensive optics may work to 1,000 yards or more.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_215" title="215"/>On the flip side, long guns are far less versatile than handguns. They’re unwieldy and impossible to carry without alerting strangers or spooking guests. For the same reasons, rifles and shotguns make for a questionable addition to a typical bug-out kit. Although they may have some uses in the wilderness, the sheer weight of a long gun and a couple boxes of ammo means that other, possibly more useful items would need to be left behind.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-502123c27-0005">Rifles</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">In some respects, rifles can be thought of as powerful handguns with extended barrels. Just like a pistol or a revolver, they fire a single spin-stabilized projectile, typically made of copper or lead. In contrast to handguns, however, rifles vary quite considerably when it comes to mechanical operation. There are single-shot and semiautomatic varieties, but also lever-action guns familiar from westerns, bolt-action flavors commonly associated with hunting and long-range marksmanship, and more.</p>
			<p>The ammunition-feeding devices seen on rifles are more varied too. Many modern designs, such as the ubiquitous AR-15, use detachable box magazines, but permanently built-in ammunition-feeding devices are also common. For example, a lever gun may have a tubular magazine sitting right under the barrel and extending throughout the length of the gun.</p>
			<p>For most shooters looking for an affordable and reliable multipurpose rifle, there may be no special reason to look past an AR-15 clone designed for .223 Remington or 5.56×45mm NATO. This is the most popular rifle in America, and it enjoys this status not because of exceptional lethality, but simply because it’s an inexpensive and well thought-out design that can be customized in nearly infinite ways.</p>
			<p>
				The most significant drawback of the platform is just its reputation. Its aggressive styling earned it the somewhat meaningless moniker of an <em>assault weapon</em>, prompting a variety of restrictions and bans. Those who want to own an AR-15 but who live in a restrictive state may want to check out the sleek FightLite SCR, designed to accept many AR-15 accessories while staying clear of the cosmetic features banned in certain states. Meanwhile, buyers put off by any association with the AR-15 brand might want to consider a less menacing wooden-stocked rifle, such as the venerable Ruger Mini-14.</p>
			<p>A  subjective drawback of the AR-15 platform is that part of the reciprocating mechanism responsible for chambering new rounds extends in a straight line into the stock. Although this offers benefits, it makes the butt of the gun sit at a rather unnatural angle, requiring the optics to be mounted higher and the shooter to rubberneck a bit. Between the high-mounted optics and the protruding pistol grip, the AR-15 is also very tall, taking up a lot of space in any gun safe. Interestingly, this problem isn’t present on the FightLite SCR, which uses an angled mechanism and a traditional stock geometry while—again—retaining most of the other features of an AR-15.</p>
			<p>
				My final and still-unconvincing critique of the AR-15 platform is that it’s perhaps a bit <em>too</em> customizable. Many alterations that look interesting to gun owners make the rifle more difficult or less pleasant to use in the real <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_216" title="216"/>world. Muzzle brakes and short barrels live in special infamy: they greatly increase the likelihood of hearing damage if the gun is ever used for self-defense indoors.</p>
			<p>For those who can’t get or don’t want a semiautomatic long gun, a lever-action carbine is probably the best alternative. These weapons offer a solid magazine capacity—usually 7 to 14 rounds—and can be fired far more quickly than a bolt-action firearm. Large-caliber hunting rifles may be tempting for their survivalist allure, but in home defense situations are best avoided; they suffer from excessive penetration and pack too much recoil for many novices.</p>
			<p>On the other end of the spectrum, rifles designed to take pistol cartridges have merit. Compared to a handgun, they offer much greater accuracy and somewhat improved range. Popular pistol-caliber carbines include Henry Big Boy in .38 Special and Ruger PC and KelTec SUB2000 in 9mm Luger.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-502123c27-0006">Shotguns</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">While a rifle may be thought of as a scaled-up handgun, shotguns are more like scaled-down cannons. They’re large-bore weapons, often with smooth barrels, and are designed to propel all kinds of payloads when the delivery of a devastating force is more important than precise aim. The projectiles fired by shotguns range from massive metal slugs that can stop a grizzly to clusters of tiny lead balls that can be fired in the general direction of a flying game bird. As noted earlier, a shotgun can also fire less-lethal rubber batons and bean bags for use in crowd or animal control.</p>
			<p>Shotguns make for a dependable home defense weapon, both because of the versatility of the loads and simply because they can appear far more fearsome than a small pistol held in a shaky hand. Another important consideration is that in some countries, shotguns are subject to fewer restrictions than other types of firearms. This is usually in recognition of their role for farmland predator control.</p>
			<p>
				The most significant drawback of this class of firearms is their punishing recoil. Although many shooters like to brag about how they can take the punishment in stride, the reality is that any extended range session will leave you sore—and if you don’t brace the gun perfectly, bruises are likely to follow too. Small-bore shotguns, capable of taking 20-gauge<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c27-footnote-2" id="c27-footnoteref-2">*</a></sup> or .410-caliber shotshells, are available on the market and are much easier to manage—but the choice of ammunition is far more constrained, and the reduction in power has obvious downsides.</p>
			<p>
				The predominant shotgun bore size is 12 gauge (about 0.73 inches), and the most common design is a tube-fed pump-action—a mechanism found on the Remington 870, Mossberg 590, and countless other models from manufacturers big and small. That said, for shooters who want to take some edge off the recoil without tacking on an oversized shoulder pad, a semiautomatic shotgun can offer substantial relief; here, Remington V3 is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_217" title="217"/>probably the best pick in its class. The gotcha is that a semiauto may not cycle reliably with low-power shells, such as rubber baton rounds; the mechanism is factory-calibrated for conventional loads that pack far more punch.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c27-0003">Ammunition</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">For handguns and rifles, ammunition comes in two basic varieties. <em>Full metal jacket (FMJ) </em>bullets are made of solid metal and tend to pass through soft materials without deforming to a significant extent. <em>Jacketed hollow point (JHP) </em>ammunition has a small cavity in the front of the bullet, sometimes filled back with plastic. On impact, the pressure inside this cavity rapidly builds up, causing the bullet to mushroom and decelerate.</p>
			<p>
				A less common in-between variant is known as <em>soft-point.</em> This ammunition has a solid core made from soft metal and a jacket made of a harder alloy, enclosing everything but the tip. At rifle velocities, such a cartridge tends to “pancake,” somewhat similarly to JHP.</p>
			<p>FMJ ammunition is commonly used for target practice, primarily because of its lower cost. Hollow-point bullets are preferred for self-defense because they deliver their energy to the intended target more efficiently and are less likely to overpenetrate and hit bystanders. At the same time, because it’s reputed to cause more severe wounds, JHP ammunition is banned in some parts of the world. Still, where legal, it’s the more rational pick. However morbid this sounds, you don’t pull the trigger when you want to cause only a tiny bit of harm.</p>
			<p>
				For shotguns, the ammo choices are different. There are three basic types of shotshells: bird shot, buckshot, and slugs. <em>Bird shot</em> consists of hundreds of tiny metal spheres, traveling independently and meant to take out waterfowl and other critters. Bird shot is common in hunting but may not pack enough punch and not offer sufficient precision in self-defense situations that involve distances of more than perhaps 10 yards. <em>Buckshot</em> is a variation of this idea, consisting of a smaller number of much larger projectiles, each delivering about as much damage as a pistol round. When fired from the distance of about 10 to 15 yards, buckshot will impact an area roughly the size of the palm of your hand and will almost certainly kill anything in its path. Finally, <em>slugs</em> are single bullets of considerable size and mass. When they hit something, they punch a rather massive hole. They’re about as lethal as buckshot, but remain accurate and effective over longer distances—at the expense of requiring better aim.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c27-0004">Firearm Safety Rules</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Although gun owners are commonly stereotyped as reckless, the gun community deserves praise for developing an impressive and simple set of safety rules that—if taken to heart—ensure that multiple things would need to go wrong at once to cause a dangerous accident.</p>
			<p>
				The first rule of gun safety is simple: when picking up a gun, assume that it’s loaded. Many accidents happen because people trust their memory, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_218" title="218"/>their habits, or the assurances of others—but mistakes happen, and with a deadly tool, it’s essential to double-check. If you don’t know how to clear a particular gun of ammunition, it’s crucial to ask for help or check on the internet before messing with it. In semiautomatic firearms with removable magazines, always check the chamber <em>after</em> removing the mag. Removing the magazine alone isn’t a guarantee of safety. Although some firearms may be designed not to fire without a magazine, this isn’t universally true—and the interlock mechanism that ensures this property can malfunction too.</p>
			<p>The second rule is rooted in the assumption that you’ll eventually mess up rule 1, and it stipulates that when handling a gun, you should always keep it pointed somewhere safe. At the shooting range, this is toward the backstop. At home, the safest direction may be toward the ground. Accidentally muzzle-sweeping other people when manipulating a gun is a serious faux pas.</p>
			<p>The third rule assumes that you might eventually break rules 1 and 2; it instructs you to keep your finger off the trigger until the gun is aimed at the target and you’re ready to fire. The simplest way to accomplish this is to rest your index finger on the frame or the stock of the firearm just above the trigger guard. This quickly becomes a habit. You can often spot gun owners by looking at how people hold a cordless drill, a sprayer bottle, or a similar household tool.</p>
			<p>The final rule is to know your target and what’s behind it. This can mean several things. During outdoor target practice, you may want to place the target against a hill or other natural feature that will stop any stray rounds. In self-defense situations, it means you must positively identify your target and take note of any people nearby. You don’t want to shoot a drunk family member or a confused neighbor in the middle of the night.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c27-0005">Firearm Storage</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">A carelessly stored weapon is an unnecessary risk. A gun can be taken by a burglar and used in the commission of violent crimes, or it may be grabbed by a curious toddler; even if you don’t have children, friends may one day visit you with their offspring in tow. Some recalcitrant gun owners argue that when an intruder sneaks in, every moment counts, so a gun should be easily accessible. That said, with modern electronic locks, the ability to pull a gun out of a safe is just a split second away.</p>
			<p>
				Gun safes are available in all shapes and sizes, from small handgun vaults that can be fitted inside a nightstand drawer to behemoths weighing 1,000 pounds or more. The cheapest products can be more accurately described as locking cabinets: they’re made of thin steel and are meant to deter casual access, but many can be pried open with a bit of work. Once you get to the price tag of about $800 to $1,000, the security gets more substantial: the products are designed to withstand sustained attacks with hand tools, but may still succumb rather quickly to angle grinders or circular <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_219" title="219"/>saws with the correct blade. Higher-security safes may be rated for power tool use—but tend to cost a lot, quite possibly more than the valuables one wants to put inside.</p>
			<p>In contrast to safes, the merits of other safety devices marketed to gun owners are far less clear-cut. Cable locks that obstruct the action of the firearm do nothing to deter theft—and can be cut off with rudimentary tools; fiddling with keys in the middle of the night seems rather undesirable as well. Trigger locks may be marginally better but are even more frustrating to undo. Sophisticated electronic locks sound nice in theory and can be manipulated fairly quickly—but are finicky and prone to failure if the battery runs out.</p>
			<p>If you have children, keeping the gun out of their reach is essential, but it’s probably a mistake to keep the kids in the dark. A much better strategy is to explain the dangers, teach them the rules, and then allow them to examine the weapon or try it out at the range under close supervision. The less mysterious the item, the less likely they are to do something dumb if you accidentally leave it on the table some fateful day—or if they find an abandoned firearm in the grass on their way home from school.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c27-0006">Getting Good</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Knowing how to handle and store a firearm isn’t enough. For one, because the loud sound, the flash, and the force of recoil can be startling, many novice shooters quickly develop a flinch that takes time to go away. It’s common for a new shooter to place the first shot perfectly on target and then subsequently drift away, with true aim not coming back until several range sessions down the line. Many other aspects of gun ownership come down to muscle memory too. For example, it takes time to get used to the force needed to pull back the slide on a semiautomatic pistol, and to learn how to grasp it firmly without pinching any skin.</p>
			<p>The gun community tends to go overboard with complex tactical drills. Most gun owners don’t need to train like US Navy SEALs, but they should get comfortable with their firearm. It’s good to visit your local range every weekend or so until you build some confidence. Past that point, you should refresh your knowledge every couple of months.</p>
			<p>Speaking of range time, it must be noted that recreational shooting is a source of exposure to lead, especially for frequent visitors to poorly ventilated indoor ranges and for those who reload ammunition at home. If you’re willing to spend a bit more, reducing this risk is possible by using ammo made with fully encapsulated lead or solid copper bullets and nontoxic primers. Brands available in the United States include RUAG Copper Matrix, Magtech Clean Range, Winchester Super Clean, Federal BallistiClean, Remington Disintegrator, and Federal Power-Shok Copper. Basic hygiene, such as thoroughly scrubbing your hands after a range trip, can go a long way too.</p>

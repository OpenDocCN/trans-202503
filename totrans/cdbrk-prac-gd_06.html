<p class="BodyFirst"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_86" title="86"/>Among the best-known cryptograms in the world are three ciphertexts published in an 1885 pamphlet titled <em>The Beale Papers</em>.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c06-endnote-1" id="c06-noteref-1">1</a></sup> Referred to as the “Beale ciphers,” they were allegedly created by a Virginian buffalo hunter named Thomas Beale in the 1820s to conceal the location of a gold treasure buried somewhere in Bedford County, Virginia. </p>
<p>Although we and many other crypto experts believe that the whole Beale story is a mere hoax (Thomas Beale, let alone his treasure, probably never existed), the three ciphertexts are interesting to study. Messages #1 and #3 are unsolved and, therefore, covered in the <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_“Unsolved cryptograms">“Unsolved cryptograms</span><span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_” ">” </span>section of this chapter. The second Beale cryptogram is solvable using the Declaration of Independence, a version of which is reproduced in the pamphlet. </p>
<p>The encrypted version of the second message reads as follows:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>115, 73, 24, 807, 37, 52, 49, 17, 31, 62, 647, 22, 7, 15, 140, 47, 29, 107, 79, 84, 56, 239, 10, 26, 811, 5, 196, 308, 85, 52, 160, 136, 59, 211, 36, 9, 46, 316, 554, 122, 106, 95, 53, 58, 2, 42, 7, 35, 122, 53, 31, 82, 77, 250, 196, 56, 96, 118, 71, 140, 287, 28, 353, 37, 1005, 65, 147, 807, 24, 3, 8, 12, 47, 43, 59, 807, 45, 316, 101, 41, 78, 154, 1005, 122, 138, 191, 16, 77, 49, 102, 57, 72, 34, 73, 85, 35, 371, 59, 196, 81, 92, 191, 106, 273, 60, 394, 620, 270, 220, 106, 388, 287, 63, 3, 6, 191, 122, 43, 234, 400, 106, 290, 314, 47, 48, 81, 96, 26, 115, 92, 158, 191, 110, 77, 85, 197, 46, 10, 113, 140, 353, 48, 120, 106, 2, 607, 61, 420, 811, 29, 125, 14, 20, 37, 105, 28, 248, 16, 159, 7, 35, 19, 301, 125, 110, 486, 287, 98, 117, 511, 62, 51, 220, 37, 113, 140, 807, 138, 540, 8, 44, 287, 388, 117, 18, 79, 344, 34, 20, 59, 511, 548, 107, 603, 220, 7, 66, 154, 41, 20, 50, 6, 575, 122, 154, 248, 110, 61, 52, 33, 30, 5, 38, 8, 14, 84, 57, 540, 217, 115, 71, 29, 84, 63, 43, 131, 29, 138, 47, 73, 239, 540, 52, 53, 79, 118, 51, 44, 63, 196, 12, 239, 112, 3, 49, 79, 353, 105, 56, 371, 557, 211, 505, 125, 360, 133, 143, 101, 15, 284, 540, 252, 14, 205, 140, 344, 26, 811, 138, 115, 48, 73, 34, 205, 316, 607, 63, 220, 7, 52, 150, 44, 52, 16, 40, 37, 158, 807, 37, 121, 12, 95, 10, 15, 35, 12, 131, 62, 115, 102, 807, 49, 53, 135, 138, 30, 31, 62, 67, 41, 85, 63, 10, 106, 807, 138, 8, 113, 20, 32, 33, 37, 353, 287, 140, 47, 85, 50, 37, 49, 47, 64, 6, 7, 71, 33, 4, 43, 47, 63, 1, 27, 600, 208, 230, 15, 191, 246, 85, 94, 511, 2, 270, 20, 39, 7, 33, 44, 22, 40, 7, 10, 3, 811, 106, 44, 486, 230, 353, 211, 200, 31, 10, 38, 140, 297, 61, 603, 320, 302, 666, 287, 2, 44, 33, 32, 511, 548, 10, 6, 250, 557, 246, 53, 37, 52, 83, 47, 320, 38, 33, 807, 7, 44, 30, 31, 250, 10, 15, 35, 106, 160, 113, 31, 102, 406, 230, 540, 320, 29, 66, 33, 101, 807, 138, 301, 316, 353, 320, 220, 37, 52, 28, 540, 320, 33, 8, 48, 107, 50, 811, 7, 2, 113, 73, 16, 125, 11, 110, 67, 102, 807, 33, 59, 81, 158, 38, 43, 581, 138, 19, 85, 400, 38, 43, 77, 14, 27, 8, 47, 138, 63, 140, 44, 35, 22, 177, 106, 250, 314, 217, 2, 10, 7, 1005, 4, 20, 25, 44, 48, 7, 26, 46, 110, 230, 807, 191, 34, 112, 147, 44, 110, 121, 125, 96, 41, 51, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_87" title="87"/>50, 140, 56, 47, 152, 540, 63, 807, 28, 42, 250, 138, 582, 98, 643, 32, 107, 140, 112, 26, 85, 138, 540, 53, 20, 125, 371, 38, 36, 10, 52, 118, 136, 102, 420, 150, 112, 71, 14, 20, 7, 24, 18, 12, 807, 37, 67, 110, 62, 33, 21, 95, 220, 511, 102, 811, 30, 83, 84, 305, 620, 15, 2, 108, 220, 106, 353, 105, 106, 60, 275, 72, 8, 50, 205, 185, 112, 125, 540, 65, 106, 807, 138, 96, 110, 16, 73, 33, 807, 150, 409, 400, 50, 154, 285, 96, 106, 316, 270, 205, 101, 811, 400, 8, 44, 37, 52, 40, 241, 34, 205, 38, 16, 46, 47, 85, 24, 44, 15, 64, 73, 138, 807, 85, 78, 110, 33, 420, 505, 53, 37, 38, 22, 31, 10, 110, 106, 101, 140, 15, 38, 3, 5, 44, 7, 98, 287, 135, 150, 96, 33, 84, 125, 807, 191, 96, 511, 118, 40, 370, 643, 466, 106, 41, 107, 603, 220, 275, 30, 150, 105, 49, 53, 287, 250, 208, 134, 7, 53, 12, 47, 85, 63, 138, 110, 21, 112, 140, 485, 486, 505, 14, 73, 84, 575, 1005, 150, 200, 16, 42, 5, 4, 25, 42, 8, 16, 811, 125, 160, 32, 205, 603, 807, 81, 96, 405, 41, 600, 136, 14, 20, 28, 26, 353, 302, 246, 8, 131, 160, 140, 84, 440, 42, 16, 811, 40, 67, 101, 102, 194, 138, 205, 51, 63, 241, 540, 122, 8, 10, 63, 140, 47, 48, 140, 288.</code></p>
<p>As can be seen, it consists of a series of numbers between <code>1</code> and <code>1005</code>. The encryption method used is quite simple: every number stands for a certain letter and several numbers may represent the same letter. Here’s an excerpt from the substitution table:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code class="bold">A</code><code>: 24, 27, 28, 36, 45, 81, 83 . . .</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code class="bold">B</code><code>: 9, 77, 90 . . .</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code class="bold">C</code><code>: 21, 84, 92, 94 . . .</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code class="bold">D</code><code>: 15, 52, 63 . . .</code></p>
<p>Using this excerpt, we can encrypt the plaintext string <code class="bold">ABC</code> in many different ways. For example, <code>24</code>, <code>9</code>, <code>21</code> is a valid encryption of <code class="bold">ABC</code>, as are <code>27</code>, <code>9</code>, <code>92</code> and <code>45</code>, <code>77</code>, <code>21</code>.</p>
<p>The substitution table of the second Beale cryptogram was created with one of the versions of the Declaration of Independence. <sup>1</sup>Thomas <sup>2</sup>Beale (<sup>3</sup>or <sup>4</sup>whoever <sup>5</sup>the <sup>6</sup>real <sup>7</sup>author <sup>8</sup>was) <sup>9</sup>numbered <sup>10</sup>each <sup>11</sup>word <sup>12</sup>of <sup>13</sup>it, <sup>14</sup>just <sup>15</sup>like <sup>16</sup>we <sup>17</sup>have <sup>18</sup>done <sup>19</sup>in <sup>20</sup>this <sup>21</sup>sentence. Afterward, he used each number as a potential replacement for the starting letter of the word to which it refers. For example, the message <code class="bold">WE ARE THE WORLD</code> can be encrypted to the following: <code>11 10</code>, <code>7 6 10</code>, <code>20 17 10</code>, <code>4 3 6 15 18</code>.</p>
<p>When we use the Declaration of Independence in the way we’ve described, the second Beale cryptogram decrypts to the following:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>I have deposited in the county of Bedford, about four miles from Buford’s</code><code>, in an excavation or vault, six feet below the surface of the ground, the following articles, belonging jointly to the parties whose names are given in number three, herewith:</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"> </p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>The first deposit consisted of ten hundred and fourteen pounds of gold, and thirty-eight hundred and twelve pounds of silver, deposited Nov. eighteen nineteen. The second was made Dec. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_88" title="88"/>eighteen twenty-one, and consisted of nineteen hundred and seven pounds of gold, and twelve hundred and eighty-eight of silver; also jewels, obtained in St. Louis in exchange to save transportation, and valued at thirteen thousand dollars.</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"> </p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>The above is securely packed in iron pots, with iron covers. The vault is roughly lined with stone, and the vessels rest on solid stone, and are covered with others. Paper number one describes the exact locality of the vault, so that no difficulty will be had in finding it.</code></p>
<p>Since the publication of the Beale pamphlet in 1885, countless treasure hunters have descended upon the Bedford, Virginia, area with pickaxes, shovels, and bulldozers at the ready. Many holes have been dug, but no treasure has been found. Although we believe the pamphlet was most likely a hoax, a Masonic fable, or simply a way to raise money for a failing newspaper, the story of the Beale cryptograms and their idea of unfound treasure remains one of the most famous cipher mysteries in the world.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Several ciphertext letters, numbers, or symbols that represent the same plaintext letter are called <em>homophones</em>. A cipher that substitutes letters and uses homophones is referred to as a <em>homophonic cipher</em>. The second Beale cryptogram is encrypted in a homophonic cipher. (It is also a book cipher, as will be shown in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 14"><a href="c14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a></span>.)</p>
<p>Of course, one does not need a source text such as the Declaration of Independence to create a homophonic cipher. Instead, one can simply assign several ciphertext letters to a plaintext letter and list them in a table. Here is a seventeenth-century example<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c06-endnote-2" id="c06-noteref-2">2</a></sup> in which multiple symbols could be used to encipher each letter of the alphabet in the top row:</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="126" src="image_fi/502727c06/g06002.png" width="694"/></figure>
<p>Homophonic ciphers have been used since the Middle Ages to beat frequency analysis.</p>
<p>The size of the alphabet used in a homophonic cipher may vary considerably. Some ciphers employ homophones only for the more frequent letters, as in the following eighteenth-century example:<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c06-endnote-3" id="c06-noteref-3">3</a></sup></p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="90" src="image_fi/502727c06/g06003.png" width="694"/></figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_89" title="89"/>Most homophonic ciphers use a larger alphabet than this one. In our experience, homophonic ciphers usually use fifty to one hundred ciphertext letters to encrypt the original alphabet. Each ciphertext letter consists of a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. </p>
<p>Ideally, the number of homophones assigned to a letter would be proportional to its frequency in the respective language; the more frequent letters, such as <em>E</em> and <em>T</em>, should receive more homophones than the less frequent ones, like <em>Q</em> and <em>X</em>. However, experience shows that most homophonic ciphers used in practice were not constructed in such a sophisticated way.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">To identify a homophonic cipher, it is often necessary to distinguish it from a simple substitution cipher. If there are spaces in the ciphertext, it could simply be an Aristocrat. If there are no spaces, we need to distinguish it from a Patristocrat.</p>
<p>There is one obvious difference between any simple substitution cipher and a homophonic cipher: the latter requires a larger ciphertext alphabet. If you encounter a ciphertext written in the standard alphabet or another alphabet with about twenty-six letters, you can assume that it is not a homophonic cipher (or, if nothing else, that the message will not contain very many homophones). If the alphabet contains, say, fifty letters, a homophonic cipher becomes much more likely.</p>
<p><a href="#figure6-1" id="figureanchor6-1">Figure 6-1</a> shows a message that is partially encrypted in a homophonic cipher used by Benjamin Franklin, among others.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c06-endnote-4" id="c06-noteref-4">4</a></sup> The ciphertext alphabet used here consists of numbers, the highest of which in this excerpt is 227. This means that plenty of homophones can be assigned to each character, <code class="bold">A</code> through <code class="bold">Z</code>. </p>

<p>Some homophonic ciphers we have encountered use an alphabet that consists of both ordinary and invented letters. <a href="#figure6-2" id="figureanchor6-2">Figure 6-2</a> shows an example. It’s a challenge cipher message sent to the Zodiac Killer via a newspaper advertisement in 1969.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c06-endnote-5" id="c06-noteref-5">5</a></sup> We will come back to this cryptogram in the <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_“Challenges”">“Challenges”</span> section of this chapter. An alphabet like this is ideal for a homophonic cipher with a few dozen homophones. However, it would be <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_90" title="90"/>difficult to write the second Beale cryptogram this way, as inventing hundreds of different symbols is an arduous task.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure6-2">Figure 6-2</a>: This 1969 newspaper advertisement, provided to us by Zodiac expert Dave Oranchak, shows a ciphertext that was meant to challenge the Zodiac Killer. It is encrypted in a homophonic cipher.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The matter of how to distinguish a homophonic cipher from systems other than simple substitutions remains an issue. The Vigenère cipher and many other encryption methods described in this book typically use an alphabet consisting of about twenty-six letters, which separates them from homophonic ciphers. However, a homophonic cipher can easily be confused with a <em>nomenclator</em>, which is a hybrid of codes and ciphers and consists of a collection of names (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 7 ">Chapter 7 </span>for full details on nomenclators). Differentiating between these two methods is sometimes tricky, as many nomenclators include homophones. So, in a way, a nomenclator can be regarded as a generalization of a homophonic cipher.</p>
<p>However, there is one important difference between nomenclators and homophonic ciphers: the former are encountered much more often in practice. In fact, in the course of history, the use of homophonic ciphers was much less common than the use of nomenclators. If you examine an original ciphertext (one that is not a manufactured puzzle) based on a large alphabet, the chances are extremely high that you are dealing with a nomenclator.</p>
<p>There is another way to distinguish a homophonic cipher from a nomenclator: homophonic ciphers rarely use an alphabet of more than 200 letters. The second Beale cryptogram, with its over 1,000-letter alphabet, is an exception, possibly because it is also a book cipher (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 14"><a href="c14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a></span>). If you encounter a ciphertext that contains 1,000 or more distinct numbers or letter sequences, chances are that you are dealing with a nomenclator or a code. If the alphabet is smaller, a homophonic cipher becomes more likely.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Today, the best approach to solving a homophonic cipher—like for many other encryption systems—is the computer-based, computationally intensive method of hill climbing. Several software programs support this technique; enter “homophonic solver” in a search engine to find one. These programs can break some homophonic cryptograms within seconds (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 16"><a href="c16.xhtml">Chapter 16</a></span>).</p>
<p>If you want to solve a homophonic cipher without computer support, your chances of success heavily depend on whether the spaces between the words are visible. If they aren’t, the task becomes very difficult unless you have a very long ciphertext to analyze. If, however, the word boundaries are apparent, your chances are quite good as long as there aren’t too many homophones in play. We’ll demonstrate the breaking of a homophonic cipher with the following text, which you might encounter at a geocaching event:</p>

<p>The ciphertext alphabet used here has thirty-six characters (<code>A</code>–<code>Z</code> and <code>0</code>–<code>9</code>). A plausible explanation for this is that it uses a homophonic cipher employing about ten homophones. Frequency analysis . . .</p>

<p class="BodyContinued">. . . shows that no letter makes up more than 5.4% of the ciphertext, despite the fact that several letters, especially <em>E</em>, <em>T</em>, <em>A</em>, <em>O</em>, and <em>I</em>, appear far more often in the English language. This might be because the author used homophones for the most frequent letters in order to make them harder to spot—which is exactly what a homophonic cipher is for.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_92" title="92"/>As our cryptogram contains spaces (provided that these spaces mark the boundaries between the words correctly), we can make use of the frequency distribution of each word’s initial and final letters, which is different from the frequency distribution of all letters in a text. Before we take a closer look at our geocaching cryptogram, we need some statistics about the English language in general. <a href="#figure6-3" id="figureanchor6-3">Figure 6-3</a> (a) shows the frequency distribution of an ordinary English text. Next, let’s assume that, in an ordinary English text, there are two different representations of each of the letters <em>A</em>, <em>E</em>, <em>I</em>, <em>O</em>, and <em>T</em> (i.e., homophones). We’ll call these A1 and A2, E1 and E2, I1 and I2, O1 and O2, and T1 and T2. We have chosen to focus on <em>A</em>, <em>E</em>, <em>I</em>, <em>O</em>, and <em>T</em> because they are the most frequent letters in English. If we replace each of these letters with the corresponding homophones and use the two representations of each letter roughly equally often, the frequency distribution of a typical English text will look as shown in <a href="#figure6-3">Figure 6-3</a> (b).</p>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure6-3">Figure 6-3</a>: Diagram (a) shows the letter frequencies in a typical English text, diagram (b) introduces homophones, and diagrams (c) and (d) display the same statistics for the frequencies of initial letters.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_93" title="93"/>To generate another reference statistic, let’s look solely at the initial letters of the words in a typical English text. <a href="#figure6-3">Figure 6-3</a> (c) shows initial-letter frequencies without homophones, while <a href="#figure6-3">Figure 6-3</a> (d) displays initial-letter frequencies after introducing the same A1/A2, E1/E2, and so on homophones as above.</p>
<p>Many of the differences between the overall letter frequencies with homophones (b) and initial frequencies with homophones (d) might be helpful for a codebreaker. However, for us, it is sufficient to know one specific difference: <em>T</em> is one of the most common letters in English (9%), and if we consider how often it is used as the initial letter of a word, it has an even higher frequency (14%). Because of this increase, there is a good chance that the <em>T</em> homophones have the highest initial-letter frequency in an English homophonic ciphertext. This may help us identify the plaintext <code class="bold">T</code> in a cryptogram of this kind.</p>
<p>The situation is similar if we look at the frequency of the final letters in each word of an English text. In particular, <em>I</em> is a frequent letter in English in general, but it almost never appears at the end of a word. This may help us identify the plaintext <code class="bold">I</code> in a homophonic cryptogram.</p>
<p>With this background information, let’s return to the geocaching text. We need to take a look at the frequencies of the letters in total, of the initial letters, and of the final letters of each word. We have done this using CrypTool 2, which supports initial- and final-letter counting, and we have compiled the results in <a href="#figure6-4" id="figureanchor6-4">Figure 6-4</a>. (We are not aware of a computer program that does this entire job automatically.)</p>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure6-4">Figure 6-4</a>: The bars in this diagram show the frequencies of all letters (the middle bars), as well as the initial and final letters of each word in the ciphertext we are examining.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Here are a few observations:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The ciphertext letter <code>3</code> is the most frequent initial letter. It is less common elsewhere in the text. So, <code>3</code> could be a homophone standing for <code class="bold">T</code>.</li>
<li>There must be at least one more <code class="bold">T</code> homophone (otherwise, we would expect the ciphertext letter <code>3</code> to have an initial-letter frequency of about 15%). <code>E</code> appears to be a good candidate, because, like <code>3</code>, it has a very high initial-letter frequency despite lower overall and final-letter frequencies.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_94" title="94"/>The ciphertext letters <code>H</code> and <code>S</code> each have about the same overall and initial-letter frequencies but don’t appear as the final letter of a word. They could stand for the letter <code class="bold">I</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s now proceed with a letter-pair (digraph) frequency analysis. We will only consider digraphs without spaces between the letters. Here are all the digraphs that appear more than once. We used the website <a class="LinkURL" href="http://dcode.fr/en">http://dcode.fr/en</a> for this analysis:</p>
<table border="1" class="TabularList" id="tabular-502727c06-0001">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p class="center"><b>Four appearances</b></p></td>
<td><p class="center"><b>Three appearances</b></p></td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Here are a few digraph-related facts that might be helpful:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The most frequent digraphs in the English language are <em>TH</em>, <em>HE</em>, and <em>IN</em>.</li>
<li>The most frequent reversed digraph is <em>ER</em>/<em>RE</em>. (Unfortunately, no reversed digraph appears more than once in our ciphertext.)</li>
<li>Our cryptogram contains two words that consist of only one letter: <code>B</code> (which appears twice) and <code>E</code> (which appears three times). There are only two common English one-letter words: <code class="bold">A</code> and <code class="bold">I</code>.</li>
<li>The following two-letter words appear in the ciphertext: <code>B3</code>, <code>HT</code> (which appears three times), <code>FK</code>, <code>SK</code>, <code>BU</code>, <code>S1</code>, and <code>FT</code>. Frequent English two-letter words are <code class="bold">OF</code>, <code class="bold">TO</code>, <code class="bold">IN</code>, <code class="bold">IT</code>, <code class="bold">IS</code>, <code class="bold">BE</code>, <code class="bold">AS</code>, <code class="bold">AT</code>, and <code class="bold">SO</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>How do we proceed? We know that the ciphertext letters <code>B</code> and <code>E</code> (which both appear as one-letter words) stand for either <code class="bold">A</code> or <code class="bold">I</code> (the only common one-letter words in English). We also know that the letter <code class="bold">I</code> very rarely appears as the final letter of a word. Looking at the frequency chart, we see that the ciphertext letters <code>B</code> and <code>E</code> both appear at the end of a word several times. We can therefore conclude that neither <code>B</code> nor <code>E</code> decrypts to <code class="bold">I</code>, which means that both stand for <code class="bold">A</code>.</p>
<p>What else can we find out? As we discussed, the ciphertext letter <code>3</code> is a good candidate for the plaintext <code class="bold">T</code>. If so, the fourth word in the cryptogram (<code>B3</code>) is <code class="bold">AT</code>, which makes sense. Note that we find the digraph <code>3O</code> among the most frequent ones in the ciphertext. Does <code>3O</code> stand for <code class="bold">TH</code>, which is one of the most frequent digraphs in the English language? Probably.</p>
<p>Looking at the cryptogram, we see that the word <code>3OJ</code> appears twice. If our assumption that <code>3O</code> stands for <code class="bold">TH</code> is correct, then <code>3OJ</code> must stand for <code class="bold">THE</code>, as no other common three-letter word starts with <code class="bold">TH</code>. This means <code>J</code> decrypts to <code class="bold">E</code>.</p>
<p>The ciphertext contains the word <code>3GJ</code>, which decrypts to <code class="bold">T*E</code>. It is likely that <code>G</code>, like <code>O</code>, stands for <code class="bold">H</code>.</p>
<p>Now that we know ciphertext equivalents of <code class="bold">A</code>, <code class="bold">E</code>, <code class="bold">H</code>, and <code class="bold">T</code>, we can guess others. For instance, the ciphertext word <code>MP3O</code>, which decrypts to <code class="bold">**TH</code>, might stand for <code class="bold">WITH</code>. The word <code>MP99</code> should be <code class="bold">WILL</code>. <code>MPZ9</code> probably has the same meaning, suggesting that <code>Z</code> and <code>9</code> are homophones. Now look at <code>MB9Y</code>, which must be <code class="bold">WAL*</code>. <code class="bold">WALK</code> is a good guess.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_95" title="95"/>Let’s skip the rest of this guessing exercise and provide the plaintext:</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">The Zodiac Killer was a serial killer who operated in Northern California in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He killed at least five people and severely injured two. In a series of taunting letters sent to local newspapers, he made fun of the police and announced his intent to engage in more murders and mayhem. The identity of the Zodiac Killer remains unknown. What makes this case interesting for codebreakers is that some of the killer’s letters contained encrypted messages.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c06-endnote-6" id="c06-noteref-6">6</a></sup> Altogether, four cryptograms can be attributed to the Zodiac Killer.</p>
<p>The first Zodiac Killer cryptogram, also known as Z408 because of the number of characters it contains, can be seen in <a href="#figure6-5" id="figureanchor6-5">Figure 6-5</a>. It was originally divided into three parts, each of which was sent to a different newspaper. The police consulted professional codebreakers but did not hear back quickly. With a sense of urgency, each of the newspapers published the cryptograms within a few days.</p>
<p>Donald and Bettye Harden, a puzzle-loving couple living in Salinas, California, read about Z408 in a newspaper and decided to try to decipher it. Bettye tested the assumption that the Zodiac Killer, perhaps a self-centered and pretentious person, would start the message with the plaintext word <code class="bold">I</code>, and that maybe the word <code class="bold">KILL</code> might appear in the text as well. Her guess that the first plaintext words were <code class="bold">I LIKE KILLING</code> was the breakthrough.</p>
<p>Bettye Harden soon found out that the Zodiac Killer had used a homophonic cipher to encrypt this message. Here’s the (rather gruesome) plaintext, spelling errors and all:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>I LIKE KILLING PEOPLE BECAUSE IT IS SO MUCH FUN IT IS MORE FUN THAN KILLING WILD GAME IN THE FORREST BECAUSE MAN IS THE MOST DANGEROUE ANAMAL OF ALL TO KILL SOMETHING GIVES ME THE MOST THRILLING EXPERENCE IT IS EVEN BETTER THAN GETTING YOUR ROCKS OFF WITH A GIRL THE BEST PART OF IT IS THAE WHEN I DIE I WILL BE REBORN IN PARADICE AND ALL THEI HAVE KILLED WILL BECOME MY SLAVES I WILL NOT GIVE YOU MY NAME BECAUSE YOU WILL TRY TO SLOI DOWN OR ATOP MY COLLECTIOG OF SLAVES FOR MY AFTERLIFE.

<p class="BodyFirst"><a href="#figure6-6" id="figureanchor6-6">Figure 6-6</a> shows the second of the Zodiac Killer’s four messages, which had been sent to local newspapers. It was mailed on November 8, 1969. This cryptogram consists of 340 characters and is therefore referred to as Z340. Contrary to the aforementioned Z408, it wasn’t solved right away. Over the decades, Z340, which is long enough to allow for meaningful frequency analysis and other statistical examinations, became one of the most famous unsolved crypto mysteries in the world. In the first edition of this book, released on December 10, 2020, Z340 was even listed in the <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_“Unsolved cryptograms”">“Unsolved cryptograms”</span> section of this chapter.</p>

</figure>
<p>However, on December 11, 2020, only one day after publication of the first edition, we received a message from our friend, Zodiac Killer expert Dave Oranchak. What he wrote was hard to believe: he claimed that Z340 had been solved! According to his message, this success had been achieved by a team of three experts consisting of Dave himself, Belgian codebreaking specialist Jarl Van Eycke, and Australian mathematician Sam Blake (<a href="#figure6-7" id="figureanchor6-7">Figure 6-7</a>).</p>

</figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_98" title="98"/>Of course, we were skeptical, as many bogus decipherments of this famous ciphertext had been published before. However, a video Dave published about the solution that he and his colleagues had found appeared to make sense.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c06-endnote-7" id="c06-noteref-7">7</a></sup> Several cipher experts mentioned in our own book, including Nils Kopal,<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c06-endnote-8" id="c06-noteref-8">8</a></sup> Nick Pelling,<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c06-endnote-9" id="c06-noteref-9">9</a></sup> Joachim von zur Gathen,<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c06-endnote-10" id="c06-noteref-10">10</a></sup> and George Lasry (via email), confirmed the correctness of Dave, Jarl, and Sam’s decipherment. To really clinch things, the FBI published an official statement via Twitter, saying, “A cipher attributed to the Zodiac Killer was recently solved by private citizens.”<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c06-endnote-11" id="c06-noteref-11">11</a></sup> There could be no doubt: Z340 had been broken!</p>
<p> Dave and Jarl had originally connected in 2014, which led to Jarl’s creation of the AZDecrypt software in 2015 to break homophonic ciphers. Then Dave and Sam connected in 2019 through Dave’s YouTube channel, <em>Let’s Crack Zodiac</em>. They jointly examined Z340 for months, suspecting that the Zodiac Killer had used a combination of two ciphers: a homophonic substitution similar to the one employed for Z408, and a transposition cipher (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 9"><a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a></span>).<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c06-endnote-12" id="c06-noteref-12">12</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c06-endnote-13" id="c06-noteref-13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>As there is a mind-boggling quantity of possible transpositions that could be applied to a text of this length—in fact, the options are seemingly infinite—the three codebreakers had to limit their examinations to the most likely ones. So, they assumed that the message had been split up in a simple way—horizontally, vertically, or both. Among other possibilities, they considered the following:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>It might have been split into one horizontal section with two vertical sections.</li>
<li>It might have been split into two horizontal sections with three vertical sections.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2015, Jarl and an anonymous forum user nicknamed “daikon” had already discovered that the digraph frequencies of Z340 had some interesting statistical properties when every nineteenth symbol was read. This suggested that leaping through the ciphertext in steps of nineteen was a part of the process that led to the plaintext.</p>
<p>Even within these constraints, sifting through all the substitution and transposition candidates still meant searching for a needle in a gigantic haystack. Dave, Jarl, and Sam tested no fewer than 650,000 transposition variants. When at first they didn’t find anything close to a solution to Z340, they decided to shift their focus to re-examining the top 10% of the candidate transpositions, as scored by AZDecrypt. This time, they also gave the software more time to search.</p>
<p>The breakthrough came on December 3, 2020, when, in one of the numerous deciphering attempts, the expressions <code class="bold">HOPE YOU ARE, TRYING TO CATCH ME</code> and <code class="bold">THE GAS CHAMBER</code> appeared. When Dave configured these text fragments as cribs, AZDecrypt suddenly produced meaningful sentences.</p>
<p>An even more exciting development was that this plaintext candidate contained the phrase <code class="bold">THAT WASNT ME ON THE TV SHOW</code>, which Dave immediately recognized as an allusion to a man who had called in to a TV show pretending to be the perpetrator two weeks before the encrypted message <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_99" title="99"/>was sent in 1969. This strongly implied that they had the solution to the first nine lines of the ciphertext!</p>
<p>However, applying that technique to the rest of the message still didn’t result in a meaningful plaintext. The team needed two further breakthroughs to bring the whole plaintext into view. First, Dave discovered that in the last two lines, a few words were written backward, with no other transposition being used. Second, Jarl figured out a few mistakes or disrupted transpositions in the second section. Now, the successful codebreakers could finally determine the following plaintext (a few errors are corrected):</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>I HOPE YOU ARE HAVING LOTS OF FUN IN TRYING TO CATCH ME  THAT WASNT ME ON THE TV SHOW  WHICH BRINGS UP A POINT ABOUT ME  I AM NOT AFRAID OF THE GAS CHAMBER BECAUSE IT WILL SEND ME TO PARADICE ALL THE SOONER BECAUSE I NOW HAVE ENOUGH SLAVES TO WORK FOR ME WHERE EVERYONE ELSE HAS NOTHING WHEN THEY REACH PARADICE SO THEY ARE AFRAID OF DEATH  I AM NOT AFRAID BECAUSE I KNOW THAT MY NEW LIFE IS DEATH LIFE WILL BE AN EASY ONE IN PARADICE</code></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the plaintext does not contain any information that directly suggests the identity of the Zodiac Killer. During the deciphering process, it became clear that the message was divided into three sections. This means that the codebreakers’ hypothesis that the text was split up in a simple way proved correct. This is the kind of lucky guesswork one needs to break a difficult cipher! </p>
<p><a href="#figure6-8" id="figureanchor6-8">Figure 6-8</a> shows the homophonic cipher table the Zodiac Killer used. As one would expect, the number of homophones available for each letter is roughly proportional to the letter’s frequency. <em>E</em> and <em>T</em>, the most common letters in the English language, can be mapped to six different symbols, respectively.</p>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure6-8">Figure 6-8</a>: The substitution table used for Z340 represents a homophonic cipher. </p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The transposition cipher that Z340 is based on is explained in <a href="#figure6-9" id="figureanchor6-9">Figure 6-9</a>. As can be seen, the message needs to be divided into two large sections (of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_100" title="100"/>nine lines each) and one small section (of two lines). To decrypt the two large sections, one starts in each section’s upper-left-hand corner and works through the message with knight moves (two steps to the right, one step down). Once the right-hand edge of the section is reached, one repeats the pattern, starting with the second symbol in the first row. When all symbols in the upper-right-hand half of the block have been visited, the path continues in the lower-left-hand one. Note that in many cases, a leap of symbols (e.g., from the first symbol in the first line to the third symbol in the second line) is necessary, as suggested by “daikon” and Jarl.</p>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure6-9">Figure 6-9</a>: The transposition the Zodiac Killer used for the upper two blocks of Z340 is mainly based on knight moves (two steps to the right, one step down).</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the third section, no knight moves are used. Instead, the message is written from left to right and top to bottom, with some words written backward. It seems possible that, in addition, the expressions <code class="bold">LIFE IS</code>, <code class="bold">LIFE WILL</code>, and <code class="bold">DEATH </code>need to be shifted elsewhere. To date, several possible suggestions have been made.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c06-endnote-14" id="c06-noteref-14">14</a></sup> </p>
<p>Did the Zodiac Killer want Z340 to be deciphered? The phrase <code class="bold">THAT WASN’T ME ON THE TV SHOW</code> suggests that he did because it contains information he probably wanted to be known relatively quickly. This leads to the question of whether the killer underestimated the difficulty of his cipher. Could we extrapolate that he had never tried to solve such a system? What types of ciphers had he tried to solve in the past that would lead him to think this cipher was solvable with the technology of the time?</p>
<p>It goes without saying that Dave, Jarl, and Sam did a tremendous job in combing through countless potential substitution tables and transposition patterns to identify the correct one. In our opinion, this proved to be one of the greatest nonmilitary codebreaking successes in generations!</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Ferdinand III (1608–57), a Holy Roman emperor from the House of Habsburg, played an important role in the Thirty Years’ War, one of the most devastating wars in Europe. When researching his life, historians such as Leopold Auer from Vienna repeatedly encountered encrypted letters. The system Ferdinand III used was based on numbers and simple geometric symbols arranged in pairs. As can be seen in <a href="#figure6-10" id="figureanchor6-10">Figure 6-10</a>, Ferdinand’s letters were a mixture of encrypted and cleartext passages, but they remained unsolved by historians.</p>

<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_102" title="102"/>Thomas Ernst, a German scientist who teaches in the United States, tried his luck on this mystery.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c06-endnote-15" id="c06-noteref-15">15</a></sup> Ernst had already made a name for himself in the 1990s when he deciphered the third book of the <em>Steganographia</em> by Johannes Trithemius (1462–1516) (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 15"><a href="c15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a></span>). </p>
<p>Parts of Ferdinand’s letter had already been transcribed: a mixture of the cleartext letters and words, combined with encrypted portions that were a jumble of numbers and symbols.</p>
<p>As a scholar of languages and a historian, Ernst could easily read the emperor’s cleartext passages, which were a mixture of seventeenth-century German and Latin. On the remaining portions, Ernst tested several hypotheses. His central discovery was that each geometric symbol represented the number of lines or semicircles it consisted of. For example, a square, with its four sides, stood for the number <code>4</code>, a triangle for the number <code>3</code>, and so forth. Using these numbers, Ernst constructed the following transcript:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>1640, 20 July /</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>Zifra 21 13 42 04 23 14 33 13 / 43 02 01</code></p>

<p>The second breakthrough occurred when he realized that the Habsburg motto “AEIOU” played a role in the cipher. One interpretation of the motto is “Austria erit in orbe ultima,” which translates to “Austria will exist until the end of the world.” From the “AEIOU” motto, Ernst derived the following mappings in Ferdinand’s cipher:</p>

<p>When he looked at the sequence <code>21 13 42 04 23 04 33 03 43 02 01</code> at the beginning of the letter, he identified the following vowels: <code class="bold">I – O – O – I – E A</code>, where the dashes stood for missing consonants. The vowel pattern suggested an adjective that could only be <code class="bold">PICOLOMINEA</code>. Octavio Piccolomini, along with the emperor’s brother Leopold Wilhelm, was the chief commander of the imperial army at the time. <code class="bold">PICOLOMINEA</code> was encrypted <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_103" title="103"/>without the double <code class="bold">C</code>. <code class="bold">Zifra PICCOLOMINEA</code> meant an enciphered letter with Piccolomini as the name of the cipher.</p>
<p>Next, Ernst guessed that the missing word in <code class="bold">fuit </code><code>43 04 34 41 24 00 </code><code class="bold">ruina</code> was <code class="bold">NOSTRA</code> (Latin for <code class="bold">OUR</code>).

<p class="BodyFirst">The cryptogram shown in <a href="#figure6-11" id="figureanchor6-11">Figure 6-11</a> was written on a postcard sent from Hawaii in 1886.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c06-endnote-16" id="c06-noteref-16">16</a></sup> It was provided to us by the National Cryptologic Museum in Maryland and solved by our colleague Armin Krauß, a very skilled German codebreaker. Armin knew that most encrypted postcards are encoded in simple substitution ciphers—but usually ones that include spaces, which is not the case here. That means this is a Patristocrat cipher, not Aristocrat. So, Armin suspected that one of the symbols represented the space character. After some analysis, Armin realized that there were, in fact, two symbols representing spaces (i.e., homophones): <code>T</code> and its upside-down version. Next, he identified that the one-letter word that appeared four times in the text was <code class="bold">I</code>.</p>
<p>Armin then tried to identify <code class="bold">E</code>, the most frequent letter in the English language. However, none of the symbols appeared as frequently as one would expect if they stood for <code class="bold">E</code>, so he made another guess: perhaps two symbols stood for <code class="bold">E</code>. This hypothesis proved correct. Based on frequency analysis and some guessing, Armin saw that both <code>X</code> and the symbol that consists of three parallel horizontal lines stood for <code class="bold">E</code>. The rest of the decryption was routine. Here is the plaintext Armin recovered:</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Earlier in this chapter, we introduced a Zodiac-style cipher message (see <a href="#figure6-2">Figure 6-2</a>) published by the police in California newspaper advertisements around the time of the Zodiac murders in the late 1960s. The message is encrypted with a simple homophonic cipher, and the plaintext contains a telephone number. Police hoped that the killer would succeed in deciphering the message and then call the number to demonstrate his superiority. The plan failed, but at least the cryptogram makes a nice cipher challenge. Can you solve it?</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">American author Edgar Allan Poe had a long fascination with cryptology. His 1843 short story “The Gold-Bug” is the most famous work of fiction that describes codebreaking. (The system broken in the story is a simple substitution cipher.) A few years earlier, in 1839, when Poe wrote for <em>Alexander’s Weekly Messenger</em>, he initiated a cryptography contest that challenged his readers to send him ciphertexts to break.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c06-endnote-17" id="c06-noteref-17">17</a></sup> As a result, his readers sent him simple substitution ciphertexts, which, as we know now, are fairly simple to solve. He made a similar call in 1841 in <em>Graham’s Magazine</em>, for which he received about a hundred cryptograms that he allegedly solved. To conclude the <em>Messenger</em> contest around 1840, he published two ciphertexts (supposedly submitted by a W.B. Tyler) that remained unsolved for over 150 years.</p>
<p>In 1985, Louis Renza, professor of English at Dartmouth College, proposed that this W.B. Tyler had never existed and that Poe had created the messages himself. Renza’s writings brought the two challenge ciphertexts to new public attention, and in the 1990s, the first of these messages was solved independently by Terence Whalen and John Hodgson (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 9"><a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a></span>).</p>
<p>The second ciphertext is depicted in <a href="#figure6-12" id="figureanchor6-12">Figure 6-12</a>. In 2000, Canadian software engineer Gil Broza found the correct decryption, and it turned out that a homophonic cipher had been used.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c06-endnote-18" id="c06-noteref-18">18</a></sup> As you can guess from the fact that it took 160 years for the ciphertext to be solved, this cryptogram is not necessarily a beginner’s challenge!</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">As discussed earlier in this chapter, a nineteenth-century Virginian adventurer named Thomas Beale allegedly described a treasure and its location in three encrypted notes. This story is likely mere fiction, but the encrypted notes are worth studying. While the second message has been broken, the two other cryptograms have yet to be deciphered. Beale Paper #1 reportedly contains the location of the treasure, while #3 contains the names and residences of Beale’s associates and their families.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">In 1882, a man named Henry Debosnys (1836–1883) settled in Essex County, New York.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c06-endnote-22" id="c06-noteref-22">22</a></sup> He soon started courting a widow named Elizabeth Wells, and after only a few weeks, the two married. A few months later, Elizabeth was found murdered, and Debosnys was arrested as the alleged perpetrator. It became clear that two earlier wives of Debosnys had also died at a young age under similarly strange circumstances. While in prison, Debosnys, who was a knowledgeable and well-educated man, created drawings, wrote poems, and also authored a few texts that appear to be encrypted (see <a href="#figure6-14" id="figureanchor6-14">Figure 6-14</a>). In 1883, he was condemned to death and subsequently hanged. The Adirondack History Museum in Elizabethtown, New York, has many interesting exhibits about the execution, as well as the actual ciphers created by Debosnys.</p>
<p>The story of Henry Debosnys has been best documented by Cheri Farnsworth in her 2010 book <em>Adirondack Enigma</em>.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c06-endnote-23" id="c06-noteref-23">23</a></sup> There are many open questions about this case, including more reliable information about the deaths of his two earlier wives. </p>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure6-14">Figure 6-14</a>: The cryptograms of condemned wife-murderer Henry Debosnys have never been solved.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The four known cryptograms Debosnys left behind might shed light on these questions, but they have never been deciphered. Debosnys, an accomplished artist, used a large set of pictogram-style symbols to encode his messages, which suggests the application of a homophonic cipher. Although the Debosnys cryptograms are a spectacular crypto mystery, they have not received much attention in the international codebreaking community so far. Perhaps you, dear reader, might be able to solve them!</p>

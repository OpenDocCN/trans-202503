<h2 class="h2b"><strong>IF YOU READ ONLY ONE CHAPTER, MAKE IT THIS ONE</strong></h2>
<p class="noindentt1"><span class="small">IF YOU CAME ACROSS THIS BOOK</span> and had time to read only one chapter, this would be the one for you. Why? Because it shows you the fastest way for you to improve your designs.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec1"><strong>How it works is more important than how it looks</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">I know you probably came to this book looking for help with how to improve the look of your designs, but stick with me for a moment: the way your design <em>works</em> is more important than how it <em>looks</em>.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Take Craigslist, for example. The website largely hasn’t changed over the years, and the design appears very dated (<strong><a class="ash1" href="ch01.xhtml#ch1fig1">FIGURE 1-1</a></strong>).</p>
<p class="noindentt1">If how it looked were most important, Craigslist would have lost out years ago to any of the other shiny new classified ad websites that have popped up.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Craigslist has continued to be the top destination for classified ads simply because it’s so simple and straightforward to use. <a id="page_2"/>With no flashy effects or distracting banners, Craigslist makes it super simple to post ads and search existing ads.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch1fig1"><img alt="image" src="../images/01fig01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 1-1:</strong> Craigslist is still the top of its class without a modern-looking website design.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">If you’re fretting that your website is too simple and doesn’t look “modern” — that is, doesn’t adhere to all the latest trends, which don’t necessarily dictate “good” website design — I’m here to reassure you that looks matter far less than whether your design succeeds in what you and your users want it to achieve.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">There are two important steps for ensuring that your design results in a good user experience: knowing what you want your design to accomplish and getting feedback from others.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec2"><em>Determine what success looks like</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">You can’t track how well your design is doing its job until you know your design’s goal. Different kinds of designs have different goals. For example, you might want visitors to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="noindent5">Fill out a form.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5">Spend an average of at least 30 seconds viewing a page.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><a id="page_3"/>Subscribe to a newsletter.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5">Leave a comment.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindentt1">You might have heard the term <em>conversion rates</em> in user experience books, which is a fancy way of asking, “What percentage of people are doing what I want them to do?” Once you’ve defined what “success” looks like for your website, you can make better decisions about your design, measure how well your current design works, and improve your conversion rate.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec3"><em>Ask other people to view and review your designs</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">If you’re feeling bashful about your newfound design skills, you might not want to show your designs to anyone else. What if they don’t like them? What if they say something negative?</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Getting over these feelings of insecurity and getting your designs in front of people who aren’t you will lead to the <em>biggest</em> improvements in your designs. As a designer, you cannot objectively evaluate how well your designs work. You become blind to potential problems.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">By showing your designs to others, you’ll be able to see whether people successfully achieve what you want them to, and whether anything about the site is confusing. And you may get some high fives as well.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Feedback is useful, but don’t feel you need to follow every suggestion or address every comment you receive. File them away in your mind, or keep a list, and then take care of all of those changes once you’ve heard from several people. Sometimes you’ll get contradictory feedback from two different people, and that’s fine (if one of them more closely fits the profile of your target user, that person’s feedback is more important!). Maybe there’s a third approach that could make everyone happy, or maybe it’s not worth worrying about that piece yet.</p>

<p class="noindentt1">“But Tracy,” you might be saying, “I really want to make my design <em>look</em> better too, not just work better.”</p>
<p class="noindentt1">I hear you! The way your design looks also affects user experience, and you can improve your design by keeping one key concept (which applies to many things) in mind: <em>cut down on clutter.</em></p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec5"><em>Cut down on clutter for better looking designs</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">Clutter — such as you see in busy, disorganized, and chaotic designs — is the bane of good user experience, and cleaning up your clutter creates websites that both <em>look</em> better and <em>work</em> better.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Expanding on this concept, here are some short, easy-to-understand principles that we’ll cover in more depth later:</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev1sec6">USE A GRID</h5>
<p class="noindentt1">Most designs cut down on clutter by using a grid, which creates a skeleton for your design to anchor objects and create an unconscious feeling of order. Small pixel differences can make a design feel sloppy and unprofessional.</p>
<p class="content"><em>We’ll cover this topic in more depth in <a class="ash" href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <a class="ash" href="ch02.xhtml#ch00lev1sec11">Section 2.1</a>.</em></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev1sec7">CHOOSE JUST A FEW COLORS</h5>
<p class="noindentt1">Designs that are chock-full of different colors (24 shades of blue, 5 shades of red, and so on) look busy. Set a specific color palette and use only those colors in your design to create a much more cohesive look.</p>
<p class="content"><em>We’ll cover this topic in more depth in <a class="ash" href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <a class="ash" href="ch02.xhtml#ch00lev1sec17">Section 2.2</a>.</em></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev1sec8"><a id="page_5"/>LIMIT YOURSELF TO TWO DIFFERENT TYPEFACES</h5>
<p class="noindentt1">While you <em>can</em> use one typeface for your navigation, another for your text, another for your buttons, and another for your headlines — this will make your designs feel chaotic. Restrict the number of typefaces you use, and use bolding, italics, all caps, and other transforms to create variety and indicate emphasis.</p>
<p class="content"><em>We’ll cover this topic in more depth in <a class="ash" href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <a class="ash" href="ch02.xhtml#ch00lev1sec25">Section 2.3</a>.</em></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev1sec9">SIMPLIFY YOUR TEXT</h5>
<p class="noindentt1">Large blocks of text come across as clutter. Simplify your sentences and limit paragraphs to two to three sentences. You can also break text up by adding bullets and headlines. Readers on the web tend to skim text, and shorter paragraphs keep more readers reading.</p>
<p class="content"><em>We’ll cover this topic in more depth in <a class="ash" href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a>, <a class="ash" href="ch02.xhtml#ch00lev1sec58">Section 2.6</a>.</em></p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev1sec10">ADD WHITE SPACE</h5>
<p class="noindentt1">White space is the ultimate clutter reducer. One of the biggest mistakes new designers make is pushing items much too close to each other. Adding space between elements (content, widgets, forms, buttons, images, text, and so on) makes designs easier to read and more modern, airy, and inviting.</p>

<p class="noindentt1">All of the above can be distilled into one sentence:</p>
<p class="content_c"><span class="blue"><strong>Make sure your design <em>works</em> well,<br/>and reduce as much clutter as possible.</strong></span></p>

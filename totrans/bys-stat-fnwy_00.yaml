- en: Virtually everything in life is, to some extent, uncertain. This may seem like
    a bit of an exaggeration, but to see the truth of it you can try a quick experiment.
    At the start of the day, write down something you think will happen in the next
    half-hour, hour, three hours, and six hours. Then see how many of these things
    happen exactly like you imagined. You’ll quickly realize that your day is full
    of uncertainties. Even something as predictable as “I will brush my teeth” or
    “I’ll have a cup of coffee” may not, for some reason or another, happen as you
    expect.

    our day. For example, even though traffic might make your morning commute longer
    than usual, you can make a pretty good estimate about what time you need to leave
    home in order to get to work on time. If you have a super-important morning meeting,
    you might leave earlier to allow for delays. We all have an innate sense of how
    to deal with uncertain situations and reason about uncertainty. When you think
    this way, you’re starting to think *probabilistically*.

- en: The subject of this book, Bayesian statistics, helps us get better at reasoning
    about uncertainty, just as studying logic in school helps us to see the errors
    in everyday logical thinking. Given that virtually everyone deals with uncertainty
    in their daily life, as we just discussed, this makes the audience for this book
    pretty wide. Data scientists and researchers already using statistics will benefit
    from a deeper understanding and intuition for how these tools work. Engineers
    and programmers will learn a lot about how they can better quantify decisions
    they have to make (I’ve even used Bayesian analysis to identify causes of software
    bugs!). Marketers and salespeople can apply the ideas in this book when running
    A/B tests, trying to understand their audience, and better assessing the value
    of opportunities. Anyone making high-level decisions should have at least a basic
    sense of probability so they can make quick back-of-the-envelope estimates about
    the costs and benefits of uncertain decisions. I wanted this book to be something
    a CEO could study on a flight and develop a solid enough foundation by the time
    they land to better assess choices that involve probabilities and uncertainty.

    a Bayesian way. With Bayesian statistics, you can use mathematics to model that
    uncertainty so you can make better choices given limited information. For example,
    suppose you need to be on time for work for a particularly important meeting and
    there are two different routes you could take. The first route is usually faster,
    but has pretty regular traffic back-ups that can cause huge delays. The second
    route takes longer in general but is less prone to traffic. Which route should
    you take? What type of information would you need to decide this? And how certain
    can you be in your choice? Even just a small amount of added complexity requires
    some extra thought and technique.

    on a new drug, economists following trends in the market, analysts predicting
    the next election, baseball managers trying to build the best team with fancy
    math, and so on. While all of these are certainly fascinating uses of statistics,
    understanding the basics of Bayesian reasoning can help you in far more areas
    in everyday life. If you’ve ever questioned some new finding reported in the news,
    stayed up late browsing the web wondering if you have a rare disease, or argued
    with a relative over their irrational beliefs about the world, learning Bayesian
    statistics will help you reason better.

- en: You may be wondering what all this “Bayesian” stuff is. If you’ve ever taken
    a statistics class, it was likely based on *frequentist statistics*. Frequentist
    statistics is founded on the idea that probability represents the frequency with
    which something happens. If the probability of getting heads in a single coin
    toss is 0.5, that means after a single coin toss we can expect to get one-half
    of a head of a coin (with two tosses we can expect to get one head, which makes
    more sense).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bayesian statistics, on the other hand, is concerned with how probabilities
    represent how uncertain we are about a piece of information. In Bayesian terms,
    if the probability of getting heads in a coin toss is 0.5, that means we are equally
    unsure about whether we’ll get heads or tails. For problems like coin tosses,
    both frequentist and Bayesian approaches seem reasonable, but when you’re quantifying
    your belief that your favorite candidate will win the next election, the Bayesian
    interpretation makes much more sense. After all, there’s only one election, so
    speaking about how frequently your favorite candidate will win doesn’t make much
    sense. When doing Bayesian statistics, we’re just trying to accurately describe
    what we believe about the world given the information we have.
  prefs: []

- en: One particularly nice thing about Bayesian statistics is that, because we can
    view it simply as reasoning about uncertain things, all of the tools and techniques
    of Bayesian statistics make intuitive sense.

- en: Bayesian statistics is about looking at a problem you face, figuring out how
    you want to describe it mathematically, and then using reason to solve it. There
    are no mysterious tests that give results that you aren’t quite sure of, no distributions
    you have to memorize, and no traditional experiment designs you must perfectly
    replicate. Whether you want to figure out the probability that a new web page
    design will bring you more customers, if your favorite sports team will win the
    next game, or if we really are alone in the universe, Bayesian statistics will
    allow you to start reasoning about these things mathematically using just a few
    simple rules and a new way of looking at problems.

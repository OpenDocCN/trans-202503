<p>My family and friends for supporting me in all my endeavors.</p>
<p>Kevin Villanueva for volunteering me to lead the API penetration testing efforts at Moss Adams in 2019. Troy Hawes, Francis Tam, and everyone else on the Moss Adams Cybersecurity team for challenging, helping, and provoking me to be better.</p>
<p>Gary Lamb, Eric Wilson, and Scott Gnile for being a such great mentors in my career.</p>

<p>Alex Rifman for providing top-notch technical editing and jumping into the project at a speed that would have impressed Barry Allen.</p>
<p>Inon Shkedy for his support throughout the writing of this book and providing me with beta access to crAPI. Additional thanks to the rest of the OWASP API Security Top 10 project team, Erez Yalon and Paulo Silva.</p>

<p>Dolev Farhi for Damn GraphQL, his excellent conference talks, and all his help with the GraphQL sections of this book. </p>

<p>Sean Yeoh and the rest of the great team at Assetnote for their API hacking content and tools.</p>

<p>And, of course, the excellent team at No Starch Press, including Bill Pollock, Athabasca Witschi, and Frances Saux for taking the ramblings of an API hacking madman and turning them into this book. Bill, thanks for taking a chance on me at a time when the world was filled with so many uncertainties. I am grateful.</p>

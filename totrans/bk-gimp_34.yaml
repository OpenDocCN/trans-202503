    often. Much of this information is also found in this book and in the GIMP documentation,
    but this appendix provides a quick reference.

- en: Some common questions are not covered because the problems that led to those
    questions have been solved in the latest version of GIMP. For example, you can
    no longer lose your layers, paths, channels, selections, guides, layer masks,
    and so on when saving an image because you can no longer save it in any other
    format than XCF, which saves all these image components. You are no longer forbidden
    to export an image to GIF format, even if it is not in indexed representation,
    because the transformation will be automatically (and silently) done. You can
    now add a layer mask to a layer even if it has no Alpha channel. Wrapping text
    is easy, too, thanks to the Fixed Box option for the new and improved Text tool.

- en: Other frequently asked questions dealt with missing features, and many of those
    features have been added to GIMP 2.8 (they are mentioned in the Introduction).
    Of course, some users will find that the features they’ve been waiting for haven’t
    yet been added, and they’ll have to wait for GIMP 3.0\. Some of the commonly requested
    features that have not yet been added are covered in the following answers to
    questions.

    will replace the five existing transform tools (Scale, Rotate, Shear, Flip, and
    Perspective); an interactive deform tool similar to the IWarp filter and included

    allow users to work with several styluses and customize them for a given painting

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    with any painting tool. After choosing the drawing tool and setting the parameters,
    click the first point of the line and then press the ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1453922.png.jpg)
    key and place the endpoint. You can even draw a polygon in this way, by pressing

    it to a path and stroke it.

    a larger image with proportionate fonts and then scaling it to the proper size
    is a better idea. Either way, always check the ANTIALIAS checkbox in the Text
    tool options and choose anything other than NONE for HINTING.

    example.

    printing definition to change the printed size, or you can change the final size
    of the print, which changes the definition. In any case, the printing size is
    generally very different from the viewing size on a screen.

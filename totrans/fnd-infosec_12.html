<div class="imagel"><img alt="Image" src="../images/common.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">So far, I’ve assumed that you’ll be protecting information contained on traditional desktop or laptop computers. However, you’ll also find vulnerable devices in your pockets, heating and air conditioning systems, security systems, hospital rooms, cars, and a dizzying array of other places. That’s why your security program should include mobile devices, Internet of Things devices, and embedded devices. Internet of Things devices, such as cameras or medical devices, are any internet-connected devices that don’t run a full desktop operating system. Embedded devices are computers that run inside some other device, such as the controller in a car. These technologies are often small and go unnoticed, but they densely litter our world.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In many cases, people overlook security concerns related to these devices because the devices are either ubiquitous, such as smartphones, or rarely thought about, such as medical devices. However, when they’re compromised, the consequences can range from embarrassing to fatal. If <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_160"/>attackers compromise these systems, they could steal our photo libraries, cause rolling power outages that black out half the country, or increase the dosage on our insulin pumps to issue a fatal dose.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Each of the areas I’ll discuss in this chapter has its own specific security issues, some of which resemble those discussed in other chapters and some of which are entirely unique.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch12lev1sec1">Mobile Security</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">As mobile devices become more prevalent, they also grow increasingly vulnerable to security issues. These devices have powerful hardware resources and capabilities, and they’re generally connected to some kind of network at all times. They move in and out of environments with regularity and store and transmit data without notice—and don’t necessarily comply with the basic security measures considered normal on standard, nonmobile computers.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Mobile devices include smartphones and tablets most likely running iOS or Android operating systems, as well as a variety of head-mounted devices and smartwatches. People use mobile devices to send and receive email, surf the web, edit documents, play videos or games, and listen to music—in short, most of the same functions as nonmobile computers.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The line between mobile devices and computers has become considerably blurred. On the one hand, some of our smartphones rival the processing power and storage capacity of computers and have similarly capable operating systems. On the other hand, some computers, like small ultrabooks and devices such as the Raspberry Pi, run on minimal hardware and use little power. Some even run mobile operating systems, such as Android. Since distinguishing between these devices becomes a question of design philosophy rather than physical capability, we should treat them the same from a security perspective.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch12lev2sec1"><em>Protecting Mobile Devices</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">That said, people protect mobile devices in a few specific ways. Usually, businesses will use both software and some sort of policy to maintain mobile device security.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Mobile Device Management</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Many devices used in organizational environments have well-established sets of tools and features allowing you to centrally manage them. Being <em>centrally managed</em> means that these devices are under the control of one main system that maintains them. Central management lets you automatically patch vulnerabilities and upgrade software, force users to change their passwords at regular intervals, regulate and track installed software, and adjust a device’s settings to a standard dictated by a particular policy.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_161"/>For mobile devices, you can generally accomplish these tasks through an external management solution, a category referred to as <em>mobile device management</em>, enterprise mobility management, or unified endpoint management, depending on slight differences in features and vendors’ preferences. Over time, these solutions have expanded to include desktop and server operating systems.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The exact architecture of a management solution will vary from one vendor to another, but most use an agent (a piece of software) on the mobile device to enforce a certain configuration on the device. These agents typically regulate access to a business’s resources, such as email, calendaring, or network resources, and can discontinue a client’s access if it becomes noncompliant, if the device is stolen, or if the user’s employment is terminated. Additionally, many management solutions let you remotely wipe a device, either completely or just corporate data, or disable it entirely.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As the distinction between mobile and nonmobile devices becomes narrower, vendors of management solutions have begun to support some traditionally nonmobile devices, allowing you to remotely manage both mobile and nonmobile devices using the same tools and techniques.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Deployment Models</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Most organizations have a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy regulating the use of personal and corporate devices in the workplace. The policy might allow only corporate-owned devices to interact with enterprise resources, personal devices only, or something in between.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Allowing only corporate-owned mobile devices can make it easier for the organization to centrally manage them. Using a mobile device management solution, you might ban the use of personal email and file-sharing apps, for instance, and disable a user’s ability to install non-business-related apps. You can also force users to install updates or security patches and change their password regularly, leading to a more secure mobile environment. We typically call corporate-owned mobile devices either <em>corporate-owned business only (COBO)</em> or <em>corporate-owned personally enabled (COPE)</em>, depending on whether you can use them for personal reasons or not.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If, on the other hand, you allow personal devices only and don’t manage them with mobile device management, you won’t have many of these capabilities. Certain tools also provide some additional security functionality, such as allowing you to delete data remotely without actively monitoring them, but a savvy technical user may be able to subvert such measures. While a small organization with minimal resources might use this method to administer a complex mobile infrastructure, this probably wouldn’t be optimal for a large enterprise.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Many organizations allow a mix of personal and corporate-owned devices and sometimes restrict some of the personal devices’ capabilities. You could allow the more secure and trusted devices access to a greater set of resources, while still letting people access basic services, such as email, on their personal devices, providing they agree to have these devices managed by a management tool and accept a reasonable set of security features.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch12lev2sec2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_162"/><em>Mobile Security Issues</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Mobile devices face several specific security issues. While this section is by no means exhaustive, it outlines some of the more common areas of risk.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">The Baseband Operating System</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Every modern mobile device contains an operating system underneath the one you can see, called the <em>baseband operating system</em>. This tiny operating system runs on its own processor and generally handles the phone’s hardware, like radios, universal serial bus (USB) ports, and global positioning system (GPS). The type of baseband operating system varies based on the processor it runs on, and the operating systems are generally proprietary to the manufacturer of the device. This lack of standardization, coupled with infrequent device updates (I’ll return to this momentarily), can cause vulnerabilities that last for years, often for the life of the device.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Given that the baseband operating systems work outside the view of the device’s “normal” operating system, attackers can use them to carry out a variety of attacks. For example, in October 2018, attackers spied on US President Trump’s cell phones via the Signaling System No. 7 (SS7) protocol<a href="notes.xhtml#ch12fn1" id="kch12fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> used by the baseband operating system and cell phone carriers for routing calls and text messages, among other things. The SS7 protocol was developed in 1975, in an era where security was not a design goal.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Unfortunately, short of an update from the device manufacturers, you can’t do much to directly fix these vulnerabilities other than putting additional controls in place to compensate for them, such as additional encryption or application segmentation on the device.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Jailbreaking</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><em>Jailbreaking</em>, or rooting, a mobile device means modifying it to remove restrictions that the device manufacturer placed on it. You typically do this to open normally inaccessible features, such as administrative access, and to install apps the device vendor hasn’t approved.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Typically, you accomplish a jailbreak by conducting a series of exploits to bypass the security features of the device. For the jailbreak to persist through a reboot, you often have to disable these security features or patch the files on the device to remove them entirely. Mobile devices typically have many layers of security in place, and a persistent jailbreak typically requires punching a permanent hole all the way through to the kernel that is the core of the operating system. This, of course, leaves the device open to malicious apps and outside attacks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When vendors release new operating systems, they include fixes to patch the holes that allowed the last jailbreak to take place. The jailbreak developers then start working on a new generation of jailbreaks as the vendor releases the next beta version of its operating system, and the cycle continues.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To stop jailbreaking on a device, you could attach it to an external management solution, which installs its own apps to provide additional security <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_163"/>layers. Some might be able to prevent jailbreaking entirely or at least alert you about attempts to jailbreak the device. Mobile anti-malware apps may provide a measure of protection as well.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Malicious Apps</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Malicious apps can compromise the security of mobile devices. Mobile apps often request a great number of privileges when they’re installed; often, they can access sensitive information, log into other apps, read email, and use the network connection.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You might think you’re safe if you use an unjailbroken device and download apps from the standard operating system app store, but this isn’t the case. The measures that vendors put in place to keep malicious apps out of their stores are by no means foolproof. In January 2018, researchers from RiskIQ analyzed thousands of apps in the Apple and Google app stores and found hundreds of malicious cryptocurrency apps designed to steal coins from users.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch12fn2" id="kch12fn2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Worse still are apps designed especially for jailbroken devices, sourced from the shadowy back alleys of the internet. While the normal vendor app stores have security measures in place and at least some level of vetting for the apps in them, these back-alley apps have no such protections. They could do nearly anything in the background, out of site of the user interface, and you’d have no way of knowing at all.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To protect against malicious apps, you should stick to the standard app stores and avoid jailbroken devices. Apps from Apple’s app store are typically more secure than those from others because Apple has a higher standard for the apps it accepts. You could also use an anti-malware app for additional protection.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Updates (or Lack Thereof)</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Lastly, updates to mobile devices and their apps can cause major security problems—specifically when they don’t happen.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">People depend on the device manufacturer to issue updates to the primary and baseband operating systems, but these updates don’t always occur in a timely manner, or at all. Typically, a manufacturer will update a device consistently for two or three years and then release new updates infrequently, or never again, because it’s more profitable to sell you a new device than keep older ones up-to-date.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Apple devices tend to fare slightly better than most, but even Apple’s updates become less frequent after a few years. Google, with its looser licensing of the Android operating system, typically leaves updates up to the device’s manufacturer, so the experience there can vary. Additionally, the descriptions of device updates often lack specific details, so smaller updates, such as those to fix specific security issues, may be difficult to learn more about.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">App updates can also be problematic. Aside from the apps the device shipped with, you have no guarantee at all that an app’s creator will update the app or fix security issues, especially when it comes to smaller apps.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_164"/>You can, to a certain extent, manage the update issue yourself. By carefully selecting devices from vendors that have better track records for updates over time, you can keep these devices safer for longer. Currently, devices from Apple and those sold directly by Google receive more frequent updates and operating system upgrades. For apps, the same holds relatively true—apps from larger vendors have a higher likelihood of being updated over time.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch12lev1sec2">Embedded Security</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">An embedded device is a computer contained inside in another device that typically performs a single function. Embedded devices include everything from the computer controlling the car wash you drove through the other day to the insulin pump keeping a diabetic person healthy. Even the drivers inside some newer LED flashlights are tiny embedded devices. These devices surround us, and you’d have to go to great extremes to avoid them.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch12lev2sec3"><em>Where Embedded Devices Are Used</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">I’ve talked a little bit already about where embedded devices can be found. Now let’s look at some of the more common use cases for them.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Industrial Control Systems</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Industrial control systems and supervisory control and data acquisition systems commonly use embedded devices. An <em>industrial control system</em> is any system controlling an industrial process. A <em>supervisory control and data acquisition system</em> is a kind of industrial control system that specifically monitors and controls systems over long distances, often those related to utilities and other infrastructure.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch12fn3" id="kch12fn3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">These systems control our water systems, nuclear power plants, oil pipelines, and a variety of other critical infrastructure. If an attacker took control of or tampered with them, the effects could reach into the physical world. Triton, discussed in the previous chapter, targeted industrial control systems. The Stuxnet virus in 2007 is another excellent example of the impact of attacks against these types of systems. Believed to have been a joint project of the US and Israeli governments, Stuxnet specifically targeted the systems controlling Iran’s facilities for enriching uranium.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch12fn4" id="kch12fn4"><sup>4</sup></a> The virus tampered with the controls of the centrifuges used in the facility, causing the rotors in them to spin faster, wobbling the centrifuges until they failed. At the same time, the virus prevented the sensors detecting this activity from communicating with the safety systems that would have prevented this unusual activity.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch12fn5" id="kch12fn5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">While these devices ostensibly have high levels of security, much of it is security through obscurity, a concept I’ve discussed in previous chapters. Industrial control systems often run on proprietary real-time <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_165"/>operating systems (RTOSs), similar to the baseband operating systems used in mobile devices, and have many of the same security issues, for many of the same reasons.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frequently, these devices operate on <em>air-gapped networks</em>, which have no direct network connections to the outside. The Iranian control systems that Stuxnet attacked operated on just this type of network, and this didn’t save them from infection. You can bypass these controls with an infected USB drive so long as the facility’s staff lacks security education.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Medical Devices</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Medical devices containing embedded systems can include anything from the vital signs monitors in hospitals to the pacemakers and insulin pumps directly attached to people. Like industrial control systems, these devices commonly run RTOSs, with either minimal user interfaces or specialized interface devices required to communicate with them.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Though the cardiac device implanted in your chest to keep your heart on track may not seem like a computer with the same set of security needs as the one on your desk, it is, in fact, more closely related than might make you comfortable. In October 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning for patients and doctors using the Medtronic Cardiac Implantable Electrophysiology Device, a kind of pacemaker.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch12fn6" id="kch12fn6"><sup>6</sup></a> The FDA found that the programmer for the device didn’t communicate securely with the manufacturer when downloading updates, potentially leaving an opening for attackers to manipulate the settings of the programmer or the device itself, including sending it modified firmware.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Such an attack could be deadly. Unfortunately, just as with other devices, lack of standardization across the industry and, to some extent, the secretive and proprietary nature of these devices leads to less secure products than the battle-hardened desktop operating systems and apps we all use regularly. These devices don’t have anywhere near the number of users that the more popular operating systems have, and they aren’t as easily accessible for casual poking and prodding by attackers and security researchers. You can think of them as the delicate hothouse orchids of the operating system world.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Cars</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Cars can have as many as 70 embedded devices communicating over a network to run a vehicle. The network on which these devices communicate is called a <em>controller area network bus</em>. First developed in the early 1980s, the controller area network (CAN) bus has seen several revisions since, as vehicles have grown more complex and computerized.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For example, a car’s airbag system makes use of the CAN bus, as crash sensors all over the car watch for impacts and communicate these events across the network to the airbag control system. The airbag control system might also ask the car’s occupant detection system which seats in the car are occupied and whether the occupant is of a safe size before deploying the airbags.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_166"/>Car hacking began to heat up in the security industry a few years ago, thanks to the research of Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek, among others. Miller and Valasek succeeded in remotely controlling a hacked Jeep Cherokee. They caused it to accelerate, disabled the brakes, and even took control of the steering wheel, terrifying the reporter from <em>Wired</em> who was behind the wheel at the time, despite the reporter knowing what was going on.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch12fn7" id="kch12fn7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Clearly, the consequences of such attacks can be dire. Cars surround us every time we leave the house, and it takes only a single issue like this to put many people in danger.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For a much more in-depth discussion of the CAN bus and associated devices, their security, and how to hack them, I recommend <em>The Car Hacker’s Handbook</em> by Craig Smith, which goes into a lot of technical depth I don’t have the space to cover here.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch12lev2sec4"><em>Embedded Device Security Issues</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Embedded devices face a few specific security issues, which I’ll discuss further in this section.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Upgrading Embedded Devices</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The process of upgrading embedded devices can pose an interesting set of challenges. In many cases, you can’t upgrade embedded devices at all, or if you can, it’s often difficult to do so. Since these devices aren’t typically networked, you generally can’t update them automatically.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can update some devices, such as the pacemakers discussed earlier, with a specialized external device designed to communicate with them, but this can have its challenges also. You probably can’t completely reset an embedded device or take it in for service if you have an issue, like you can with smartphones or desktop computers. In the case of a pacemaker, you likely wouldn’t even want to frequently update the software controlling it, as the impact of a bad update could be heartbreaking (literally).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As for the hardware, engineers typically expect any embedded hardware to last the lifetime of the device it’s part of. (There are a few exceptions to this, such as the devices in industrial control systems, which typically have the support necessary to be replaced.) Short of a safety recall or a warranty repair of the larger device containing it, you’re unlikely to find many options for upgrading. To protect against this vulnerability, you should be sure to keep the hardware that depends on the embedded systems up-to-date, at least to the point that the manufacturer can still repair it, although it may be costly to do so.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Physical Impacts</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Not only do embedded devices often lack the necessary protections, but a compromised embedded device can have huge impacts. Earlier, I discussed the cases of the hacked Jeep and the uranium centrifuges in Iran. Those could be the tip of the iceberg. Many devices might impact human safety, even though some industries, such as those related to vehicles, medical <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_167"/>devices, and industrial control systems, have begun to harden their embedded systems against deliberate attacks. Because of the prevalence of such systems, there are many potential targets.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Adding to the device-specific and industry-specific issues, governments could use security issues involving embedded devices in nation-state attacks. Stuxnet was the first public example of this. As embedded devices control our power, heat, water, sanitation, food production, and countless other systems, they become likely targets when disagreements between nations escalate.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Recently, both vendors and governments have started to pay more attention to these devices. Many companies, such as SANS (<em><a href="https://ics.sans.org/">https://ics.sans.org/</a></em>), now offer security training for industrial control systems that used to be very specialized.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Unfortunately, you can’t do much to protect the physical world from the impacts of embedded devices, short of updates or fixes from the manufacturer. In some cases, you can try to fit a compensating control of some type to a specific situation, such as adding intervening layers of security, such as a firewall, to protect the device.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch12lev1sec3">Internet of Things Security</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Internet of Things (IoT) devices are prevalent, and they’re becoming more so—gradually creeping into our toasters, refrigerators, and other appliances so that we can reach them from the internet. With this, of course, comes a host of security issues.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch12lev2sec5"><em>What Is an IoT Device?</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In 1999, Kevin Ashton coined the term <em>Internet of Things</em> while working with the Auto-ID Center.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch12fn8" id="kch12fn8"><sup>8</sup></a> The term referred what he saw as the increasing need to provide network connectivity to track and connect a wide variety of parts and devices. Today, we use the term to refer to any device with an internet connection that doesn’t run a full desktop operating system.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The term is broad, and since the world of IoT is still a bit of a frontier, many of the concepts and ideas related to it are open to interpretation. Let’s talk briefly about a few of the more common IoT devices.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Printers</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Although common, network printers often go unnoticed in offices and homes. We often treat them as something along the lines of a toaster, when in reality, they’re complex devices with operating systems like any other computer, capable of communicating on one or more networks, and with plenty of starting places for an attacker to attempt to gain a foothold. Printers generally use an RTOS on a small embedded device, which drives the printer hardware. Hewlett-Packard LaserJet printers run LynxOS operating systems.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch12fn9" id="kch12fn9"><sup>9</sup></a> These devices listen on a variety of ports and run common services, such as FTP, Telnet, SSH, and HTTP/HTTPS, along with several services peculiar to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_168"/>printing devices. Additionally, they’ll typically have both wired and wireless network adapters. Printers also commonly come equipped with a reasonable amount of memory and storage to support the large print jobs sent to them.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">While attacks on these devices are not terribly common, they do occasionally succumb to vulnerabilities. One of the more recent ones, the KRACK vulnerability, can allow attackers to eavesdrop on traffic sent wirelessly to one of these devices and to access sensitive documents.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch12fn10" id="kch12fn10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Surveillance Cameras</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Networked surveillance cameras, another common type of device, are frequently full of vulnerabilities. Some vendors develop and maintain their camera models well, but others don’t. You can put together a networked camera simply by running a few services on a lightweight platform (often Linux) at a low price. Certain manufacturers create these devices with little testing, developing their product by modifying the source code of other projects.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">These devices often have simple default administrative credentials, backdoors enabling unauthorized use of the device, or hordes of security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. Malware can easily take advantage of them to conduct attacks against other devices or to serve as an entry into deeper parts of the environment.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Physical Security Devices</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Physical security devices include tools such as smart locks, which connect to a network (often Bluetooth or Bluetooth Low-Energy) and allow you to open and close a lock through a mobile app or other software.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Smart locks save you the inconvenience of having to carry around a key or remember a combination. In some cases, simply bringing your mobile device within range of the lock will open the lock; you don’t have to take any direct action at all. As you might expect, this doesn’t always help the security of the device.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In July 2018, the company Pen Test Partners undertook research on the Tapplock (<em><a href="https://tapplock.com/">https://tapplock.com/</a></em>) smart padlock, which you open through a mobile app. The company discovered that the unlock code sent to the device was static and replayable, meaning that, even without the associated app, you could just tell the device to unlock directly via Bluetooth and it would do so. They also learned that the unlock code relied on the MAC address broadcast by the device and could be easily calculated by an attacker.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch12fn11" id="kch12fn11"><sup>11</sup></a> To add insult to injury, another researcher discovered vulnerabilities in the API behind the Tapplock that allowed attackers to attach any lock to their account, retrieve the physical location where the app last unlocked the lock, and unlock the lock via the app.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch12fn12" id="kch12fn12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you try to make every device into an IoT device, you’ll likely face vulnerabilities such as these. Although you gain convenience from the smart lock, putting a device like a lock behind an open API literally accessible to anyone with a computer on the internet causes serious vulnerabilities. Even when you put a great deal of effort into strong security, there will always be vulnerabilities present and someone will always be there to exploit them.</p>&#13;
<div class="sidebar">&#13;
<p class="sidebart"><strong>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EMBEDDED AND IOT DEVICES</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The line between an embedded device and an Internet of Things device is a bit of a fuzzy one, and people often disagree about the definitions of each. There are, however, a few relatively high-level differences.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Embedded devices generally aren’t designed for regular interactions with a person. Both devices are often wrapped up inside another device, which may have a user interface of some kind, but the embedded one usually hides behind the scenes, and it tends to have simpler interfaces that allow you to turn it on or off or make adjustments to its settings.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Also, embedded devices aren’t typically connected to the internet, although some embedded devices, such as the embedded devices found in cars, are connected to internal networks. Some people might argue that providing an embedded device with an internet connection would move it into the IoT device category.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_169"/></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch12lev2sec6"><em>IoT Security Issues</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">IoT devices, of course, face several specific security issues stemming from their network connections.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Lack of Transparency</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Often, you won’t know exactly what your IoT devices are doing. Although they have limited user interfaces, they typically contain similar sets of features as your mobile device and desktop computer. When your IoT device is idling on the network, it could be communicating with anyone. You won’t always be able to tell if it’s doing something unusual or unexpected.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Unless you put specific instrumentation in place to discover what these devices are doing, you don’t really have any way of answering those questions. An advanced user might be able to log into a command line interface on the device and interrogate it slightly further, but you might not be able to glean much additional information aside from tidbits of data from the file system and logs.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">One way of discovering what exactly an IoT device is doing is to connect the device to a virtual private network to isolate the device (making its traffic easier to distinguish) and force it to communicate through a monitorable choke point and then use a tool such as mitmproxy (<em><a href="https://mitmproxy.org/">https://mitmproxy.org/</a></em>) to eavesdrop on it and see who exactly the device is trying to talk to and what data is being sent or received. You can find this tool and accompanying scripts in the Data-Life project on GitHub (<em><a href="https://github.com/abcnews/data-life/">https://github.com/abcnews/data-life/</a></em>). If the device is sufficiently chatty on the network, you’ll have to sift through many results to identify the devices on the other end of the connection. You can expect to see most IoT devices communicating with a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_170"/>variety of other devices under normal operation. They might, for example, ask for updates from the vendor, talk to APIs, and check the time against time servers.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Everything Is an IoT Device</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">All sorts of appliances now ship with “smart” capabilities and network connectivity of some variety. Even lightbulbs and exercise machines talk to the internet. As I’ve discussed, devices have their own specific security failings, but they also face issues that arise from just having such a large mass of devices on the internet.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In October 2016, an enormous distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack left massive swaths of the internet unusable, including services from large providers such as Amazon Web Services, Twitter, Netflix, and CNN. These outages stemmed from DDoS attacks against Dyn, the company controlling many of the root DNS servers forming the infrastructure of the internet. The attack against these servers had a rate of 1.2 terabytes per second, at the time the largest DDoS attack ever witnessed, and came from more than 100,000 devices, almost all of which were IoT devices.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch12fn13" id="kch12fn13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The attack was possible because malware called Mirai recruited vulnerable IoT devices into a <em>botnet</em> (a network of compromised systems) and made them accessible for the controllers of the botnet to use for DDoS attacks. The malware didn’t perform a complex attack; it simply looked for devices on the network and attempted to access them using their default administrative password.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Of course, users could have prevented this problem by changing the administrative password when they first configured the device, but unfortunately, users rarely do so. When wireless access points first became common, they faced similar issues. Manufacturers will likely resolve this vulnerability the same way they resolved the vulnerabilities in the wireless access points: by shipping devices in a secure state by default.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Outdated Devices</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In addition to the large number of vulnerable devices on the market, the many old devices on the market cause security problems. IoT devices of some variety have existed for about 20 years now. Even if no insecure devices left any factory starting today, these old devices could remain in operation for at least the next decade.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">It’s not easy to add security measures to older devices. You could update the firmware to patch holes in certain devices, but this would require performing updates, which most devices don’t automatically download. The many nontechnical people with IoT devices in their homes are unlikely to understand both why these devices need to be updated and how to do so.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch12lev1sec4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_171"/>Summary</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, I discussed mobile devices, embedded devices, and IoT devices. Each of these categories faces a particular set of potential security issues, which you can mitigate to varying extents.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When it comes to mobile devices, the baseboard operating system, jailbreaking, and malicious apps can threaten your security. However, you can take certain steps to manage mobile devices and, to a certain extent, control how people use them, particularly in corporate environments. Embedded devices, which are present in many critical systems, have the potential to cause physical impacts well beyond the device itself, while IoT devices, or devices with a network connection, are particularly difficult to monitor and secure.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">From a security perspective, these devices are just as important as traditional computers, even if they’re rarely considered.</p>&#13;

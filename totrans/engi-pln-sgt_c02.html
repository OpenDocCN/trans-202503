<h2 id="h1-502321c02-0001">Introduction</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Communication isn’t unique to the human species, but telecommunication is. Sharing information beyond a shouting distance requires plenty of innovation. Many of humankind’s most significant developments have been ways of sending and receiving messages across expanses. From smoke signals and carrier pigeons to GPS and the internet, telecommunications have profoundly shaped the ways we live, work, and play. </p>
<p>This chapter explores how we send and receive information over long distances, and, most important, the infrastructure that makes it all possible—or at least it does at the time of writing. No other part of society seems to be changing more rapidly than our communications technologies. In 10 years, this chapter may seem outdated. In 20 years, the technology described here may be unrecognizable. It is already easy to take such systems for granted in the Information Age, but captivating details still exist in the engineering behind how we transfer and share knowledge, entertainment, and so much more.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c02-0002"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_41" title="41"/>Overhead Telecommunications</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The majority of our <em>telecommunications</em> occurs through physical lines, either metal wires or glass fibers, and these lines can run in essentially two places to avoid conflicts with other human activities: through the air or below the ground (underwater is a third option in some situations). This section covers the former, and the next section discusses underground installations. </p>
<p>Overhead communication lines are almost always carried on poles along with other utilities. <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 1">Chapter 1</span> provides a look at utility poles for electricity distribution, but that’s not their only use. <span class="SmallCaps">Joint poles</span> are those shared among multiple utilities. Not every joint pole supports every kind of utility, but no matter which lines run along the pole, all their locations are carefully prescribed. <span class="SmallCaps">Primary electrical distribution</span> lines run along the tops of the poles, farthest from the ground since they have the greatest potential for danger. The <span class="SmallCaps">secondary electrical lines</span> that service customers run directly below them. Between the electrical and communications lines is a <span class="SmallCaps">safety space</span> reserved for utility workers to make connections and perform maintenance without being exposed to the danger of high-voltage lines. The <span class="SmallCaps">communication space</span> is the lowest along the poles, because these lines don’t pose a shock hazard and require more frequent maintenance.</p>
<p>Although many different types of communication lines can be strung overhead along poles, only three make up the preponderance of what you can observe on a standard pole: <span class="SmallCaps">telephone</span>, coaxial <span class="SmallCaps">cable TV</span>, and <span class="SmallCaps">fiber-optic</span> lines. Seeing all three running in parallel on the same poles isn’t uncommon, and telling them apart is easy if you know what to look for. </p>
<p>Stringing wires across long distances can create significant tension forces, and most communication lines aren’t meant to support their own weight as they span from pole to pole. Instead, a steel <span class="SmallCaps">messenger wire</span> provides this needed support. The communication cables are lashed to the messenger wire, or in the case of <span class="SmallCaps">figure-8 cables</span>, the messenger wire is incorporated into the protective <span class="SmallCaps">outer jacket</span>.</p>
<p>Although the network of copper lines that make up the <em>plain-old telephone service </em>(<em>POTS</em>) are quickly being phased out, they still can be seen on poles around the world. Since 1876, we’ve been transmitting voice signals along dedicated circuits of copper wire, and it’s still the simplest way for a home or business to connect to the telephone network in many places. Each landline consists of a <span class="SmallCaps">twisted pair</span> of thin copper wires. Since every household and business can have its own direct lines to the <em>local telephone exchange</em>, the cables can grow quite large, sometimes containing hundreds or thousands of pairs. The lines join together into larger and larger cables at splices, easily visible by the boxy black <span class="SmallCaps">splice enclosures</span> seen near poles.</p>
<p>All these wires running in parallel alongside each other would naturally <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_42" title="42"/>create electromagnetic interference and “cross-talk” between circuits. However, twisting each pair of wires in a phone line creatively solves this problem because the undesired interference affects each wire of the twisted pair equally. The desired communications signal is sent in the voltage difference between the two wires of the twisted pair, so any unwanted voltage common to both wires is subtracted out.</p>
<p>Another ubiquitous telecommunication medium is the cable TV network (often abbreviated as <em>CATV</em>). Despite the name, most CATV networks support telephone and high-speed internet service in addition to television programming. Like POTS, the CATV network begins at a central location, which is called the <em>head-end</em>. From there, the signals are distributed mostly using <span class="SmallCaps">coaxial cable</span>, named because the inner conductor and surrounding metal shield are concentric around a common axis. These cables can carry high-frequency radio signals with very low losses or issues with interference because of the shielding effect of the outer conductor. They start as large trunks that feed multiple distribution lines. <span class="SmallCaps">Amplifiers</span> (also called <em>line extenders</em> and recognizable by their heat-dissipating fins) are spaced along trunks to boost the signal. A <span class="SmallCaps">catv power supply</span> provides the necessary power for all the amplifiers within a large radius. <span class="SmallCaps">Taps</span> in the distribution lines allow the connection of <span class="SmallCaps">drops</span>, which provide service to each individual customer. CATV trunks and distribution lines are easily recognizable by their <span class="SmallCaps">expansion loops</span>. These loops are present because coaxial cables are rigid, and they expand and contract with changes in temperature at a different rate than the messenger wire. Without room for thermal movement, they can suffer undue stresses and deterioration and even pull themselves out of connections.</p>
<p>Both cable and telephone providers now often use fiber-optic cables in combination with copper wires or coaxial cables to distribute higher quality and more reliable signals. These cables utilize bundles of glass or plastic fibers to transmit signals as pulses of light. Fiber-optic signals can travel huge distances with very little loss because they are immune to electromagnetic interference. The outside of the cable sometimes includes an orange or yellow <span class="SmallCaps">marker</span> or overwrap, making it easy to distinguish from telephone or CATV.</p>
<p>Fiber-optic networks are usually designed to allow for future expansion by including more fibers than needed. However, a major challenge with these cables is that they are difficult to splice. Rather than a simple physical connection required for an electrical splice, fiber-optic cables need much more care to avoid scattering or reflection of the light signal. The individual fibers must be stripped, cleaned, cleaved, aligned, and precisely joined, often using heat to fuse them together. Instead of performing this careful operation on a ladder or in a bucket truck, many utilities prefer to add new connections or repair their fiber-optic cables in specialized <em>splicing trucks</em>. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_43" title="43"/>That means the cables need enough slack to be lowered to the ground, and these <span class="SmallCaps">slack loops</span> are usually stored along the main cable. Fiber-optic cables cannot have sharp bends or twists, which could break the fibers, so <span class="SmallCaps">storage brackets</span> (often simply called <em>snowshoes</em> for their distinctive appearance) allow changes in direction and storage of slack without causing damage to the cable.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">The electrical signals used in copper wire telephone systems are relatively small, so they usually cannot travel over long distances. That means almost all of us live and work within a few miles of a local telephone exchange. These days, most telephone switching happens on server racks in data centers, but many of the original exchange buildings still exist. These buildings, also called central offices, are owned by the service provider to house the equipment and switches that connect individual lines to the massive telephone network. They are usually generic and windowless, difficult to notice unless you’re paying close attention. A few hints are the security cameras, air conditioners to keep all that equipment cool, and backup generators to power the system in the event of a blackout.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c02-0003"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_45" title="45"/>Underground Telecommunications</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Routing communication lines underground rather than overhead along utility poles has some serious advantages. The lines don’t require a supporting strand to bear their weight across poles. They are also less obtrusive and avoid adding visual clutter to the landscape. Finally, they are protected from a whole host of threats including birds, squirrels, wind, ice, sunlight, and errant vehicles crashing into poles. That means underground communication lines are usually more reliable, even though they require higher upfront costs for installation.</p>
<p>Underground utilities are usually placed inside protective <span class="SmallCaps">ducts</span> installed in one of two ways: <em>trenching</em> or <em>directional boring</em>. Trenching is accomplished using an <span class="SmallCaps">excavator</span> to dig a linear hole (that is, a <span class="SmallCaps">trench</span>) in the ground. The duct is placed within the hole, which is then backfilled with soil. <span class="SmallCaps">Warning tape</span> is installed while backfilling to mark the presence of the cable to anyone who may be excavating around the line in the future. Some of these tapes even include wires or steel ribbons so that they can be detected from the ground surface, making it easier to locate the line in the future. The major disadvantage of trenching is the disruption caused to anything on the surface. The area must be closed off during construction, and sidewalks, roadways, and lawns have to be repaired after backfilling the trench. These repairs never seem to be as durable or attractive as the original.</p>
<p>Directional boring reduces the disturbance on the surface by installing ducts inside a <span class="SmallCaps">borehole</span> without a trench. This method is especially advantageous for getting lines across rivers, congested urban areas, and critical roadways where it wouldn’t be feasible to use a trench. A <span class="SmallCaps">directional drill rig</span> on the surface first bores a pilot hole between the <span class="SmallCaps">entrance pit</span> and the exit. Workers use sensing equipment on the <span class="SmallCaps">drill string</span> and at the surface to monitor the drill’s path belowground. To steer the drill, the leading edge of the string is asymmetric. It can be clocked to any position, and the string will naturally wander in the preferred direction during drilling. Once the pilot hole is complete, the drill string is retracted with a <span class="SmallCaps">reamer</span> to enlarge the bore while pulling the duct from a <span class="SmallCaps">spool</span>, creating a continuous path for cables to run. </p>
<p>Since they’re hidden below the surface, you can’t see underground telecommunication lines like you can with aerial installations. However, these cables have to surface eventually, so there are plenty of opportunities for spotting them. The simplest structure associated with underground utilities is a <span class="SmallCaps">cable vault</span>, a belowground enclosure that allows access to the ducts. Vaults are evident on the surface from their lids (which are often large rectangles and include details about what’s inside).</p>

<figure class="graphic"><img alt="" class="" src="image_fi/502321c02/g02005.png"/></figure>
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Buried cables have another major disadvantage besides cost: moisture. Rain, melting snow, and groundwater can find their way into the ducts that carry telecommunication lines below the ground. Not only does water cause corrosion if it gets inside a cable jacket, but it can also create short circuits and signal degradation. Moisture is mostly a problem for telephone lines (as opposed to coaxial or fiber-optic cables), because they have so many individual copper wires, and older cables were often insulated using paper. To counteract the intrusion of moisture, many telephone cables are pressurized with air inside the sheath using a compressor near the central telephone office. However, occasionally you’ll see a nitrogen tank on a sidewalk or beside a street to pressurize underground lines. This pressurization helps the sheath resist the intrusion of water. Also, by monitoring the pressure, technicians can find and diagnose problems with the line before serious deterioration occurs. Any breaks or holes in the line will allow the air or nitrogen to leak and the pressure to drop over time.  Most newer telephone cables are filled with a water-repellant gel, but plenty of these air-filled underground lines serve as a testament to the clever use of pressure for preventive maintenance.</p>

<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_47" title="47"/>Another structure associated with underground telecommunications is the <span class="SmallCaps">communications cabinet</span>. These cabinets are located aboveground and may house a wide variety of equipment for many different types of service providers, so you have to be a sleuth if you want to know exactly what’s inside. The first clue is the labels. Sometimes you can find a company name or contact information on the cabinet giving a hint as to what kind of equipment it contains. Usually, cabinets serve as simple connection points, conveniently accessible locations for splicing a high-capacity trunk or feeder cable to smaller distribution lines that spread out toward customers. In such a case, the cabinet houses <span class="SmallCaps">jumper</span> equipment allowing technicians to make connections for CATV, telephone, or fiber-optic lines.</p>
<p>Some communications cabinets house <em>active</em> (in other words, powered) equipment. In these cases, a <span class="SmallCaps">voltage warning</span> likely will be somewhere on the outside, and the housing will have <span class="SmallCaps">louvers</span>, since these devices often need ventilation to dissipate heat. Active equipment could include power supplies for the CATV network or <em>optical nodes</em> that convert fiber-optic signals into radio frequencies that can be distributed using coaxial cables. </p>
<p>Finally, these cabinets occasionally contain more sophisticated equipment that allows a telephone line to transmit information at much higher speed and fidelity than it could if it were connected directly to the nearest central office. These devices, called <em>remote concentrators</em>, digitize the signals from individual telephone customers and combine them into a fiber-optic signal directly to the central office, allowing telephone companies to service a larger number of customers and provide higher quality voice and high-speed data services.</p>
<p>Another sign of underground communication lines is the <span class="SmallCaps">pedestal</span>. These ubiquitous housings are usually termination points, providing the connection between a larger distribution line and smaller cables that fan out toward customers for CATV, telephone, or other telecommunication services. They usually include an access panel or allow the housing to be removed so that technicians can make connections or troubleshoot problems. For CATV, they may include a <span class="SmallCaps">tap</span> to provide multiple service drops. For telephone, they usually conceal only cable <span class="SmallCaps">splices</span> and not much else.</p>
<p>One last piece of equipment associated with underground utilities is the <span class="SmallCaps">repeater</span>. <em>T1</em> and <em>DSL</em> are two common types of high-speed digital signals that can be transmitted along standard copper telephone lines. However, because of their high frequency compared with voice signals, these high-speed digital signals cannot travel far without becoming too attenuated or distorted. In rural areas with longer distances between telephone offices, these lines need repeaters to maintain the signal fidelity. The repeaters are normally housed in waterproof enclosures shaped like paint cans or crock pots. They’ll show up at regular intervals along the line, usually every mile or two.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c02-0004"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_49" title="49"/>Radio Antenna Towers</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Radio communication uses invisible waves of electromagnetic radiation to carry information across space. This simple but remarkable technology enables a wide variety of wireless devices, from garage door openers to cell phones. If humans could sense the full spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, we would be completely overwhelmed by the volume and variety of information moving through the airwaves. </p>
<p>Many of the frequencies used for communication, including those broadcast by radio and television stations, require a line of sight; the path between the transmitter and receiver must be relatively unobstructed. Radio signals generally can’t reach beyond the horizon, which is why many <em>antennas</em> are mounted at the tops of gigantic <span class="SmallCaps">towers</span> (sometimes also called <em>masts</em>). The higher they are, the farther their signals can extend. Antenna towers are some of the tallest human-made structures in the world, with many topping out above 600 meters (about 2,000 feet). They are so tall that they often pose a danger to aircraft and often must be painted with alternating bands of orange and white color and feature <span class="SmallCaps">warning lights</span> at the top. These towers serve a critical role in modern society, enabling wide transmission of radio and television signals, communications for emergency first responders, and more.</p>
<p>Radio antenna towers can take many forms, but there are two main categories of structure (not including the spires atop tall buildings): <span class="SmallCaps">self-supporting</span> and <span class="SmallCaps">guyed</span>. Self-supporting towers are designed to be freestanding and stable against the wind entirely on their own. They are usually made from steel or concrete with a broad base to provide stiffness against the forces of Mother Nature. Self-supporting towers don’t take up much space, so they are ideal in urban areas where land comes at a premium. However, they are more expensive to construct than their counterpart because of the extra material required for stability against lateral wind loads. </p>
<p>Guyed towers usually consist of a slender lattice structure supported by multiple steel cables (the <span class="SmallCaps">guy wires</span>). Guyed towers can be thin because they don’t have to provide stiffness against the force of the wind. The guys provide this lateral support so that the tower has to support only its own weight. In fact, some guyed towers come to a narrow point at the ground so that any minor swaying will cause only a pivot instead of bending or flexing of the tower. The guy wires are usually arranged in an equilateral triangle to provide support no matter which direction the wind blows.</p>
<p>There are many ways to anchor the guy wires to the ground, depending on the type of soil or rock at the site and expected loads. The <span class="SmallCaps">anchors</span> often consist of one or more deep drilled holes with a steel rod grouted inside to create a rigid connection to the earth. Because the guy wires extend so far from the tower base, guyed towers require much more space than self-supporting <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_50" title="50"/>structures. They are mostly located in rural areas where land is less expensive. </p>
<p>Entertainment programming or other signals arrive at a tower site for broadcast from a radio transmitter. The transmitter is usually located away from the tower inside an environmentally controlled <span class="SmallCaps">transmitter building</span>. For AM radio stations, the tower itself is the antenna and there may be a tuning hut at the tower base that houses equipment needed to efficiently transfer power from the transmitter to the tower. For FM and TV stations, the <span class="SmallCaps">feed line</span> (also called a transmission line) carries the signal from the transmitter up to the antenna, which is attached to the tower structure. In colder areas, the horizontal run of feed line from the transmitter building to the tower is protected from falling ice by an <span class="SmallCaps">ice bridge</span>. The <em>antenna</em> is the device that radiates the signal as electromagnetic waves. Since towers are fairly expensive and obtrusive, they are often shared among many stations or other users (called <em>colocation</em>). Tower owners lease space inside the transmitter building and on the tower structure to radio and television stations, police and fire departments, government agencies, and various private companies for their own wireless communication systems. </p>
<p>Like the towers to which they’re attached, these antennas can take a wide variety of interesting shapes, depending on the frequency, direction, and power of the signal.<span class="SmallCaps"> Omnidirectional antennas</span> transmit radio waves in all directions equally and often have a cylindrical shape. They include <span class="SmallCaps">monopole antennas</span>, straight conductive elements that require a ground plane (sometimes the ground itself and sometimes consisting of radial, horizontal conductors). <span class="SmallCaps">Dipole antennas</span> are another kind of omnidirectional antenna that consist of two identical radiating elements, one above the other.</p>
<p><em>Directional antennas</em> focus radio waves in a specific direction. <span class="SmallCaps">Parabolic antennas</span> have a solid or gridded wire dish to reflect and focus radio waves. <span class="SmallCaps">Yagi antennas</span> use a single energized dipole and several non-energized elements to focus the waves in the desired direction. Similar in appearance, <span class="SmallCaps">log-periodic antennas</span> use a series of dipoles, each of a slightly different length to send or receive a wide range of radio frequencies.<span class="SmallCaps"> </span>Simple antenna elements, such as dipoles, can be combined into <span class="SmallCaps">arrays</span> that work together to direct waves into a beam or a specific pattern. (A few other types of antennas, including those used for cellular phone service, are discussed in another section.)</p>
<p>Like all infrastructure, antenna towers require occasional maintenance. Technicians with specialized training for heights and electrical hazards perform inspections and upkeep on these structures. Very tall towers may be equipped with elevators to provide access for painting, repairs, and equipment changes. Shorter towers require the technician to climb to the top. </p>
<p>Although the frequencies used for wireless communication are <em>non-ionizing</em> (meaning the waves can’t break apart atoms), that doesn’t mean they aren’t dangerous. Electromagnetic radiation can <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_51" title="51"/>generate heat in water-containing objects, including people. (Microwave ovens take advantage of this effect to warm our food.) That’s why public access is restricted near antennas that transmit at high power. Workers who maintain these towers have to make sure to keep their distance from energized antennas or power them down before working nearby to avoid unsafe exposure.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst"><em>AM radio</em> signals use very low frequencies, so they require very large antennas. In most cases, an AM station will broadcast using the metal tower itself as the antenna. Because the entire tower is energized, it has to be insulated from the ground. If you look closely, these towers usually sit entirely atop a small ceramic insulator. The need for complete isolation from the ground creates a number of interesting challenges, one of which is how to protect the tower and the attached equipment against damage due to lightning. Many AM towers use <em>spark gaps</em> to keep the tower insulated while allowing voltage surges to be diverted safely into the ground. During normal operation, no current conducts across the gap. However, if lightning strikes the tower, the air will ionize between the contacts, creating an arc, and providing a conductive path to ground for the voltage spike.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c02-0005"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_53" title="53"/>Satellite Communications</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">There is a practical limit to the height of an antenna mast. Eventually, the financial, engineering, and safety challenges make it infeasible to build taller. Luckily, there is another way to get an antenna high in the sky. <span class="SmallCaps">Satellites</span> are devices placed into orbit around the Earth using rockets. They are the pinnacle of wireless communications, at least in terms of range. Many satellites can transmit and receive radio signals from one-third of the globe simultaneously, considerably farther than even the tallest towers. These days we use satellites for a wide variety of communications, including radio, television, internet, telephone, navigation, weather, environmental monitoring, and so much more. Satellites used for communications are essentially relays, receiving signals from one location on the ground and amplifying and redirecting them back to somewhere else on Earth. This relay creates a communications channel that does not require a direct connection through wires and that isn’t so limited in range by the curvature of the Earth like ground-based antennas.</p>
<p>Communication satellites can be placed into a wide variety of orbits around the Earth. The speed at which a satellite orbits is directly related to its <em>altitude</em>. The higher the orbit, the longer it takes to go around. Satellites in <span class="SmallCaps">low-Earth orbit</span> circle the globe many times per day, so they are overhead a specific location for only short periods of time. A group of satellites in overlapping orbits, called a <span class="SmallCaps">constellation</span>, is required to maintain continuous service. Each satellite is strategically placed so that any location on the ground has at least one satellite within line of sight at all times. Low-Earth orbiting satellites require less power to transmit and receive, and communications experience less delay, since they are closer to the Earth. They also do not require a large antenna to receive their signals. In fact, you probably carry an antenna in your pocket that regularly pings low-Earth satellites: the <em>GPS</em> antenna in your cell phone. However, low-Earth satellites do have to account for <span class="SmallCaps">Doppler shift</span>. Because the satellites move so quickly compared to an observer on Earth, the radio waves compress while moving toward an antenna and stretch out as they pass by overhead, complicating the job of receiving and decoding the signals.</p>
<p>At an altitude of approximately 36,000 kilometers (22,000 miles), the <em>orbital period</em> of a satellite is 24 hours, exactly the length of a day. A satellite at this altitude around earth’s <span class="SmallCaps">equator</span> is in a <span class="SmallCaps">geostationary orbit</span> because it remains in a fixed position in the sky as the Earth rotates. Although it takes considerable effort to launch into an orbit so high above the Earth, <span class="SmallCaps">geostationary satellites</span> have some significant advantages. Because they don’t move relative to the ground, antennas can be mounted in a fixed position, simplifying their design. Geostationary satellites also have a much larger range since they have a line of sight that covers <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_54" title="54"/>about 40 percent of the globe. Only the Earth’s <span class="SmallCaps">poles</span> are difficult to reach from this orbit.</p>
<p>One limitation of geostationary satellites is that they are constrained to a single ring (called the <em>Clarke Belt</em>) above the Earth’s equator. To avoid satellites interfering with each other’s signals, the international telecommunications community agreed to designate individual locations (called slots) around this ring like parcels of real estate. The geostationary ring is so congested that it has a waiting list. Once a satellite has reached the end of its useful life, it must move out of its slot so that a replacement or a new satellite on the waiting list can take its place.</p>
<p>The other disadvantage with geostationary satellites is their large distance from the Earth. Sending and receiving radio signals across this great expanse is a major challenge. The antennas used to overcome this distance are instantly recognizable. A <span class="SmallCaps">satellite dish </span>uses a curved <span class="SmallCaps">reflector</span> to gather the faint radio signals and focus them into the <span class="SmallCaps">feedhorn</span>. This metal cone transitions the waves into the <span class="SmallCaps">low-noise block</span>, the heart of the satellite antenna that includes electronic circuitry to perform two primary functions. First, it amplifies the weak radio signal to a more usable level. Second, it takes the high-frequency signal used for long-distance wireless transmission and <em>downconverts</em> it to a lower frequency that can travel efficiently through a cable. </p>
<p>Antennas that transmit signals to geostationary satellites are usually much larger but otherwise work in the same way, with equipment for amplifying and converting the frequency and a reflector to direct the waves to the correct location in the sky. The <span class="SmallCaps">mast</span> supporting the dish can be attached to a permanent mount or motorized tracking mount, depending on whether it communicates with only one or multiple geostationary satellites.</p>
<p>Some satellites are large enough and reflective enough to be seen from the ground at night. In fact, with so many orbiting the Earth these days, spotting satellites is a popular hobby. Many websites keep track of satellite orbits and offer predictions about when and where they might be seen and how bright they will appear in the sky. That brightness comes from glints of sunlight reflected off solar panels or shiny surfaces down to Earth, which is why satellites are most visible for a few hours right after nightfall or right before dawn. During those times, the sky is dark from Earth’s shadow (sometimes called the <span class="SmallCaps">twilight wedge</span>), but the sun is close enough to the horizon to illuminate objects high above the ground. The most famous satellite orbiting Earth, the International Space Station, is also the largest and most visible. In most parts of the world, you’re likely to be able to see this feat of modern engineering zoom across the night sky at least a few times per month. It is a spectacular sight.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Because they orbit much farther from Earth, geostationary satellites are illuminated by the sun all night long. However, that distance also means they appear much dimmer in the night sky. Usually, these satellites can only be seen with a telescope, but there’s another clever way to observe them: long-exposure photography. Point a camera on a tripod at the celestial equator and open the shutter for two to four minutes. In the resulting photograph, you’ll see the long trails of stars caused by rotation of the Earth. But, if you look closely, you should see a row of pinpoint lights. These are the geostationary satellites orbiting at the exact speed of the Earth’s rotation, so they always appear in the same part of the sky.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c02-0006"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_57" title="57"/>Cellular Communications</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Most wireless communications involve either one-way broadcast of a signal (for example, AM and FM radio) or two-way transmissions between a limited group (such as a police dispatch network). The availability of different frequencies on the electromagnetic spectrum used for separate “channels” of communication is limited. On top of that, there’s a lot of competition for those limited bands among the wide variety of radio signal users, including public safety organizations like police and fire departments, military, aircraft traffic control, television and radio stations, and many more. Enabling wireless telephony and internet connectivity to the greater public is a major engineering challenge. Within only a narrow range of frequencies, wireless carriers have innovated ways to connect anyone with a mobile device to both the telephone network and the internet. The fundamental innovation making this possible is the subdivision of large service areas into smaller <span class="SmallCaps">cells</span>—hence the name, cellular communications.</p>
<p>Although it would seem more economical to mount communication antennas atop tall towers to reach the largest possible area, that would allow only a few connections at a time (one per channel within the available band of radio frequencies). Instead, carriers install many smaller antennas spread out across the landscape to service manageable groups of customers. This strategy allows billions of individual wireless transmissions per day on only a few hundred channels, since nonadjacent cells can reuse the same channels (shown as different colors in the illustration). Each cellular service carrier builds its own grid of cells providing coverage to all but the least traveled areas. Although idealized as a regular hexagonal grid, each cell’s size and shape is determined by the topography, availability of antenna mounting locations, and especially, demand for service. Densely populated areas have smaller cells, while the cells in rural areas can be much larger. </p>
<p>The creation of all these cells has left a mark across the landscape in the form of <span class="SmallCaps">base stations</span>. A base station (also known as a <em>cell site</em>) has all the infrastructure needed to provide service to one or more wireless cells, usually including a tower, antennas, amplifiers, signal processing equipment, a backhaul connection to the network, and sometimes batteries or a <span class="SmallCaps">backup generator</span> for power outages. </p>
<p>The ubiquitous towers used to mount the antennas are a familiar sight. In urban settings, they are usually <span class="SmallCaps">monopoles</span> or lattice structures. Often, the signal processing is done in a <span class="SmallCaps">remote radio head</span> located adjacent to the antennas, and other times the radio equipment is located in an <span class="SmallCaps">equipment cabinet</span> on the ground. <span class="SmallCaps">Lightning rods</span> protect the sensitive equipment from strikes. The antennas also need deterrents to prevent damage by wildlife. If you look closely, you’ll see a wide variety of creative approaches to this <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_58" title="58"/>challenge. The most common are predatory <span class="SmallCaps">decoys</span> (usually owls) that scare birds away or plastic <span class="SmallCaps">bird spikes</span> that make climbing or roosting on antennas difficult. Another item you may notice on a tower is a <span class="SmallCaps">gps antenna</span>. This antenna is usually shaped like an egg and collects an accurate clock signal from overhead satellites required for synchronization of the signal processing equipment.</p>
<p>Base stations aren’t always standalone towers, though. Keep your eyes open in urban areas, and you’ll notice antennas on just about any tall structure, including buildings, water towers, utility poles, and even billboards. In fact, a highly developed economy exists around leasing space for cell site installations, complete with agents, investment firms, and all the other players in the traditional real estate market. Often, carriers will share a tower or a building to save cost and reduce the visual impact on the landscape of this conspicuous type of infrastructure. You’ll often see two or more <span class="SmallCaps">antenna levels</span> on the same tower. Another way to curb a cell tower’s obviousness is to disguise it as something more natural like a tree or cactus. Some of these so-called <span class="SmallCaps">stealth cell sites</span> are more stealthy than others.</p>
<p>These days, you’re almost always within view of a set of the rectangular <span class="SmallCaps">sector antennas</span> used to send and receive the signals used by mobile devices. These antennas are highly directional to maintain clear boundaries between cells, usually targeting a 120-degree swath of territory. The triangular <span class="SmallCaps">platforms</span> atop some towers allow for antennas to service three cells from one station, and each antenna is carefully aimed to avoid interference with neighboring cells. You may notice some antennas are tilted downward to reduce the spread of signal beyond the cell boundaries. The <span class="SmallCaps">radiation pattern</span> of each antenna sector is roughly circular. When you account for the necessary overlap to allow for the digital handoff if a device moves from one cell to another, you get a roughly hexagonal grid.</p>
<p>The connection of each base station to the core network is called the <em>backhaul</em>. In most cases, a cellular base station’s backhaul is accomplished using a fiber-optic cable to the nearest switching center. In instances where fiber installation isn’t feasible, carriers can use a wireless backhaul. The circular protrusions you occasionally see from cell towers shaped like bass drums are actually high-capacity <span class="SmallCaps">microwave antennas</span>. Below the protective covering is a parabolic dish similar to those used for sending and receiving signals from satellites. These antennas are directional. If you could look down the center of one, you’d see its pair mounted on a tower in the distance facing directly back at you.</p>
<p>Cellular infrastructure is probably the most rapidly evolving of all the topics covered in this book. What started as a means to provide mobile telephone service is now the primary access to the internet for many. Voice conversations have become a secondary feature of a mobile phone to the point that many prefer the term “device” <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_59" title="59"/>over “phone.” As more and more gadgets gain internet connectivity (often described as the <em>Internet of Things</em>), demand for high-speed wireless service is only expected to increase. Wireless carriers will have to continue to innovate, and that means the cellular infrastructure of today may not look much like that of tomorrow.</p>

<h2>Keep an Eye Out</h2>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">During major events like sports games and concerts, the demand on a cellular network can far exceed its capacity. Also, disasters and emergencies can disrupt existing communication networks when they’re needed most. Mobile cell sites allow for on-demand expansion of cellular networks to add capacity or temporarily expand service into new areas. Affectionately known as <em>COWs</em> (for “cell site on wheels”), these truck- or trailer-mounted towers can be rented for deployment at a moment’s notice. Look for telescoping towers attached to a trailer or truck at the next major event you attend, and be thankful for cell service when you want to access your mobile ticket or send a video of the event.</p>

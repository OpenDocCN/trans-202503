- en: One concept I hope has come through in this book is that there are many ways
    to skin a MySQL cat. There’s plenty of room for creativity in designing and developing
    databases. You can use your knowledge of MySQL to build highly customized systems
    for your particular needs and interests, from your favorite baseball statistics
    to your startup’s customer list to a massive web-facing database of corporate
    takeovers.

- en: To dig deeper into MySQL development, you can load public datasets of interest
    into your own MySQL database. Websites like [https://data.gov](https://data.gov)
    and [https://www.kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com) contain data that’s free
    to use. (Remember to check the terms of the particular datasets you’d like to
    work with, however.) See if you can load datasets from different sources into
    MySQL tables and join them in a way that produces new or interesting insights.

- en: As Samsung and other manufacturers started selling their own Android-based devices
    worldwide, the uptick in sales that started with the Droid increased dramatically
    and continuously.

- en: When the Droid launched, in late 2009, Android was comfortably at the bottom
    of the heap of smartphone platforms. By the end of 2010, just over one year later,
    Android devices were outselling all of them except Nokia’s Symbian OS, and they
    passed Symbian as well in the following year.

    phones*,^([1](#c47-footnote-1)) the traditional low-end (and larger) portion of
    the mobile market, and many people chose Android smartphones.

    computers, the numbers get even more interesting. Fulfilling one of the points
    that the early Android startup team made in their pitch deck,^([4](#c47-footnote-4))
    sales of Android devices have outstripped PCs since 2011 and have beaten them
    by more than four times since 2015.^([5](#c47-footnote-5))

- en: This comparison seems, at first, perplexing; PCs (desktops and laptops of all
    makes and models) have been a requirement of modern life for decades. But many
    people in the world consider a PC as a luxury item, not a necessity; the first
    computing device they purchase is a smartphone. Smartphones, unlike PCs, have
    become *essential*; they satisfy that sweet spot of filling a need that people
    have (for communication, navigation, entertainment, business, or whatever) while
    being affordable enough that people who could not previously justify purchasing
    a computer could buy in to the smartphone world. They are also personal in a way
    that the “personal computer” never was; PCs tend to be shared equipment in a household,
    whereas most smartphones are used by only one person, which makes the potential
    market for these devices much larger than the market for PCs ever could be.

    three billion active Android devices^([6](#c47-footnote-6)) throughout the world.^([7](#c47-footnote-7))

<div class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><em>Signal generators</em>, also called waveform generators or function generators, create an alternating current (AC) voltage that can be used in a variety of electronic tests and diagnostic procedures. A <em>square-wave generator</em> like the one you will build in this chapter (shown in <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09fig9-1">Figure 9-1</a>) is an electronic lab instrument that creates a continuous sequence of equally spaced pulses of electricity that are on for a certain amount of time, switch off for an equal duration, and switch back on again, repeatedly.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="h3" id="ch09lev1sec1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_256"/><strong>Why Build a Square-Wave Generator?</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindentb">Signal generators like this one are frequently used to perform diagnostic jobs, from evaluating the frequency response of components and subsystems to providing stimulus to systems under development. Some specific uses for signal generators include:</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• Observing the integrity of an amplifier, attenuator, or other device</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• Measuring timing characteristics of a circuit</p>&#13;
<p class="bullb">• Simulating real-world on/off events</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The signal generator part of this project is primarily a square-wave generator.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch09lev2sec1"><em><strong>What Is a Square Wave?</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">What’s a square wave and what’s it good for, you ask? A <em>square wave</em> is an electrical signal that starts at zero voltage, rises to some level (its <em>amplitude</em>), stays at that level for some duration, returns to zero, and then repeats the process in a symmetric pattern.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The square wave is one of the fundamental wave forms in electronics, and it is in many respects the most useful, in part because it has both a DC component and an AC component. The DC component is the fact that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_257"/>it stays at a certain voltage for a period of time and then almost instantaneously transitions to a different level. The AC component is that it repeats this transition at a regular period. <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09fig9-2">Figure 9-2</a> shows a square wave.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/fig9_2.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap" id="ch09fig9-2"><em>Figure 9-2: A typical square wave</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The square wave has an amplitude and a period. The <em>period</em> of the wave is the duration of a complete cycle, and it could be in seconds, minutes, milliseconds, microseconds, and so on. The <em>frequency</em> is how many cycles occur in a certain period of time (one second is the accepted standard) and is therefore the reciprocal of the period. For a period of <em>T</em>, the formula to determine the frequency is <em>f</em> = 1/<em>T</em>.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch09lev2sec2"><em><strong>Why Square Waves Are Useful</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Square waves are particularly useful when developing and testing electronic products. For example, the clock in a microcontroller system is essentially a square wave. In some diagnostic and test procedures, the microcontroller’s internal clock can be disconnected and replaced by an external signal generated by a signal generator—in this case, a square wave or sine wave work equally well. You can then test the microcontroller at different frequencies. For certain processors, it’s often valuable to slow a processor clock during testing to see exactly where software glitches occur.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Other uses include sending a signal into a device being tested in order to tune the circuit to the proper value or checking a device’s frequency response or integrity. A square-wave generator can also act as a pulse generator to test a variety of digital circuits. You will find this application useful in the Ballistic Chronograph in <a href="ch08.xhtml#ch08">Chapter 8</a>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Because a square wave’s voltage starts at zero and rises almost instantly, it can also be used as a switching voltage to turn circuits off and on at the frequency of the square wave. The frequency of the Square-Wave Generator in this chapter ranges from 1 kHz to around 30 MHz (with the divider switch included, it can go down to 100 Hz). This frequency range can be varied via a potentiometer, so you can turn things on and off at different rates. This allows the Square-Wave Generator to simulate almost any repetitive switching action, which is useful for cycling things on and off for life-test applications, too.</p>&#13;
<div class="sidebar">&#13;
<p class="stitle"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_258"/><strong>OTHER USEFUL WAVEFORMS</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A square wave is only one common type of waveform, though. Probably the most common is the <em>sine wave</em>, or sinusoidal wave, in which the wave is a continuous curve and one cycle represents 360 degrees. Yet another wave type frequently encountered in electronics is the triangle wave. Both are depicted in <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09fig9-3">Figure 9-3</a>. The amplitude and period of a sine wave and a triangle wave are measured the same way as for a square wave.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/fig9_3.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap" id="ch09fig9-3"><em>Figure 9-3: A sine wave (top) and a triangle wave (bottom)</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Each of these waveforms has specific characteristics that make them useful in different applications. Sine waves and triangle waves are both important in electronic music projects, for example. This project, however, focuses on the square wave, and as you progress through this chapter, you will see it can be applied in a variety of ways.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch09lev2sec3"><em><strong>A Frequency Counter</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In addition to providing a signal generator, this project includes a <em>frequency counter</em>, which reads wave frequencies, so you can display the generator’s output frequency on a digital readout. You can also use the frequency counter as a separate instrument on its own to measure frequency from an outside source and display it. This project also displays the period, or impulse time, of the wave.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_259"/>In operation, the frequency counter receives an AC input signal and counts each pulse. After a certain number of pulses have been counted, the counter compares this against a clock signal, sometimes referred to as a <em>time base</em>, and displays the number of pulses per unit time—for example, pulses or cycles per second.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To assure accuracy, the counter compares the pulses against a clock, usually one that is crystal-based. For instruments that require the utmost accuracy, the crystal-clock assembly is a precision subsystem often placed in a temperature-controlled environment. The frequency counter in this project uses the 16 MHz crystal on the Arduino Pro Mini. In fact, the Pro Mini has most of the circuitry to implement a complete frequency counter with few additional components. It includes the clock registers for counting and just about everything else a frequency counter needs with no external components.</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="bgblack">NOTE</span></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>Professional laboratory and desktop instruments selling for hundreds (or thousands) of dollars often provide a very wide frequency range, from under 1 Hz to several GHz, and offer anywhere from 6- to 10-digit precision. Their displays can be switched to read frequency or time (the time between pulses), too</em>.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">To do all of this, the Square-Wave Generator takes advantage of the Arduino AT328 16 MHz, 5V Pro Mini, which is a smaller, lower-priced version of the Arduino Nano. The generator also includes special circuitry to divide a signal’s frequency, allowing you to provide an output of very low frequencies at one end and allowing the frequency counter to read very high frequencies—above what the Pro Mini can normally handle—at the other.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch09lev1sec2"><strong>Shortcomings of the Square-Wave Generator</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">While this project produces a square-wave generator and a frequency counter that perform well in many applications, it has shortcomings compared with professional laboratory and bench instruments. The generator has a less than 1 percent frequency error, which is good for hobby projects but doesn’t match the tolerances of laboratory-grade and direct-digital-synthesizer (DDS) generator units. Those units often have errors measured in the part-per million (PPM) range. And the frequency counter uses the time base of the Arduino, which, while accurate, doesn’t match higher-priced units with crystal ovens and other special circuitry.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This generator also doesn’t offer the resolution of multiple digits. Many lab and bench instruments have resolutions that go into as many as 10 digits. That said, the instrument has worked well for me in a broad variety of Arduino and other projects, where a greater resolution wasn’t required.</p>&#13;

The banana jacks have only one conductor each.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="h3" id="ch09lev1sec6"><strong>The Schematic</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The Square-Wave Generator circuit in <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09fig9-7">Figure 9-7</a> doesn’t call for a lot of different components. However, before you start building, note that the Arduino Pro Mini has a very different pin configuration than the Nano. It is also worth noting that there are many versions of the Pro Mini available, so check the pinout of the version you buy. The particular Arduino I suggest in the parts list has the pinout detailed in <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09fig9-4">Figure 9-4</a>. Read “<a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09lev1sec7">Important Notes on the Pro Mini</a>” on <a href="ch09.xhtml#page_263">page 263</a> for a description of key differences.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the schematic, notice the switches: SW1, SW2, SW3, and SW4. SW2 provides the divide-by-10 display. SW3 allows you to use the frequency counter with an external source instead of the signal generator. SW1 connects the 1, 10, 100 divider for the master clock (the switch has a center-off position that doesn’t have a connection) for the LTC1799 oscillator. SW4 is the power switch; its center is off, and the other two positions are for either external supply or battery.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="h3" id="ch09lev1sec7"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_263"/><strong>Important Notes on the Pro Mini</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Before you build the breadboard, note that one major pinout difference among Pro Mini boards is the placement of pins A4, A5, A6, and A7. Some versions locate all four analog inputs on the short side of the board, while the Deek-Robot used in this project splits them (see <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09fig9-8">Figure 9-8</a>). It places A4 and A5 near the other analog pins, but not in line with them, and A6 and A7 are on the short side of the board. Pins A4 and A5 are used to drive the I<sup>2</sup>C bus for the display.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">There are some other minor differences between the Pro Mini and the Arduino Nano, but one of the most prominent is that the Pro Mini does not include a USB interface, so you have to program it using an external serial interface of some kind. There are several serial adapters on the market using FTDI technology. (<em>FTDI</em> is an abbreviation for <em>Future Technology Devices International</em>, a privately held Scottish semiconductor device company specializing in USB technology.)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">An alternative to using FTDI-based, purpose-built serial adapters is to use another microprocessor board to program the Pro Mini. I use an Arduino Uno clone to program my Pro Mini because it’s inexpensive, it allows me to remove the processor chip so I don’t end up programming <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_264"/>both boards, and it’s easy to use. I use a simple breadboard setup to do the programming. Go to “<a href="ch00.xhtml#ch00lev1sec3">Uploading Sketches to Your Arduino</a>” on <a href="ch00.xhtml#page_5">page 5</a> for connection details.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="h3" id="ch09lev1sec8"><strong>How the Square-Wave Generator Was Developed</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This project was developed to solve a need that emerged when creating the Ballistic Chronograph in <a href="ch08.xhtml#ch08">Chapter 8</a>. While developing the chronograph, I needed some way to test it to assure it worked properly without using a weapon with live ammunition and shooting holes in my shop.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The Square-Wave Generator was my solution to the problem. With it and a small handful of other parts, I was able to simulate the signal the chronograph should receive as a projectile breaks a sequence of light beams. I decided to start with the time it took a projectile to travel an arbitrary distance of 3 inches, which turned out to be somewhere between 50 and 1,000 microseconds, depending on the speed of the projectile. I then used the Square-Wave Generator to generate a signal at frequencies between 20,000 Hz and 1,000 Hz, the reciprocals of those times. Once I figured out what I needed for the chronograph, the Square-Wave Generator project took on a life of its own, and the final version is what you see in this chapter.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch09lev2sec4"><em><strong>Deciding How to Generate Signals</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_265"/>First, I looked for an easy way to satisfy my timing requirements. There were several DDS (direct digital synthesis) products and boards that would have easily solved the problem, but all of the solutions I found were a little pricier than I was hoping, and many had other shortcomings. Abandoning the DDS, I looked at several alternatives, some bringing me back to my old Radio Amateur days. One solution was to use a crystal oscillator and divide a fundamental frequency to achieve frequencies near the ones I needed. This presented several problems, not the least of which being that the circuit would likely need several divider chips.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Another solution was to create my own variable frequency oscillator (VFO) from scratch. While a possibility, that solution entailed more design work than I was prepared to do at the time, so I went back to the data sheets.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I found that Linear Technology’s LTC1799 single-chip precision oscillator had just about what the doctor ordered—and more. According to the data sheet, this chip provides a square-wave signal from 1 KHz to 33 MHz with a single variable resistor and a switch to divide the fundamental oscillator frequency by 1, 10, or 100. It boasts good stability, too: nominally, it has less than 1 percent error. And it was a lot less pricey than the DDS solutions at just under $4.00.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The final part of the problem was to see what frequency the generator was creating. Without an external frequency counter or a calibrated oscilloscope, it would be extremely difficult to get even a close approximation of the frequency generated. So the project mushroomed to include a built-in frequency counter. Because the counter was there anyway, I included a switch to allow me to use the frequency counter as a stand-alone instrument.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch09lev2sec5"><em><strong>Planning How to Display the Frequency</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Now I could generate square waves, but there were still some other problems to be addressed. For example, how would I read the frequency from the outside? I could mark the potentiometer positions with calibrations—as many generators of yore have done—but that is at best a clumsy and inaccurate approach in today’s digital age. A built-in frequency counter and bright display seemed most practical.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I went back to the drawing board—and to the Arduino Library. I found several approaches to Arduino frequency counters online, including at least two separate frequency counter libraries. The simplest and most convenient library for this application was <em>FreqCount.h</em>, developed by Paul Stoffregen. How I used this library is discussed more under “<a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01lev1sec8">The Sketch</a>” on <a href="ch09.xhtml#page_271">page 271</a>. For more information on the library itself or to get the latest updates, you can go to <em><a href="https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/FreqCount/">https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/FreqCount/</a></em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A preliminary breadboard prototype indicated that the frequency counter worked well. I put the breadboard together using a 20×4 LCD <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_266"/>display using the I<sup>2</sup>C interconnect. After labeling the display with the word <em>Frequency</em> and displaying the frequency in Hz under that, I still had two lines of 20 characters left (see <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09fig9-9">Figure 9-9</a>).</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/fig9_9.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap" id="ch09fig9-9"><em>Figure 9-9: The display of the Square-Wave Generator, showing the frequency and the impulse time</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Waste not, I always say. Because at least two of the projects I planned to use the Square-Wave Generator with required evenly spaced pulses (more or less a pulse generator), I decided to use the second two lines of the display to indicate the time of the impulse. Calculating the time in the sketch would be relatively easy, as the time (in seconds) is a function of the frequency (<em>T</em> = 1/<em>f</em>).</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch09lev1sec9"><strong>Signal Integrity</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Without getting involved with the higher math of signal composition, a square wave can be thought of as an infinite series of sine wave harmonics added together. As the frequency increases, so does the complexity and fragility of the waveform. If you connect your breadboard circuit to an oscilloscope, you can observe this yourself.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This project was initially developed as a square-wave generator/frequency counter that could operate in the area of 1,000 Hz to 1 MHz. This generator does its job with panache, but the fundamental oscillator chip has a range far in excess of that.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In developing the project, I had two options. The first was to intentionally limit the device’s performance to the area that was initially proposed or to extend it closer to the limits of the oscillator and suffer some degradation at the higher end. I selected the latter. While the square wave starts rounding off at around 15 MHz or so, the performance at the lower—and intended—frequencies is not impacted whatsoever. <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09fig9-10">Figure 9-10</a> shows four oscilloscope traces at different frequencies to demonstrate.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">At 1 kHz, the wave pattern is close to perfect, as you can see from the display on my older analog oscilloscope (see <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09fig9-10">Figure 9-10A</a>). In <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09fig9-10">Figure 9-10B</a>, at 5 MHz, the edges of the square wave are compromised a very small amount, showing a slight overshoot on the rising edge. When the frequency <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_267"/>is increased to 12 MHz, the signal begins to look a little ragged, with even more distortion (see <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09fig9-10">Figure 9-10C</a>). Some of the distortions of the wave are a result of tuning, or stray capacitive and inductive effects, by certain components used in the construction. This is an avoidable phenomenon, and I mention it primarily so you’re aware of the shape of the waveform. I suspect that most of your applications for the generator will be in the lower-frequency area, at less than 1 MHz, where the wave pattern produced is as good as it gets. Further, I have used the generator in higher frequencies, and the slightly distorted waveform had virtually no effect on the result.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/fig9_10.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap" id="ch09fig9-10"><em>Figure 9-10: Four oscilloscope traces showing the output of the Square-Wave Generator at 1 kHz (A), 5 MHz (B), 12 MHz (C), and 20 MHz (D). It quickly becomes apparent that the square-wave signal starts to lose integrity at around 12 MHz</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">While the waves continue to distort at frequencies above 20 MHz (see <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09fig9-10">Figure 9-10D</a>), they are fully recognizable as square waves and remain useful. At 30 MHz—the extent of the range of the Square-Wave Generator as built—the signal trace looks increasingly like a sine wave, but for most test purposes, it is still totally valid.</p>&#13;
<div class="sidebar">&#13;
<p class="stitle"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_268"/><strong>LISTENING TO SQUARE WAVES</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">An interesting experiment that will provide you with some idea of the harmonics present in a square wave is to set the Square-Wave Generator to the audible range of the frequency spectrum and plug its output into the input of an amplifier and loudspeaker. Listen to the quality of the sound. The “fuzz” you hear is a result of rich harmonics produced by the square wave, which essentially comprises a composite of all other sine waves within the frequency limit.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch09lev1sec10"><strong>Fine-tuning with a Decade Counter</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In designing the system, there were a couple final additions I settled on to add utility and improve performance. The frequency counter, as put together, had a frequency range of about 100 Hz to around 10 MHz tops. The LTC1799 oscillator offered a frequency range from 1 kHz to about 30 MHz, and for most applications, that would be far more than adequate. But there were some applications I had in mind that would need an AC source down to about 100 Hz.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Well, there turned out to be a way to kill both birds, so to speak, with one chip: a divide-by-10 counter—in this case, an HCT4017 or CD4017 decade counter and a couple of switches.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The decade counter accepts an AC signal, counts to 10, and then starts over. By looking at one of the counter outputs, it essentially divides by 10.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">It was possible to feed the output of the oscillator through the divide-by-10 counter and show output frequency on the LCD, while the actual output frequency would be 10 times the frequency shown. This workaround lets the Square-Wave Generator show frequencies well above 10 MHz on the LCD as long as you can mentally move the decimal point over one place. On the flip side, the switch (SW2) could be moved to take the output of the oscillator divided by 10 directly so that it could output a minimum output frequency as low as 100 Hz, or 1 kHz/10.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch09lev1sec11"><strong>The Oscillator in Detail</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The oscillator part of this project is pretty much self-contained in the LTC1799 and requires only an external variable resistor, a bypass capacitor, and a switch used to divide the fundamental oscillator frequency by 1, 10, or 100 times. The value that the frequency is divided by depends on what you’re connecting to pin 4. When you connect pin 4, or the DIV pin, of the LTC1799 to GND, the frequency is divided by 1; when pin 4 is left floating or open, the frequency is divided by 10; and when pin 4 is connected to 5V, the frequency is divided by 100. This allows the unit to cover a range of frequencies from 1 kHz to 30 MHz.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_269"/>Also, while I have chosen to use a 250-kilohm potentiometer between pins 1 and 3 of the LTC1799, any potentiometer between 3 kilohms and 1 megaohm is acceptable. The frequency decreases as this resistor value increases, and vice versa.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">According to the manufacturer, the LTC1799 outputs a fairly crisp square wave throughout its frequency range. As frequencies increase, however, there are a variety of considerations that impact the integrity of the wave. These include stray capacitances and inductances due to the layout of the circuit, such as the output position, the hookup of the variable potentiometer, the switch, and other components. Because most applications I had in mind were in the lower end of the frequency spectrum offered by the LTC1799, I did not pay strict attention to the layout and thus probably have somewhat compromised integrity at the higher frequencies. See <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09fig9-10">Figure 9-10</a> for actual signal traces.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch09lev1sec12"><strong>The Breadboard</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">As in virtually all of my Arduino projects, somewhere during the design process, I end up making a breadboard layout. <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09fig9-11">Figure 9-11</a> shows the prototype for the Square-Wave Generator.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/fig9_11.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap" id="ch09fig9-11"><em>Figure 9-11: The breadboard for the Square-Wave Generator</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Wiring the breadboards for testing posed no difficulty, with the exception that the oscillator became a little squirrely at the higher frequencies when using longer interconnect leads.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_270"/>Here are the connections:</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li><p class="order">Connect all of the red positive rails together and blue negative rails together. Be careful not to connect the red and blue rails under any circumstances.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="order">Insert the LTC1799 oscillator module as close as possible to one end of the breadboard. See the far left-hand side of <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09fig9-11">Figure 9-11</a>. The oscillator has to be mounted on an adapter board so it will fit in the 0.100 centers of the breadboard, as shown in <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09fig9-12">Figure 9-12</a>.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="order">Insert the Arduino Pro Mini into the breadboard. Connect the 5V terminal of the Pro Mini to the red positive rails of the breadboard.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="order">Connect the GND of the Pro Mini to the blue negative rails.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="order">Insert the HCT4017 decade counter into the breadboard. (It’s immediately to the left of the LCD in <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09fig9-11">Figure 9-11</a>.)</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="order">Insert the LTC1799 on its adapter board into the breadboard.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="order">Connect one end of the three-position (center-off) switch SW1 to ground. Connect the other end to VCC, and connect the center pin of the switch to pin 4 of the LTC1799.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="order">Connect one end of switch SW2 to pin 6 of the LTC1799 adapter board (or pin 5 of the LTC1799).</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="order">Connect one end of the potentiometer R1 to pin 3 of the LTC1799. Connect pin 1 of the LTC1799 to the red positive rail along with the other side of the potentiometer and the wiper, or the center pin of the potentiometer.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="order1">Pin 6 of the LTC1799 will be the output of the oscillator, which will go to pin 14 of the HCT4017 and to one leg of switch SW2.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="order1">Capacitor C1 should have been installed on the adapter board as described.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="order1">Connect pins 13 and 15 of the HCT4017 to ground.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="order1">Connect the other end of switch SW2 to pin 12 of the HCT4017 (CD4017).</p>&#13;

<p class="figcap" id="ch09fig9-12"><em>Figure 9-12: The SOIC has been soldered to an adaptor board, which will fit into the 0.100-inch centers of the breadboard. The chip includes only 5 pins, but I used a 6-pin adapter</em>.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="order1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_271"/>Connect the center of switch SW2 to an empty row on the breadboard. (I used one between the Pro Mini and the HCT4017).</p></li>&#13;

<li><p class="order1">Pin 3 of switch SW3 will serve as the input if you use the breadboard in the frequency-counter-only mode.</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="bgblack">NOTE</span></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>SW4, the AC/battery on/off switch, does not need to be configured in the breadboard, as the circuit can receive power from the computer while programming the Arduino. The LM7805 is not used in the breadboard configuration for the same reason</em>.</p>&#13;
</div></li>&#13;
<li><p class="order1">Check your LCD. If it includes the I<sup>2</sup>C subassembly board soldered to it, you’re okay to continue. Otherwise, solder the I<sup>2</sup>C board to the display as described in “<a href="ch00.xhtml#ch00lev1sec2">Affixing the I<sup>2</sup>C Board to the LCD</a>” on <a href="ch00.xhtml#page_3">page 3</a>.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="order1">When your LCD is ready, you will need four male-to-female connector wires to hook it up. (In the finished version, you can make a small wire harness for it, including wires for VCC, GND, SCL, and SDA.) I usually color code these with red and black for positive and ground, green for SCL, and yellow for SDA. Plug the VCC wire into the red positive rail, the negative into the blue negative rail, SDA to A4 on the Pro Mini, and SCL to A5 on the Pro Mini.</p></li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<p class="indent">Finally, build your programming circuit or plug in your FTDI adapter, load the sketch onto the Pro Mini, and you’re all set to go.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch09lev1sec13"><strong>The Sketch</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The Square-Wave Generator sketch simplified somewhat as I iterated on the project. The result is a mercifully compact program, thanks to the integration of the LTC1799 and the <em>FreqCount.h</em> library (available from the Library Manager section of the Arduino IDE).</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><br/>/* Square Wave Generator Sketch. Gives a proper reading with multiplier.  <br/> * Parts of this sketch are derived from Paul Stoffregen's public domain  <br/> * example code.  <br/> */ <br/>#include &lt;FreqCount.h&gt;<br/>#include &lt;LiquidCrystal_I2C.h&gt; <br/>#include &lt;Wire.h&gt; <br/><br/>unsigned long freq = 0; <br/>float impulse; <br/><br/>LiquidCrystal_I2C lcd(0x27,20,4);<br/><br/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_272"/><br/>void setup() {<br/>  lcd.init();<br/>  lcd.backlight();<br/>  FreqCount.begin(1000);  <br/>} <br/><br/>void loop() {<br/>  if(FreqCount.available()) {<br/>    freq = FreqCount.read();<br/>    lcd.clear();<br/>    lcd.setCursor(1,0);<br/>    lcd.print(" Frequency");<br/>    lcd.setCursor(0, 1);<br/>    lcd.print(freq);<br/>    lcd.setCursor(10, 1);<br/>    lcd.print("Hz");<br/>    lcd.setCursor(0, 2);<br/>    lcd.print("Impulse");<br/>    lcd.setCursor(0,3);<br/><br/>  <br/>    impulse = ((1/(float)freq)* 1000000);<br/>    lcd.print(impulse);  <br/>    lcd.print("  uS  ");<br/>  } <br/>} <br/></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The sketch starts by including three libraries: <em>FreqCount.h</em> for the frequency counter and two others for working with the LCD. To add <em>FreqCount.h</em> to your Arduino IDE, go to <strong>Sketch <span class="ent">▸</span> Include Library <span class="ent">▸</span> Manage Libraries…</strong> and install the FreqCount library from the Library Manager. The <span class="literal">setup()</span> section prepares the LCD and starts the frequency counter. The <span class="literal">loop()</span> section fetches the frequency, calculates the impulse width, and displays both.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The Arduino doesn’t actually have anything to do with generating the signal—that’s all done at the oscillator and subsequently in the divider. The Arduino’s function is to look at the signal and read out the frequency.</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="bgblack">NOTE</span></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>Although pin 5 on the Arduino is connected to the LTC1799 oscillator, I do not set it as an analog input in this sketch. That is apparently taken care of in the FreqCount library. See “Frequency Input Pin” at</em> <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_FreqCount.html">https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_FreqCount.html</a> <em>for various Arduino models. Incidentally, using this library renders analog pins 3, 9, 10, and 11 unusable as analog outputs (PWM)</em>.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch09lev1sec14"><strong>The Shield</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">For this project, I developed a small PCB shield to hold the various components. Although the shield could probably have been designed to use only a single layer, I elected to use a two-layer board. First, it greatly reduced layout time, and second, because I was producing another two-layer board at the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_273"/>same time, I could expose and etch them both at once with little additional effort. (It’s more efficient to etch multiple boards simultaneously, when you can.) <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09fig9-13">Figure 9-13</a> shows the top and bottom foil patterns of the shield.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/fig9_13.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap" id="ch09fig9-13"><em>Figure 9-13: Top (left) and bottom (right) foil pattern for the Square-Wave Generator’s PCB shield</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Assembling the components on the shield requires special attention to the bypass capacitor. The shorter the leads of the 0.1 μF capacitor from pin 1 of the LTC1799 oscillator to ground, the better the oscillator works. I actually soldered the capacitor directly to the chip-mounting board.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09fig9-13">Figure 9-13</a> shows the component placement on the shield. Notice that the HCT4017 (CD 4017)is located beneath the Pro Mini; the PCB was designed this way to conserve space and hold high-frequency traces to a minimum length.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As in other projects, it’s necessary to populate the headers for the Pro Mini only where they actually connect to the board, in addition to a header at pin 1 to simplify aligning the Pro Mini on the shield. The LM7805 voltage regulator requires no heat sink.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch09lev1sec15"><strong>Construction</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="indent">Building the Square-Wave Generator was relatively straightforward, but note that I did not take particular care with wiring the leads for switch SW1, which provided the divider for the oscillator, or with the placing and wiring of the potentiometer. Shortening these wires—and perhaps adjusting the placement of the parts themselves—probably would have improved the integrity of the waveform somewhat at higher frequencies. <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09fig9-14">Figure 9-14</a> shows the inside of my Square-Wave Generator; if you look carefully, you can see my hand-scribbled notations as to where things are located.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_274"/><img alt="image" src="../images/fig9_14.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap" id="ch09fig9-14"><em>Figure 9-14: Everything fit easily in the slope-panel enclosure. The LCD was held in place with four screws, and the shield was mounted on top of the LCD with double-sided foam adhesive. The switches, I/O jacks, and potentiometer were soldered by hand</em>.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch09lev2sec6"><em><strong>Preparing the Enclosure</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindentb">First, mark the front of the enclosure for the following holes:</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• Two to aid in cutting out the space for the LCD</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• Four for mounting holes for the LCD</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• Four for the banana jacks</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• Four for the switches</p>&#13;
<p class="bullb">• One for the potentiometer</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you’re using the Hammond 1595C sloped-front enclosure I recommend in “<a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01lev1sec2">Parts List</a>” on <a href="ch09.xhtml#page_260">page 260</a> or an equivalent, you can follow the template in <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09fig9-15">Figure 9-15</a>. Just locate the PDF of the drawing in this book’s resource files, print it out, lay it over the front of the enclosure, and carefully center punch for the holes. I also use a fine-tip Sharpie marker to indicate locations and to draw on the enclosure. Excess marker can be easily cleaned with isopropyl alcohol.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09fig9-16">Figure 9-16</a> shows how to use the radius of the enclosure to determine the measurement for the display.</p>&#13;

<p class="figcap" id="ch09fig9-16"><em>Figure 9-16: The LCD is placed using the radius of the enclosure</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_276"/>I drilled the holes in the following order:</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li><p class="order">Carefully drill 1/2-inch holes at the corners of the cutout for the LCD. If you mark the centers of the holes correctly, the edge of the display will be tangential to the outer diameter of the hole. You can then draw lines connecting the edges of the holes to use as a guide to cut out the display.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="order">Cut out the display using a keyhole saw or saber saw. The enclosure is made of a relatively soft ABS plastic, so you should have no difficulty making the cut.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="order">Clean debris from the cutout with a file if necessary, and check that the display fits.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="order">Drill the four mounting holes (labeled A in <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09fig9-15">Figure 9-15</a>) for the display.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="order">Drill four 5/16-inch holes for the banana jacks (labeled B).</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="order">Drill four 1/4-inch holes for the switches (labeled C). It’s a good idea to identify the switch locations with a permanent marker on the inside of the enclosure to simplify wiring them.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="order">Drill a 9/32-inch hole for the potentiometer (labeled D).</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="order">Locate a position you like for the 3.5 mm power jack that is 3/4 inches from the edge of the enclosure and 1/2 inches from the bottom. Drill a 1/4-inch hole for a 3.5 mm jack there.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="order">Mount the LCD with four 4-40 screws. Some LCDs have a protrusion on one side for the backlight. If yours does, you will have to raise the LCD off the surface of the enclosure to accommodate the backlight section on the right-hand edge (when looking at the LCD with the connections at the top). I simply put 4-40 nuts on the back of the screws to leave space. If a single nut is not enough (4-40 nuts can have different thicknesses), include a washer. Then, fasten the display to the enclosure. If your display does not include the protrusion, then just fasten the display to the case.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="order1">Mount the banana plug jacks and switches in the enclosure. It is sometimes easier to solder wires onto the switches and jacks to minimize damage to the enclosure from accidental contact with the soldering iron.</p></li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch09lev2sec7"><em><strong>Wiring the Electronics</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Before mounting the PCB shield in the enclosure, solder the components to it, and solder all the wires for the LCD, the potentiometer, the switches, the power jack, and the banana jacks. You may find it helpful to solder the wires to the switches and jacks first. When in doubt, leave some extra length on the wires, but abide by the axiom, “If it’s too short, you can always splice it; if it’s too long, you won’t know what to do with it.” I suggest using male and female headers for the LCD to make hookup easier.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I mounted the shield directly to the rear of the LCD using double-sided foam tape. This, however, could have contributed to the distortion of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_277"/>waveform at higher frequencies. You might prefer to mount the module as far from the display as possible. The front of the enclosure needs no special treatment other than the placement of the labels at your discretion.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch09lev1sec16"><strong>Design Notes and Mods</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">I toyed with several iterations of the Square-Wave Generator before arriving at the version described in this chapter. Along the way, I tweaked some aspects and considered other changes. While the ideas in this section didn’t make it into this project, you may enjoy trying them yourself.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch09lev2sec8"><em><strong>Displaying Frequency in Other Units</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The sketch displays the square-wave frequency in Hz, as most of the applications I have planned are in the area of 100 Hz to 10 kHz. But if you find yourself using the device a lot in higher frequencies, looking at six or seven integers can be confusing. Never fear: it’s easily possible to change the sketch to show the frequency in kHz or even MHz by simply truncating the display.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To truncate the display, simply add a comma and the number of digits you want it to show. For example, to change from Hz to kHz, change these lines in the sketch:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs1">lcd.print(freq);<br/>lcd.setCursor(10, 1);<br/>lcd.print("Hz");</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">to these lines:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs1">lcd.print(freq/1000);<br/>lcd.setCursor(10, 1);<br/>lcd.print("kHz");</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you want to reduce the number of digits appearing in the readout, change this line:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs1">lcd.print(freq/1000);</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">to this:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs1">lcd.print(freq/1000,3);</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can change <span class="literal">3</span> to the number of digits you want.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch09lev2sec9"><em><strong>Reading External Input Frequencies</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The schematic and the finished project include a switch to change from generating pulses to reading the frequency of an external input. The switch (SW3) brings the input jack directly to the input (pin 5) of the Arduino, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_278"/>where the oscillator would normally connect. I have used this very successfully for a variety of applications, particularly when I wanted a quick frequency reading somewhere outside my shop.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">There is no circuitry to protect the processor, so just be careful. The unit is meant to use inputs that are standard TTL levels—0 to 5V. The Arduino is relatively sensitive and can detect signals at somewhat lower levels. If you plan, however, to use it with very low-level inputs—that is, less than 0.5V—then you should build some kind of prescaler or preamp circuit.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you plan to use the Square-Wave Generator as an independent frequency counter, you might want to consider using a preamp to provide the amplification and prevent damage to the processor. A simple one appears in <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09fig9-17">Figure 9-17</a>, using one-sixth of a 74HC14 Hex Schmitt-trigger inverter.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/fig9_17.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap" id="ch09fig9-17"><em>Figure 9-17: Optional preamp/buffer for input to frequency counter</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Using a preamp will help protect the input of the Arduino because the output of the preamp will be limited to the supply voltage.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch09lev2sec10"><em><strong>Battery Power</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">While this project was initially designed for use with an external power supply, it can be easily converted to battery power. The total current drain with the LCD backlight lit is just under 100 mA. The capacity of a zinc manganese battery is approximately 500 mA hours. Thus, you can expect a life of about 5 hours. Alkaline batteries will tend to do better.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To accommodate the battery power, I simply replaced the power switch with one that had a center-off position. I wired one outer terminal to the AC-based power jack, the other outer terminal to the positive terminal of the battery, and the center terminal to the positive rail on the PCB shield. The negative terminal of the battery goes to ground. That configuration is shown in the current schematic. If you use the enclosure I suggest, a battery should fit conveniently. You can use double-sided adhesive to attach a battery holder.</p>&#13;

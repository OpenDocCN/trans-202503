<p class="PO"><a href="part2.xhtml">Part II</a> will walk you through four separate applications as we teach you how to utilize the most common components and go over the most important concepts of Dash. You will also learn about several popular graphs from the Plotly graphing library as we explain how to visualize a variety of datasets. You will create an app that analyzes social media data, an app that retrieves data in real time, an app that explores how asset allocation affects the returns of an investment portfolio, and an app that visualizes machine learning models. At the end, we will provide you with tips and tricks that will make learning Dash and building your own apps even easier and more enjoyable.</p>

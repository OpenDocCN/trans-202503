<p class="chapterintro">A book about bat files? Why? Didn’t the Aztecs use Batch? Isn’t it the Betamax of scripting languages? You should be writing a book about a newer, sexier coding language instead of a Model T repair manual.</p>
<p class="tx">I wish that I could dismiss out of hand such protestations as simply the negativism of nattering nabobs, but this is a sentiment I feel compelled to address. Batch isn’t new, and the lack of some functionality is mystifying by today’s standards, but it’s still an immensely useful language that isn’t going away anytime soon, especially since it’s being packaged with the operating system installed on every Windows computer. While Batch is one scripting language among many, there are still many lines of Batch code being supported by large and small companies, and some tasks truly lend themselves to bat files more than any other language. And as for that lacking functionality—booleans, arrays, hash tables, stacks, even object-oriented design, and more—I’ll show you how to build it yourselves by the end of this book.</p>
<p class="tx">But the most immediate reason for me personally to write a book about Batch scripting is that after two decades of writing bat files for personal <span aria-label=" Page xxvi. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xxvi" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and professional use, I believe that I’ve gotten to a place where I’ve learned enough about the topic to share my experiences and insights with a larger community. For many moons, I coded at a company that ran large-scale processes on Windows servers, all of them driven by bat files. Others might have gone with a more modern scripting language, but a coder who preceded me had mastered the art of bat files to such an extent that an alternative to Batch was never seriously considered. I played the understudy role of Robin until his retirement, when I was unofficially elevated to Batman.</p>
<p class="tx">Writing Batch code is still an important skill for any coder and even noncoders, but much of the existing documentation is sparse, scattered, and sometimes inaccurate. More so than in other languages, a great deal of experience and experimentation is required to gain proficiency, and I have a unique perspective to share. That’s why I wrote this book.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="sec1" epub:type="division">
<h2 class="h" id="sec1"><span id="h1-1"/><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">This Book’s Audience</span></h2>
<p class="tni">This book is not for beginners, nor is it for experts; it’s for <i class="calibre6">both</i>. I actually hope to reach three groups of people. The first is coders who write, maintain, or otherwise work with bat files on a near daily basis. The second is all other coders who work on a Windows machine, and the third is noncoders who also work on a Windows computer.</p>
<p class="tx">The first group, those working closely with Batch, are on the list for obvious reasons. This book is the culmination of two decades of my intense and immersive work in Batch scripting. By the end of this book, you’ll have explored several complex concepts, such as creating commands, data structures, operators, and even a coding paradigm that weren’t envisioned by the language’s creators. I’ll work steadily up to that complexity, but I hope that in these pages you’ll find everything you need to master the language and the tools to further explore what little isn’t here.</p>
<p class="tx">If you’re in the second group, you likely don’t maintain thousands of lines of Batch code, but on a Windows computer you write code in other languages, and you should be at least moderately versed in Batch. This skill allows you to perform some common and repetitive tasks by running a simple (or maybe not so simple) bat file. Animating code written in other languages has its challenges, one of which is that your machine’s environment is different from the eventual production environment where the program will execute. To this end, I’ll show you how to mimic or simulate another computer’s environment with a few lines of Batch code. By the end of this book, I’m sure that you’ll find that a bat file is a solution for many issues.</p>
<p class="tx">Even noncoders, the final group, can benefit from some Batch code to minimize repetitive tasks such as moving files, merging reports, or connecting to network drives to make Windows Explorer easier to use. Since coding isn’t in your job description, your employer is unlikely to load the infrastructure for other coding languages onto your computer so that you can perform relatively simple coding tasks, but everything you need to write and execute a bat file is already on your workstation. The skill set needed <span aria-label=" Page xxvii. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xxvii" role="doc-pagebreak"/>to write a bat file is the ability to create a text file, rename it, and type a few lines into it. And if you can double-click a file, you can run a bat file. That’s all you’ll need (other than this book).</p>

<h2 class="h" id="sec2"><span id="h1-2"/><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">How to Read This Book</span></h2>
<p class="tni">Every author, regardless of the genre, envisions their readers sitting by a fire, sipping sherry (or for me a good barleywine, not too sweet), hanging on every word, reading, processing, and reading some more until the book is complete. Well ... this is a technical book, so a significant subset of my readers will be coders sitting in front of a computer trying to figure out why their damn bat file isn’t doing what they want it to do. I’ve been there and fully appreciate the dilemma, and to aid you, I’ve organized this book with headings, subheadings, a detailed table of contents, and an index. You can find the section and page that will answer your question, and you can jump right to it, but that isn’t the ideal way to read this or any book.</p>
<p class="tx">I’ve structured this book into short and concise chapters. Even if you’re trying to solve a particular problem, I recommend reading the pertinent chapter in its entirety, because each one is a bit like a lesson plan. (My day job is coding, but I am trained as a mathematician and have spent more than two decades teaching various math classes at Manchester Community College in Connecticut.)</p>
<p class="tx">A typical lesson starts with the basic concept, followed by some simple examples. Then I delve into the complexity of the topic, show uses for the concept, and even explain typical stumbling blocks to avoid. Not every lesson (or chapter) follows that arc, but many do. If you have a question about, say, how to copy a file, I recommend reading <span class="xref"><a href="chapter7.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 7</a></span> from beginning to end. Skipping to the middle of the chapter is analogous to coming into class 20 minutes late.</p>
<p class="tx">I also recommend executing on your own some of the coding examples that I present. Most of the code snippets are quite short and easy to type in, and you can grab the longer ones from the online version of this book. Better yet, modify the code, explore the results, and make it your own.</p>

<div class="calibre9"/><h2 class="h" id="sec3"><span id="h1-3"/><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">How This Book Is Structured</span></h2>
<p class="tni">Batch is unique in that one single command, the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">for</span> command, predominates all others to a massive extent, and I’ve organized this book into three parts, centered around that all-important command. <span class="xref"><a href="part1.xhtml" class="calibre3">Part I</a></span> is titled “The Essentials,” and it deals with the topics you’ll need leading up to the discussion of the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">for</span> command. The first part includes these chapters:</p>
<p class="runinpara"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter1.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 1</a>: Batch</b>    This chapter introduces you to the Batch scripting language as you build what may be your first-ever bat file. I include editing tips, and since Batch is an interpreted language, I discuss the role and importance of the interpreter.</p>
<p class="runinpara1"><span aria-label=" Page xxviii. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xxviii" role="doc-pagebreak"/><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter2.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 2</a>: Variables and Values</b>    This chapter is about defining variables and interrogating their values either for display to the console or for any other use.</p>
<p class="runinpara1"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter3.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 3</a>: Scope and Delayed Expansion</b>    After you learn how to define where variables can be accessed in a bat file, I’ll introduce one of the most intriguing features of Batch, delayed expansion, which impacts how you resolve variables.</p>
<p class="runinpara1"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter4.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 4</a>: Conditional Execution</b>    The <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">if...else</span> construct is a basic feature of most languages, and Batch is no different. You’ll learn how to execute or not execute certain bits of code based on various conditional clauses.</p>
<p class="runinpara1"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter5.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 5</a>: String and Boolean Data Types</b>    This chapter tackles the tasks of building and concatenating strings, extracting a substring from a larger string, and replacing certain text in a string. I also introduce the first of many tools not intrinsic to Batch that we’ll build, namely, booleans or variables that evaluate to either true or false.</p>
<p class="runinpara1"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter6.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 6</a>: Integer and Float Data Types</b>    You’ll learn all the intricacies of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing integers. This chapter also details modulo division as well as octal and hexadecimal arithmetic. I then delve into another data type not intrinsic to Batch: floating-point numbers.</p>
<p class="runinpara1"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter7.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 7</a>: Working with Files</b>    This chapter handles many of the tasks concerning files, such as copying, moving, deleting, and renaming them, and even creating an empty file.</p>
<p class="runinpara1"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter8.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 8</a>: Executing Compiled Programs</b>    This chapter explores how to call a program with and without a defined path and, in particular, how the interpreter finds your program when you don’t provide a path.</p>
<p class="runinpara1"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter9.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 9</a>: Labels and Nonsequential Execution</b>    This chapter introduces labels and the role they play in allowing you to direct the code’s execution to prior or later commands in a bat file, sometimes even initiating a loop.</p>
<p class="runinpara1"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter10.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 10</a>: Calling Routines and Bat Files</b>    Expanding on the previous chapter, you’ll learn all that’s involved in creating callable routines within a bat file and how to invoke one bat file from another.</p>
<p class="runinpara1"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter11.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 11</a>: Parameters and Arguments</b>    Invoking other code is often of little use if you can’t pass arguments to the called code and it can’t pass parameters back to you. This chapter delves into all the intricacies of the process, even unearthing the hidden parameter.</p>
<p class="runinpara1"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter12.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 12</a>: Outputs, Redirection, and Piping</b>    After differentiating between outputs created by the coder and the interpreter, I discuss how to redirect both to either the console or a file, which leads nicely to the technique of piping the output of one command into another and its uses.</p>
<p class="runinpara1"><span aria-label=" Page xxix. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xxix" role="doc-pagebreak"/><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter13.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 13</a>: Working with Directories</b>    This chapter details how to create and delete directories and how to retrieve a great deal of information about a directory and its contents. I also demonstrate techniques for mapping local and network directories to drive letters.</p>
<p class="runinpara1"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter14.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 14</a>: Escaping</b>    If you want to use a certain character in a string, you’ll run into issues if it’s a special character having some defined function in Batch. This chapter details the sometimes surprisingly involved solutions to that problem.</p>
<p class="runinpara1"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter15.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 15</a>: Interactive Batch</b>    In this chapter you’ll build a fully functional Batch user interface that accepts freeform text from the console and allows the user to select one item from a list, among other features.</p>
<p class="runinpara2"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter16.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 16</a>: Code Blocks</b>    Code blocks are more than just blocks of code. This chapter explores how and why variables in a code block can possess two distinct values. I’ll even introduce the naked code block and explain its significance.</p>
<p class="tx"><span class="xref"><a href="part2.xhtml" class="calibre3">Part II</a></span> is simply titled “The for Command,” and as its name more than suggests, it explores the aforementioned <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">for</span> command, which opens up a large batch (pun intended) of functionality. You’ll find these topics:</p>
<p class="runinpara"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter17.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 17</a>: Fundamentals of the for Command</b>    This chapter details the functionality of the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">for</span> command without introducing any of its options, which is still highly impressive. It creates loops processing any number of input files or text strings, and with the use of modifiers, you’ll be able to determine almost everything about a file, other than its contents.</p>
<p class="runinpara1"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter18.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 18</a>: Directories, Recursion, and Iterative Loops</b>    This chapter explores some options of the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">for</span> command that allow for even more functionality. With one option, the command enumerates through a list of directories instead of filenames. With another, you can recursively process through directories and subdirectories, for instance, searching a folder and all of its subfolders for a file fitting a mask. Another option turns the command into an iterative loop, incrementing or decrementing an index with every pass.</p>
<p class="runinpara1"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter19.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 19</a>: Reading Files and Other Inputs</b>    One last option turbocharges the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">for</span> command, allowing you to read files. This chapter spares no details about how to parse or reformat each record of a file as you read it. In addition to a traditional file, the command can also read and process ordinary text, either hardcoded or from a variable, and it can even take the output of another command and read it as if it were a file.</p>
<p class="runinpara2"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter20.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 20</a>: Advanced for Techniques</b>    This chapter delves into some impressive applications of the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">for</span> command, such as embedding commands of another language (for example, PowerShell and Python) into your Batch script. I also discuss some techniques for working around limitations of the command.</p>
<p class="tx"><span aria-label=" Page xxx. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xxx" role="doc-pagebreak"/>“Advanced Topics” is the title of <span class="xref"><a href="part3.xhtml" class="calibre3">Part III</a></span>, which discusses various and varied topics, particularly everything that I couldn’t address before having the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">for</span> command in my toolkit. Here’s the breakdown:</p>
<p class="runinpara"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter21.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 21</a>: Pseudo-Environment Variables</b>    This chapter details pseudo-environment variables, or special variables not always under your control. For instance, Batch has specific variables that hold the date, the time, and the return code of both Batch commands and called programs. I also explain how to safely set some of these variables and share the difference between bat and cmd files.</p>
<p class="runinpara1"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter22.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 22</a>: Writing Reports</b>    This chapter explains how to format rudimentary text file reports with Batch, complete with header, detail, and trailer records.</p>
<p class="runinpara1"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter23.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 23</a>: Recursion</b>    Some problems lend themselves nicely to the technique of recursion, which is the methodology where code invokes itself. This chapter demonstrates how to do this in Batch with detailed and interesting examples.</p>
<p class="runinpara1"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter24.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 24</a>: Text String Searches</b>    This chapter explores many permutations of text string searches. Search files, variables, or hardcoded text for one or more words or literal strings. You’ll even find a couple of examples that use regular expressions.</p>
<p class="runinpara1"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter25.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 25</a>: Bat Files Building Bat Files</b>    This chapter details the intricacies involved in one bat file building a second fully functional bat file with dynamic and static code, while also contemplating what Archimedes would have done with Batch.</p>
<p class="runinpara1"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter26.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 26</a>: Automatic Restarts and Multithreading</b>    After discussing how to automatically restart a failed process, this chapter uses a bat-file-building bat file to automatically kill and restart a hung process. I also discuss executing multiple threads or concurrencies at once under the direction of a single bat file.</p>
<p class="runinpara1"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter27.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 27</a>: and/or Operators</b>    It might sound like a basic topic, but Batch possesses neither the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">and</span> nor the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">or</span> operator. This chapter builds techniques that mimic these operators for various situations.</p>
<p class="runinpara1"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter28.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 28</a>: Compact Conditional Execution</b>    This chapter details a compact and funky construct that looks and acts a lot like the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">if...else</span> construct. I discuss when best to use each after examining the subtle yet significant differences between the two.</p>
<p class="runinpara1"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter29.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 29</a>: Arrays and Hash Tables</b>    These data structures aren’t intrinsic to Batch, but you’ll learn how to populate and retrieve data from both arrays and hash tables.</p>
<p class="runinpara1"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter30.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 30</a>: Odds and Ends</b>    This chapter covers a few disparate topics: file attributes, bit manipulation, querying the Windows Registry, and sorting the contents of a file.</p>
<p class="runinpara1"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter31.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 31</a>: Troubleshooting Tips and Testing Techniques</b>    I share many tips and techniques for developing and testing bat files that I’ve picked up over the years.</p>
<p class="runinpara1"><span aria-label=" Page xxxi. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xxxi" role="doc-pagebreak"/><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter32.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 32</a>: Object-Oriented Design</b>    As crazy as it might sound, this chapter delivers the capstone of user-built bat file functionality. I explain the four pillars of object-oriented design before walking through a model that implements them as completely as possible. I hope that seasoned coders find this chapter informative and entertaining.</p>
<p class="runinpara2"><b class="calibre10"><a href="chapter33.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 33</a>: Stacks, Queues, and Real-World Objects</b>    This chapter applies the just-learned principles of object-oriented design to build objects implementing the stack and queue data structures.</p>
<p class="tx">For each chapter in the first and third parts, I set out to discuss a narrow topic or how to perform a specific task; I don’t set out to discuss a specific command, but I’ll often introduce one or more commands in a chapter. For each command, I’ll explain its function, show you its syntax, and detail its features that I find most useful.</p>
<p class="tx">It’s my goal that if you’re a noncoder, you’ll find at least the first two parts readable and informative. Read much further and you might just become a coder.</p>

<h2 class="h" id="sec4"><span id="h1-4"/><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">Other Resources</span></h2>
<p class="tni">If you’re looking for comprehensive and straightforward explanations of individual Batch commands, go no further than <i class="calibre6"><a href="https://ss64.com/nt/" class="calibre3">https://<wbr/>ss64<wbr/>.com<wbr/>/nt<wbr/>/</a></i>. It’s a great and well-organized resource, and I referenced it extensively while writing this book. This book isn’t a list of commands; it’s a discussion about how to solve problems with those commands. I usually present the options of a command that I find to be the most useful, but you’ll find the full list at this site.</p>
<p class="tx">In the (hopefully) rare event that you can’t find a solution in these pages, the next best alternative is to tap into the online nerd community. Searching the web for your issue and “bat file” (in quotes) should produce several results. Of the many online forums, I’ve consistently found the best ideas and suggestions at <i class="calibre6"><a href="https://stackoverflow.com" class="calibre3">https://<wbr/>stackoverflow<wbr/>.com</a></i>.</p>

<section aria-labelledby="sec5" epub:type="division">
<h2 class="h" id="sec5"><span id="h1-5"/><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">Notes on Style</span></h2>
<p class="tni">Most technical books and manuals are dry reads, and I’ve made every effort to buck that trend. First and foremost, I haven’t lost sight of the fact that my primary mission is to explain the technical material that I’m trying to impart. But, for instance, when discussing the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">sort</span> command, I don’t want to sort the likes of <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">Apples</span> and <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">Bananas</span>; it’s much more fun to sort the captains of the starship <i class="calibre6">Enterprise</i> from <i class="calibre6">Star Trek</i>, or at least I think it is. I use a Mad Libs game when discussing parameters, passing different parts of speech as arguments. The chapter on interactive Batch shares bat (or maybe bad) jokes with the user.</p>
<p class="tx">Not every chapter lends itself to entertaining examples or a humorous anecdote, but I’ve made every effort to avoid files containing <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">Record 1</span> <span aria-label=" Page xxxii. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xxxii" role="doc-pagebreak"/>as the first record or a string of pipe-delimited fields defined as <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">field 1| field 2|field 3</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">Ideally, I hope to elicit an audible chuckle; I’d be thrilled with a smirk and a nod; and I’d even be happy with an eyeroll and a groan. Boring be damned. I live by the mantra “It’s better to be uniquely bad than average.” (I wish that I could take credit for this quote, but many years ago our guide on a tour of Benziger Winery in Sonoma County, California, used it to describe the winery’s philosophy.)</p>

<section aria-labelledby="sec6" epub:type="division">
<h2 class="h" id="sec6"><span id="h1-6"/><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">Batveats</span></h2>
<p class="tni">In my experience, Batch has many significant caveats in comparison to other languages. In the pages ahead, I’ll often follow seemingly definitive statements about syntax or usage with the word <i class="calibre6">except</i>. (For instance, “The ampersand character terminates a command, <i class="calibre6">except</i> when followed by a second ampersand or ...”) The English language is unique in that much of its syntax has caveats that just don’t exist in other languages—think “<i class="calibre6">i</i> before <i class="calibre6">e</i> except after <i class="calibre6">c</i>.” Maybe this makes Batch the quintessentially patriotic American language (or maybe British).</p>
<p class="tx">These <i class="calibre6">batch caveats</i> are so prevalent that I’ve taken to calling each one a <i class="calibre6">batveat</i> (pronounced bat-v<span class="copyright_accent">ē</span>-<span class="copyright_accent">ä</span>t, trademark pending). They can be very frustrating for unguided new users, but as these chapters unfold, I’ll point out the various batveats that have bitten me in the past so that you can ideally avoid the pain.</p>

<h2 class="h" id="sec7"><span id="h1-7"/><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">Woody Guthrie</span></h2>
<p class="tni">The epigraph that I chose for this book is a relatively well-known quote from the legendary artist Woody Guthrie, but I was hesitant to use it for fear of how it might be interpreted. The intent of the quote isn’t egotistical, it’s aspirational. Woody traveled the United States espousing economic justice while also preaching about the evils of racism and sexism. He didn’t do this with dry, boring speeches, but with a guitar and perceptive lyrics that still resonate long after his early death.</p>
<p class="tx">Woody Guthrie was trying to bend the arc of history in the direction of social justice, while I’m trying to make an esoteric programming language a little more attainable with prose that is informative, readable, and entertaining. It is my hope that I can contribute to the understanding of a complex topic, and I can only aspire to Woody’s sublime example.</p>

<section aria-labelledby="sec8" epub:type="division">
<h2 class="h" id="sec8"><span id="h1-8"/><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">For the Love of Batch</span></h2>
<p class="tni">Never, never invite more than one Batch coder to a party. One is fine. If we’re there without a compatriot, we’ll talk about sports, politics, books, movies, and travel like anyone else. But when you put at least two of us together anywhere, you’ll hear things like “I recently found a new way to <span aria-label=" Page xxxiii. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xxxiii" role="doc-pagebreak"/>code an <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">or</span> operator in the conditional clause of an <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">if</span> command. Would you like me to share it with you?” We will kill your party.</p>
<p class="tx">The optimist will say that Batch is <i class="calibre6">esoteric</i>, while the pessimist will say it is <i class="calibre6">cryptic</i>. The truth is probably somewhere in between, and you’ll find both of these words often in this book. The syntax is distinct from most languages, and the lack of certain functionality makes for imaginative solutions to problems that would be uninteresting in other languages. The upshot is a couple of people sucking the oxygen out of your Super Bowl party with a discussion about different ways to construct a hash table.</p>
<p class="tx">I find these puzzles invigorating, and that’s a major reason why I enjoy scripting in Batch, while others may find it a chore. Sometimes I really enjoy coding in a language that makes the implementation of a stack a significant accomplishment. To briefly demonstrate just one challenge, the character for the at symbol (@) can be a variable name, and extracting the second-to-last character from its value requires the syntax <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">%@:~-2,1%</span>. That might look more like a curse word in a comic strip than code, and admittedly it does look esoteric, maybe even cryptic, but please don’t put this book down out of fear; I promise that it will make perfect sense after just a few chapters.</p>
<p class="tx">Being a Batch expert in a room full of coders only moderately versed in the discipline can feel like being a Sumerian priest—one out of a select group of people who can interpret a script and impart its meaning and wisdom to others. But I hold my position not due to a random birthright, and I do not guard the ability to decipher this cuneiform from others out of self-interest. With this book I hope to make high priests and priestesses out of all who want to learn this not-so-ancient script. In the pages to follow, I’ll be more than honest concerning issues and frustrations that I’ve found with the language, but I do love coding bat files, and by the time you’ve finished reading this book, I hope that I’ve made a convert out of you.</p>

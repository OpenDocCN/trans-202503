  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book was inspired by our experience working with seniors. We’ve been teaching
    computer skills to seniors for a combined 30 years and have created our own Seniors
    IT program dedicated to helping seniors learn how to use computers in a simple
    way and with easy activities. Over the years, we’ve been asked many times to turn
    our famous Seniors IT classes into a book so people can learn when and where they
    want. Well, here we are!

- en: '*Computers for Seniors* will teach you to use your computer in the same lesson-by-lesson
    format we teach to seniors in our classrooms. That means we’ll cover only the
    truly useful features that other seniors have requested, used, and loved. This
    book provides step-by-step instructions and full-color pictures to make things
    as easy to follow as possible. No dry reading here! We hope this book will help
    you learn the things you truly want to know about your computer.'

- en: You’ll need a computer device with Windows 10 and an internet connection. Your
    computer might be a desktop computer, a laptop, or a tablet of any brand—and any
    version of Windows 10 will work perfectly fine! If you’re upgrading to Windows
    10 from an older version, like Windows 7 or Windows 8, this book is also for you.

    sort of computer to buy, how to set up Windows 10, and how to connect to the internet.

    A laptop or tablet computer will have these built in, but if you have a desktop,
    you might need to buy them separately.

    on the previous one. For example, you’ll need to learn to put photos on your computer
    before you learn to send photos via email!

    should aim to complete those activities. There are solutions at the back of the
    book if you get stuck or would like some guidance (see “[Solutions](app04.xhtml#app04)”
    on [page 305](app04.xhtml#page_305)). A couple of lessons and activities will
    ask you to work with a friend or family member to do things like making and receiving
    Skype calls. If you can’t find anyone to help you at that moment, feel free to
    leave the activity and come back to it later.

    details have changed between the time this book was printed and when it reached
    your hands. For example, the screenshots might look slightly different from what
    you see onscreen, or a button might have a different name or color. Regardless,
    you should still be able to identify what you need from the images provided.

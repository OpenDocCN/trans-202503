  zh: 关于本书
- en: This book was inspired by our experience working with seniors. We’ve been teaching
    computer skills to seniors for a combined 30 years and have created our own Seniors
    IT program dedicated to helping seniors learn how to use computers in a simple
    way and with easy activities. Over the years, we’ve been asked many times to turn
    our famous Seniors IT classes into a book so people can learn when and where they
    want. Well, here we are!

  zh: 本书的灵感来源于我们与老年人一起工作的经验。我们已经为老年人教授电脑技能30年，创建了我们自己的“老年人IT”项目，专门帮助老年人以简单的方式学习如何使用电脑，并通过轻松的活动进行学习。多年来，我们多次收到请求，希望将我们著名的“老年人IT”课程变成一本书，以便人们在任何时间和地点学习。现在，我们做到了！
- en: '*Computers for Seniors* will teach you to use your computer in the same lesson-by-lesson
    format we teach to seniors in our classrooms. That means we’ll cover only the
    truly useful features that other seniors have requested, used, and loved. This
    book provides step-by-step instructions and full-color pictures to make things
    as easy to follow as possible. No dry reading here! We hope this book will help
    you learn the things you truly want to know about your computer.'

    book if you get stuck or would like some guidance (see “[Solutions](app04.xhtml#app04)”
    on [page 305](app04.xhtml#page_305)). A couple of lessons and activities will
    ask you to work with a friend or family member to do things like making and receiving
    Skype calls. If you can’t find anyone to help you at that moment, feel free to
    leave the activity and come back to it later.

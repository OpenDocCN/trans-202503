<p class="COS">On a Saturday morning in late October 2018 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Robert Bowers posted a message to the fascist-friendly social network Gab. “[Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society] likes to bring invaders in that kill our people,” he wrote. “I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in.” He was parroting the “great replacement” conspiracy theory, popularized in the US by former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, which claims that Jews are replacing white people with immigrants of color.</p>

<p class="TX">Armed with an AR-15 assault rifle and three Glock semi-automatic pistols, Bowers entered the Tree of Life Synagogue, where three different Jewish congregations were holding Shabbat services that morning, and <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_348" aria-label=" Page 348. "/>committed the deadliest antisemitic terrorist attack in US history. He killed 11 people and wounded 6 others, including several Holocaust survivors.</p>

<p class="TX">That day, several companies kicked Gab off their platforms. GoDaddy, the registrar that Gab used to buy the domain gab.com, sent Gab a letter saying it had “discovered numerous instances of content on your site that both promotes and encourages violence against people.” Gab was down only for a few days, though, thanks in part to the domain name registrar and web hosting company Epik, which soon took over registration for gab.com.</p>

<p class="TX">In this chapter, you’ll learn about Epik, its extremist customers, and the 2021 data breach that exposed hundreds of gigabytes of customer data. You’ll download and learn to work with some of the leaked data, most of which is in the format of structured query language, or SQL (often pronounced “sequel”). SQL is a popular database technology that many websites, online services, and local software use to store data. This chapter focuses on MySQL databases, which use the SQL software that Epik uses. You’ll also practice using database software called MariaDB, a community-maintained version of MySQL. Finally, you’ll learn to run a SQL server (software that allows you to host SQL databases), import the data, and write your own code to search it, skills that will prepare you for investigating your own SQL datasets in the future.</p>

<h3 class="H1" id="sec1"><span id="h-294"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">The Structure of SQL Databases</samp></h3>

<p class="TNI">I have briefly discussed SQL databases in previous chapters, including <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a></span>, where you converted CSVs into SQLite databases for BlueLeaks Explorer. There are many types of SQL databases, including PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle SQL, and the aforementioned MySQL and SQLite. While they’re all based on SQL, they have minor differences that mean they’re not entirely compatible with each other. SQL databases are popular; therefore, so are SQL data breaches.</p>

<p class="TX">Some SQL database software is proprietary. For example, Microsoft SQL Server is the version of SQL that Microsoft products require, and it runs only on Windows. Oracle is another proprietary version of SQL; if you get a leaked Oracle database, you’ll need to use Oracle software to access it. PostgreSQL and MySQL are free and open source and run on Linux servers, making them popular and widely used in web development. SQLite is another free and open source version of SQL. It can’t handle huge databases, but it’s very simple and convenient for small ones—iPhone and Android apps frequently store their settings in a SQLite database, for example.</p>

<p class="NOTE-TXT"><i>Some datasets may require you to set up a SQL database server that you’re unfamiliar with, or figure out how to convert them into a type of SQL you already know, in order to analyze them. I once contributed to an investigation based on a leaked Chinese police database that revealed the suffocating surveillance of China’s Uyghur minority group in the Xinjiang region. It was an Oracle database, but it’s unclear whether the Chinese police paid for it or were pirating it. Because Oracle is proprietary and</i> <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_349" aria-label=" Page 349.

<p class="TX">Next we’ll look at what relational databases are, how SQL servers typically work, and the terminology used to describe SQL databases and the data they contain.</p>

<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec2">

<h4 class="H2" id="sec2"><span id="h-295"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Relational Databases</samp></h4>

<p class="TNI">SQL databases are made up of tables, which you can think of as spreadsheets comprising a list of rows, with each row containing the same columns, or <i>fields</i>. SQL databases are useful because they’re <i>relational</i>, meaning that data in different tables can relate to each other. You saw this firsthand when working with BlueLeaks Explorer: the BlueLeaks folders had individual spreadsheets like <i>Documents.csv</i> and <i>DocumentCategory.csv</i>, but once you converted them into SQLite databases, you could rely on the relationship between the Documents and the DocumentCategory tables to browse BlueLeaks documents by category.</p>

<p class="TX">Let’s look at a simple example: a database that contains two related tables for books and authors. <a href="#tab12-1">Table 12-1</a> shows the information stored in the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">authors</samp> table.</p>

<p class="TX">Each SQL database can contain multiple tables, and each table has a defined set of fields. For example, <a href="#tab12-2">Table 12-2</a> has <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">id</samp>, <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">title</samp>, and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">author_id</samp> fields.</p>

<p class="TX">Every table in a SQL database normally has a unique <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">id</samp> field that <i>auto-increments</i>, meaning that when you add rows of data to the table, the first row is automatically given an <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">id</samp> of 1, the second is given an <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">id</samp> of 2, and so on, ensuring that no two rows ever have the same <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">id</samp>. If <a href="#tab12-1">Table 12-1</a> included two authors named Micah Lee, it would be clear in the database that they’re not the same person, because the ID for each row would be different.</p>

<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_350" aria-label=" Page 350. "/>In general, tables relate to each other using these unique ID numbers. Let’s say you’re browsing through the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">books</samp> table and come across <i>Contact: A Novel</i>. Who wrote it? According to the data in its row, the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">author_id</samp> is <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">2</samp>. To find out who the author is, you’d look at the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">authors</samp> table for the row with the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">id</samp> of <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">2</samp> to find that it’s Carl Sagan.</p>

<p class="TX">This example deals with a small amount of data, but SQL databases can become huge and complicated. For example, instead of two authors, you might find a database with 10 million users and all sorts of tables that relate to it using a field called <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">user_id</samp>.</p>

<h4 class="H2" id="sec3"><span id="h-296"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Clients and Servers</samp></h4>

<p class="TNI">Most types of SQL databases are <i>server</i> software, meaning you install a SQL server to hold all of the data. Other computers then use a SQL <i>client</i> to communicate with that server to search for, add, or update data. This communication is similar to how websites work: a web server has the software that runs the website, while a web browser (the client) connects to the server remotely to load web pages, submit forms, and so on. SQL clients communicate to servers using SQL queries, also known as <i>statements</i>. Similarly to English, SQL queries start with a <i>verb</i> that describes an action being taken and have <i>clauses</i> that further describe that action. All SQL queries end with semicolons (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">;</samp>).</p>

<p class="TX">Each SQL server can host multiple databases. For example, you could run 20 different WordPress websites on the same MySQL server by having each website use a different database. The Epik dataset includes data from nine different MySQL databases. If you downloaded them all, you could import all nine into the same MySQL server. Because much of the Epik data is in MySQL format, in Exercise 12-1 you’ll run a MySQL server in Docker. Once you have a server running, you’ll connect to it later using a client to import the data and begin your analysis.</p>

<p class="TX">In this chapter, you’ll try out two different MySQL clients: the web-based client Adminer and the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">mysql</samp> command line client, which allows you to interact with the database from the terminal. For MySQL, Adminer is more user-friendly for manually browsing a SQL database, but <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">mysql</samp> is especially useful for working on remote servers and creating or restoring database backups. For a simpler introduction to working with clients, you’ll use Adminer in the first half of this chapter, then move on to the command line client. All clients interact with servers in the same way, sending SQL queries to the SQL server, which runs them and returns a response. Therefore, the skills you learn using Adminer will also apply to the CLI client.</p>

<p class="TX">SQL servers also normally have a system of users and permissions that allow you to grant a given user access to some databases but not others. The root user on MySQL and other databases has total access to every database on the server. When you’re researching a leaked database, it’s fine to run all of your searches as the root user since you’re typically the only person using that server. However, if you’re running a database that strangers online might use, such as a website powered by a SQL database, you should use non-root database users with restricted permissions. This way, if one of those strangers hacks your database, they’ll have access only to what that specific database user has permissions for.</p>

<p class="TNI">You can store only a single type of data in each column in a SQL table. For example, you can store strings, but not numerals, in the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">title</samp> column of <a href="#tab12-2">Table 12-2</a> (though you could get around this by storing a string representation of a number, like the string <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">'1'</samp> instead of the number <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">1</samp>).</p>

<p class="TX">Data types differ slightly depending on the flavor of SQL you’re using. However, you’ll generally see types representing numbers, times, or strings of text. The following list includes some common SQL types that are all valid in MySQL:</p>

<p class="RunInPara"><samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W7Bold_B_11">INT</samp> Integers or whole numbers</p>

<p class="RunInPara"><samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W7Bold_B_11">DECIMAL</samp> Numbers with decimal places</p>

<p class="RunInPara"><samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W7Bold_B_11">DATE</samp> A specific date</p>

<p class="RunInPara"><samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W7Bold_B_11">DATETIME</samp> A specific date, along with the time of day</p>

<p class="RunInPara"><samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W7Bold_B_11">VARCHAR</samp> A string of characters of a specified length</p>

<p class="RunInPara"><samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W7Bold_B_11">TEXT</samp> Also a string of text</p>

<p class="TX">If <a href="#tab12-2">Table 12-2</a> were stored in a MySQL database, <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">id</samp> would be type <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">INT</samp>, <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">title</samp> would be type <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">TEXT</samp>, and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">author_id</samp> would be type <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">INT</samp>. If you tried storing the string <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">"hola"</samp> in the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">author_id</samp> field, the SQL server would respond with an error message, because the data isn’t an integer.</p>

<h5 class="BH" id="box-6"><samp class="SANS_Dogma_OT_Bold_B_11">THE HISTORY OF MARIADB</samp></h5>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">MySQL was first released in 1995 as open source SQL database software maintained by the Swedish company MySQL AB. For nearly two decades it reigned as the most popular database for web apps, ushering in the early internet’s Web 2.0 era. Wildly popular web app software like WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and MediaWiki (which powers Wikipedia) were all built on MySQL databases and developed in the PHP programming language.</samp></p>

<p class="BoxBody"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">In 2008, Sun Microsystems acquired MySQL AB, and with it the MySQL software. In 2009, Oracle announced that it was acquiring Sun Microsystems. The MySQL community had many concerns about the future of the project in Oracle’s hands, including that it would cease to be open source. In response, the database’s original creator, Michael “Monty” Widenius, forked MySQL into a new version, MariaDB, that would remain open forever. (</samp><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Forking</samp> <samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">an open source project means starting a whole new open source project that’s based on the code of an existing project.) Many of the original MySQL developers stopped working on MySQL and moved to the MariaDB project.</samp></p>

<p class="BoxBody"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">MariaDB is completely compatible with MySQL, and you can seamlessly switch between the two database servers and clients.

However, since MariaDB is completely compatible with MySQL, it’s common to use the terms interchangeably. I’ll refer to both as MySQL for the remainder of the chapter, except when referring to specific MariaDB software packages.</samp></p>

<p class="BoxBodyLast"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">When Widenius originally created MySQL, he named it after his daughter, My. When he forked MySQL into MariaDB in 2009, he named the new project after his youngest daughter, Maria.</samp></p>

<p class="TX">The simplest way to run a MariaDB server on your computer is by using Docker containers, like you did in Exercise 5-3 when you set up a local WordPress website as practice using Docker Compose.

<p class="TNI">In this exercise, you’ll learn the syntax of SQL queries. You’ll be using MySQL, but the syntax is nearly identical to that of all other types of SQL, so this section should give you a solid foundation for writing SQL queries in general. You’ll learn the different verbs and practice running SQL queries to add, update, delete, and most importantly, search the data in SQL databases.</p>

<p class="TX">Make sure that your Docker containers from Exercise 12-1 are up, then load Adminer in your web browser at <i>http://<wbr/>localhost:8080</i>. Also make sure you’ve logged in to your MySQL server as the root user, using the same password from the previous exercise. When you’re ready, click the <b>books</b> database to begin.</p>

<p class="TNI">So far the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">books</samp> database you created in Exercise 12-1 includes the tables <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">authors</samp> and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">books</samp>, but those tables don’t have any rows.</p>

<p class="TX">To add new rows to your tables, you use the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">INSERT</samp> verb as follows:</p>

<pre id="pre-497"><code>INSERT INTO <var>table_name</var> (<var>column1</var>, <var>column2</var>, <var>...</var>) VALUES (<var>value1</var>, <var>value2</var>, <var>...</var>);</code></pre>

<p class="TX">In Adminer, click the <b>SQL Command</b> link in the left sidebar. In the empty field that pops up, enter the following <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">INSERT</samp> queries:</p>

<pre id="pre-498"><code>INSERT INTO authors (name) VALUES ('Micah Lee');

INSERT INTO authors (name) VALUES ('Carl Sagan');

INSERT INTO books (title, author_id) VALUES ('Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations', 1);

INSERT INTO books (title, author_id) VALUES ('Pale Blue Dot', 2);

INSERT INTO books (title, author_id) VALUES ('Contact: A Novel', 2);</code></pre>

<p class="TX">These commands insert all of the rows into the two tables in the database, one row at a time. The first two lines insert rows into the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">authors</samp> table, just setting the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">name</samp> field, while the last three lines insert rows into the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">books</samp> table, setting the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">title</samp> and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">author_id</samp> fields. These <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">INSERT</samp> statements don’t specify <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">id</samp> values because the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">id</samp> field for both tables auto-increments, starting with <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">1</samp>.</p>

<p class="TX">While you don’t need to set the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">id</samp> field when inserting into the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">books</samp> table, you do need to set the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">author_id</samp> field manually, which is how you tell the database who the author of each book is. Since the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">authors</samp> table started out empty, the author row for <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Micah Lee</samp> should have an <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">id</samp> of <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">1</samp> (as it was the first row added to the table), and the row for <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Carl Sagan</samp> should have an <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">id</samp> of <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">2</samp>. When the code inserts the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations</samp> title, it sets <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">author"SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11"&gt;1</samp>, and when it inserts the two books by Carl Sagan, it sets <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">author_id</samp> to <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">2</samp>.</p>

<p class="TX">Similarly to Python <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">if</samp> statements, the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">WHERE</samp> clause also supports parentheses and Boolean logic operators <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">AND</samp> and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">OR</samp>, as well as the comparison <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_361" aria-label=" Page 361. "/>operators greater than (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&gt;</samp>), greater than or equal to (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&gt;=</samp>), less than (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;</samp>), and less than or equal to (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;=</samp>). For example, say you want to search for books with an <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">id</samp> between 10 and 100, including the number 10 but not the number 100. Try that out with the following query:</p>

<pre id="pre-507"><code>SELECT * FROM books WHERE id &gt;= 10 AND id &lt; 100;</code></pre>

<p class="TX">You can use the equals (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">=</samp>) operator to search for exact strings. For example, run the following command to find all of the authors with the name Carl Sagan:</p>

<pre id="pre-508"><code>SELECT * FROM authors WHERE name='Carl Sagan';</code></pre>

<p class="TX">This search is case sensitive, so while it would find authors named Carl Sagan, it wouldn’t find authors named CARL SAGAN or carl sagan. For a case-insensitive search, use the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">LIKE</samp> operator. Try running the following command:</p>

<pre id="pre-509"><code>SELECT * FROM authors WHERE name LIKE 'carl sagan';</code></pre>

<p class="TX">This command finds authors named Carl Sagan, CARL SAGAN, carl sagan, or any other capitalization.</p>

<p class="TX">The <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">LIKE</samp> operator supports the wildcard character, the percent sign (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">%</samp>), which will match any characters. Querying the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">authors</samp> table where <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">name LIKE '%lee%'</samp> will search for rows where <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">name</samp> contains any number of characters (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">%</samp>), followed by <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">lee</samp>, followed by any number of characters again (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">%</samp>). For example, to find all of the authors with Lee in their names, run:</p>

<pre id="pre-510"><code>SELECT * FROM authors WHERE name LIKE '%lee%';</code></pre>

<p class="TX">This query returns the row with the name <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Micah Lee</samp>, but it would also return Stan Lee, Lee Young-ae, and Andrea Leeds.</p>

<p class="TX">To search just for people with the last name Lee, run this query:</p>

<pre id="pre-511"><code>SELECT * FROM authors WHERE name LIKE '% lee';</code></pre>

<p class="TX">In this case, there’s only one wildcard character at the beginning of the string, followed by a space, followed by <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">lee</samp>. This query will return Stan Lee, since this name matches any number of characters, followed by a space, followed by <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">lee</samp>. However, it won’t return Lee Young-ae; this name matches any number of characters but has no space followed by <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">lee</samp>, and it contains extra characters after <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">lee</samp>.</p>

<p class="TX">Using logical operators, you can combine as many conditions as you want. For example, to look for books written by Carl Sagan that have the word <i>blue</i> in their titles, run this query:</p>

<pre id="pre-512"><code>SELECT * FROM books WHERE author_id=2 AND title LIKE '%blue%';</code></pre>

<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_362" aria-label=" Page 362. "/>You could expand on that query by running the following query to also check for books with <i>green</i> or <i>red</i> in their titles:</p>

<pre id="pre-513"><code>SELECT *

FROM books

WHERE

    author_id=2 AND

    (

        title LIKE '%red%' OR

        title LIKE '%green%' OR

        title LIKE '%blue%'

    );</code></pre>

<p class="TX">This query uses both the logical operators <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">AND</samp> and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">OR</samp>, as well as parentheses. When you run it, the SQL server will reject any rows where <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">author_id</samp> isn’t <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">2</samp> and where <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">title</samp> doesn’t contain at least one of the strings <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">red</samp>, <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">green</samp>, or <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">blue</samp>.</p>

<p class="TX">This final query has multiple lines, with some of them indented. As your queries get longer, using whitespace like this can make your SQL queries easier to read. In general, I tend to write short queries on a single line and split longer queries into multiple lines. You’ll continue indenting your queries in the following sections.</p>

<p class="TX">You should now have a basic understanding of how to select data from a table in a SQL database. In the next section, you’ll learn to select data from multiple tables at once.</p>

<h4 class="H2" id="sec16"><span id="h-305"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">JOIN Clauses</samp></h4>

<p class="TNI">Because SQL databases are relational, you can select data from and receive results from columns from multiple tables simultaneously using <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">JOIN</samp> clauses. You can think of these clauses as the SQL server combining (joining) multiple tables into a single table, then selecting rows from that combined table.</p>

<p class="TX">For example, say you want to write a single query that will return a table of book titles and their authors, relying on the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">title</samp> field in the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">books</samp> table and the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">name</samp> field in the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">authors</samp> table. Run the query in <a href="#list12-1">Listing 12-1</a> to select a table of results from columns in those two tables at once.</p>

<pre id="pre-514"><code>SELECT

<p class="TX">Since this query involves more than one table, you must specify the names of the columns you want to select in the format <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_Italic_I_11">table_name.column_name</samp>. The SQL query selects the book title with <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">books.title</samp> and the author name with <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">authors.name</samp>. The <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">FROM</samp> clause shows that this query is selecting <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_363" aria-label=" Page 363. "/><i>from</i> the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">books</samp> table and joining this table with the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">authors</samp> table. The <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">JOIN</samp> clause explains how the two tables are related: the SQL server knows that a <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">books</samp> row is related to an <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">authors</samp> row if the value of <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">books.author_id</samp> matches the value of <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">authors.id</samp>.</p>

<p class="TX">The SQL server responds with a single table of rows that contains fields from both tables, based on the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">books.author_id</samp> <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">=</samp> <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">authors.id</samp> relationship specified in the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">JOIN</samp> clause.</p>

<p class="TX">The type of join described in this section is technically called an <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">INNER JOIN</samp>, which is the default type of join in MySQL. In addition to <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">INNER</samp> joins, however, you can also use <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">LEFT</samp> and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">RIGHT</samp> joins.</p>

<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec17">

<h5 class="H3" id="sec17"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Using LEFT and RIGHT Joins</samp></h5>

<p class="TNI">There are two additional ways to join tables together in SQL: <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">LEFT JOIN</samp> and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">RIGHT JOIN</samp> queries. Each time you join two tables, the table from which you’re selecting is the “left” table (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">books</samp>, in the previous example). The table with which you’re joining is the “right” table (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">authors</samp>, in this case). <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">LEFT JOIN</samp> means that the combined table should contain all of the rows from the left <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_364" aria-label=" Page 364. "/>table, but not necessarily all of the rows from the right table. As you might guess, <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">RIGHT JOIN</samp> means that the combined table should contain all the rows in the right table, but not necessarily those from the left. Finally, as you saw in the previous section, <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">INNER JOIN</samp> means that the results should contain only rows where the relationship holds. That is, if there are any rows in the left table that don’t match any rows in the right table—and vice versa—based on the join relationship, then those rows won’t be included in the results.</p>

<p class="TX">To demonstrate how this works, use the following query to add a row to the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">authors</samp> table, replacing <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_Italic_I_11">Your Name</samp> with your own name:</p>

<p class="TX"><a href="#tab12-10">Table 12-10</a> has an extra row that the output of <a href="#list12-1">Listing 12-1</a> didn’t have.

<h3 class="H1" id="sec21"><span id="h-308"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Introducing the MySQL Command Line Client</samp></h3>

<p class="TNI">So far, you’ve run all of your SQL queries through Adminer for a simpler user experience as you learned the basics of SQL. MySQL clients like Adminer work well for everyday tasks like browsing data in databases, running individual queries, and quickly creating new tables. However, for some tasks, you’ll need to use the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">mysql</samp> command line client.</p>

<p class="TX">For example, later in this chapter, you’ll use the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">mysql</samp> client to import data from a SQL backup file from the Epik dataset into your MySQL server. SQL backup files are simply text files, generally with filenames that end in <i>.sql</i>, full of SQL queries—sometimes several gigabytes of SQL queries. To import the backup, the client runs each query in the file, one after the other. Adminer’s import feature allows you to upload a <i>.sql</i> file, but the Adminer Docker service has an upload limit of 128MB by default. The SQL backup from the Epik dataset you’ll work with later in this chapter is 1.2GB compressed, so it would be impossible to import it using Adminer. (Once you import it, however, you can use either client to run queries on the data.)</p>

<p class="TX">The MySQL command line client is also useful for working on remote servers, which I’ll discuss later in the chapter. After you SSH into a server on the cloud, you can use the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">mysql</samp> command to connect to the MySQL service and then run SQL queries there.</p>

<p class="TX">The command line client isn’t ideal for all tasks. For example, if your query results include many columns, each line of output might be wider than your terminal window, causing the output to wrap, which makes it very difficult to read. Moreover, the command line client displays all the output <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_367" aria-label=" Page 367. "/>in your terminal. If you’re running many queries, it might be cumbersome to scroll back through your terminal history to find specific results that you ran previously. For everyday queries, it’s easier to use a graphical client like Adminer.</p>

<h4 class="BH" id="box-7"><samp class="SANS_Dogma_OT_Bold_B_11">PYTHON AND MYSQL</samp></h4>

<p class="BoxBodyCustom1"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">You can also consider writing Python code that interacts with MySQL databases, where your Python script acts as the SQL client. For example, you wrote Python scripts in <a href="chapter9.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> that loop through every row in a CSV and then run a block of code; you might want to similarly loop through every row returned in response to a</samp> <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">SELECT</samp> <samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">query. To write Python code that connects to a MySQL database and runs queries, you can use a module called</samp> <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">PyMySQL</samp><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">. For Python code that runs SQL queries, the table of data often isn’t displayed—instead, it’s stored in a variable, typically a list of dictionaries that you can loop through. For more information, see the documentation for the</samp> <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">PyMySQL</samp> <samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">module at</samp> <a href="https://pymysql.readthedocs.io"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">https://pymysql.readthedocs.io</samp></a><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">.</samp></p>
</aside>

<p class="TX">So far, you’ve seen SQL query results displayed in Adminer as HTML tables. If you run the same queries using the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">mysql</samp> client, the data will be displayed as text in your terminal. You’ll test this in Exercise 12-3.</p>

<p class="TX">Start by opening a terminal. If you’re using a Mac, install it in Homebrew by running this command:</p>

<pre id="pre-522"><code><b>brew install mariadb</b></code></pre>

<p class="TX">If you’re using Linux or Windows with WSL, install it by running this command:</p>

<pre id="pre-523"><code><b>sudo apt install mariadb-client</b></code></pre>

<p class="TX">You can now use the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">mysql</samp> command to connect to your MySQL database. To do so, run the following command:</p>

<pre id="pre-524"><code><b>mysql -h localhost --protocol=tcp -u root -p</b></code></pre>

<p class="TX">The <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">-h</samp> argument (short for <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">--host</samp>) tells the client the IP address or hostname of the MySQL server to which you want to connect. In this case, <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_368" aria-label=" Page 368. "/>the hostname is <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">localhost</samp>, since the server is running locally on your computer. The <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">--protocol</samp><samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">=tcp</samp> argument tells the MySQL client to connect to the server over the network, which is required when you’re running the server in a Docker container. The <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">-u</samp> argument (short for <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">--user</samp>) tells the client that you’re logging in as the root user, in this case. Finally, <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">-p</samp> (short for <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">--password</samp>) tells the client that this user is protected with a password.</p>

<p class="TX">After you run the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">mysql</samp> command, press <small>ENTER</small>. The MySQL client should prompt you to type the root user’s password:</p>

<pre id="pre-525"><code>Enter password:</code></pre>

<p class="TX">Once you enter the correct password, you should end up in the MySQL shell:</p>

<h3 class="H1" id="sec23"><span id="h-310"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">MySQL-Specific Queries</samp></h3>

<p class="TNI">Queries like <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">INSERT</samp> and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">SELECT</samp> are typically nearly identical between different versions of SQL, but each version has unique queries for actions like returning a list of databases in the server or a list of tables in a database.

</blockquote>

<p class="NOTE-TXT"><i>Technically, Adminer uses these queries too, but it runs them for you in the background. When you use the command line client, you have to run them yourself. For example, when Adminer showed you a list of databases, it ran <samp class="mono">SHOW DATABASES</samp>; for you in order to find the list; when you selected the <samp class="mono">books</samp> database, technically it ran <samp class="mono">USE books</samp>; for you.</i></p>

<p class="TX">You can run any of the queries that you ran in Adminer using the CLI client, and the rows will be displayed in your terminal.</p>

<p class="TX">As I mentioned in this chapter’s introduction, in October 2018, Robert Bowers posted a message to Gab shortly before committing the deadliest antisemitic terrorist attack in US history. GoDaddy deplatformed Gab, so it moved its domain hosting service to Epik. This wasn’t the only time that Epik helped save a far-right platform that was getting deplatformed after a mass shooting.</p>

<p class="TX">In addition to helping save Gab, Epik started hosting the domain name for the far-right message board then known as 8chan (now rebranded as 8kun) after a similar mass shooting in 2019. Patrick Crusius posted a manifesto to 8chan shortly before killing 23 people and injuring 23 more in a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, the deadliest anti-Latino terrorist attack in recent US history. Crusius’s manifesto also spouted the “great replacement” conspiracy theory. After the attack, Cloudflare suspended 8chan’s service, but Epik was there to quickly bring the site back online.</p>

<p class="TX">Epik also handled domain hosting for Parler, the social media site discussed in the previous chapter, after various platforms banned it in the aftermath of the deadly January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Epik has since become a popular domain name registrar for far-right and conservative websites worried about getting deplatformed. America’s Frontline Doctors, the anti-vaccine disinformation group I discuss in the following chapter, has also registered its domains with Epik, though it’s not at risk of being deplatformed.</p>

<p class="TX">In this section, you’ll learn about the history and motivation behind the Epik hack and the type of information this dataset contains.</p>

<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec25">

<h4 class="H2" id="sec25"><span id="h-312"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">The Epik Hack</samp></h4>

<p class="TNI">On September 1, 2021, less than a year before the US Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn the constitutional right to abortion, the state of Texas passed the most restrictive abortion law in the US—more restrictive, at the time, than any law passed since the 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade. The Texas Heartbeat Act banned abortions six weeks after pregnancy, before many people even realize they’re pregnant. The law is enforced by civil lawsuits: any member of the public who believes in forced birth can sue anyone who performs or facilitates abortions, creating a chilling effect for reproductive health care.</p>

<p class="TX">An anti-abortion lobbyist group quickly set up a website by the name ProLifeWhistleblower.com, inviting the public to anonymously submit private details about people they believed were obtaining or facilitating abortions. GoDaddy kicked the group off its platform, citing a violation of its terms of service, so the site switched its domain hosting to Epik. Epik soon caved to public pressure and likewise stopped providing service, but this was enough to catch the attention of hackers.</p>

<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_372" aria-label=" Page 372. "/>In September and October of 2021, in a series of hacks dubbed Operation Epik Fail, hackers identifying with Anonymous hacked Epik incredibly thoroughly, releasing hundreds of gigabytes of data on BitTorrent. DDoSecrets downloaded a copy of this data, added it to its leak archive, and also made it accessible to download from its public data server, rather than just using BitTorrent. Most data breaches expose a database, a collection of email, or a cache of documents. This breach included all of these, along with bootable disk images from Epik’s servers—essentially, the entire hard disks that powered its servers. You could use bootable disk images to run a snapshot of Epik’s complete servers in a virtual machine. With some work, this would allow you to rifle through <i>everything</i> hosted on these servers.</p>

<p class="TX">The hackers published their leaks in three parts over the course of four weeks. In a press release accompanying the first data leak (see <a href="#fig12-7">Figure 12-7</a>), they announced that they had released “a decade’s worth of data” from Epik. “This dataset is all that’s needed to trace the actual ownership and management of the fascist side of the Internet that has eluded researchers, activists, and, well, just about everybody,” the press release continued.</p>
<figure class="IMG"><img class="img100" id="fig12-7" src="Images/Figure12-7.png" alt="A screenshot of the press release that the hackers included with the Epik data. The release spells out “Operation EPIK FAIL” in text art." width="695" height="408"/>

</figure>

<p class="TX">It’s true: the Epik dataset includes 10 years of data from the company, including all of the data from nine MySQL databases. These databases include tables full of customers of various Epik products, like their domain name registrar; their service that protects websites against attacks, called BitMitigate; and their VPN service, called Anonymize. The databases also include information about domain name purchases, email forwarding for these domains, credit card transactions, customers’ passwords, and more.</p>

<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_373" aria-label=" Page 373. "/>The most important data in the Epik dataset, in my opinion, is the WHOIS privacy data containing information on the owners behind the domain names Epik hosts.</p>

</section>

<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec26">

<h4 class="H2" id="sec26"><span id="h-313"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Epik’s WHOIS Data</samp></h4>

<p class="TNI"><i>WHOIS</i> (pronounced “who is”) data is the public ownership information you’re required to provide when buying a domain name. This generally includes contact details like names, email addresses, phone numbers, and physical addresses, along with the domain’s registrant contact, administrative contact, and technical contact (in many cases, the same person plays all three roles). Which organization keeps track of WHOIS records depends on the domain name in question, but the records are all public. A quick internet search should turn up plenty of online services that allow you to look up WHOIS data for any given domain. The <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">whois</samp> command line tool also lets you look up WHOIS data from a terminal.</p>

<p class="TX">Public WHOIS data creates a major privacy issue, since it allows anyone to easily discover not only the owner of a domain but also their PII. To combat this, many domain registrars offer WHOIS privacy services, where they’ll put their own information in the WHOIS record or just replace the owner name with something like REDACTED FOR PRIVACY on their customers’ behalf.</p>

<p class="TX">Epik runs a WHOIS privacy service, hiding the ownership information of many far-right domain names from the public. But the Epik dataset includes that hidden information. As long as a domain name was registered on Epik before September 2021, when the hack occurred, you can use this dataset to look up its true owners.</p>

<p class="TX">You can find the WHOIS ownership data associated with any domain name simply by running <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W7Bold_B_11">whois</samp> <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W7Bold_Italic_BI_11">domain_name</samp> in a terminal. This command will look up the public information, meaning that if a domain uses a WHOIS privacy service, you won’t get to see who actually owns it. For example, you would run the following command to find the ownership information about the Oath Keepers domain name, oathkeepers.org:</p>

<pre id="pre-533"><code><b>whois oathkeepers.org</b></code></pre>

<p class="TX">When I ran this command, I got the following output:</p>

<var>--snip--</var></code></pre>

<p class="TX">Public WHOIS data told me that oathkeepers.org was first registered on March 1, 2009; it expires in 2032; and its current registrar was Epik. However, all the contact information for the person who registered it was listed as <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">REDACTED FOR PRIVACY</samp>, effectively hiding the domain ownership information from the public.</p>

<p class="TX">If you search the Epik dataset for this domain name, however, as you’ll learn to do later in this chapter, you can find all the redacted site ownership details. When I searched the dataset, I found that the oathkeepers.org registrant organization is Oath Keepers, and the registrant name is Stewart Rhodes. As noted in <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a></span>, Rhodes is the Oath Keepers founder who was convicted of seditious conspiracy for his role in the January 6, 2021, attack and subsequently sentenced to 18 years in prison. The dataset also includes Rhodes’ phone number, email address, and a physical address in Granbury, Texas.</p>

<p class="TX">Interestingly, the administrator and technical contacts for this domain lists the company eJam Systems LLC, along with the name Edward Durfee, an email address at ejamsystems.com, a phone number, and a home address in Northvale, New Jersey. eJam Systems LLC appears to be a right-wing company, run by Edward Durfee, that did tech work for the Oath Keepers. None of this information was available in the WHOIS records, but now it’s all public, thanks to the Epik hack. If you check out the email in the <i>sentmail648</i> folder you imported in <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a></span>, you’ll find messages from the address <i>oksupport@oathkeepers.org</i> all signed by Edward Durfee, IT Support.</p>
<blockquote>

<p class="NOTE-TXT"><i>In <a href="chapter1.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, I discussed not revealing unnecessary PII. In this case, I believe that publishing Durfee’s name, the city he lives in, and the name of his company is in the public interest. Since he’s an organizer for the Oath Keepers, a group that attempted to subvert democracy, this makes him a legitimate target of reporting. There’s no public interest in publishing his home address, phone number, or email address, though.</i></p>

<p class="TX">After the Epik hack, reporter Mikael Thalen wrote an article for the Daily Dot based on the leaked WHOIS data and focusing on Ali Alexander, one of the primary organizers on January 6 and a major activist in the Stop the Steal movement. Thalen used the Epik data to show that in the days following the riot, Alexander began turning on WHOIS privacy for over 100 domains he owned, nearly half of them connected to the election lie, such as stopthestealmovement.com and stopthestealnews.com. You can read <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_375" aria-label=" Page 375.

<h3 class="H1F" id="sec27"><span id="h-314"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Heavy_B_21">Exercise 12-4: Download and Extract Part of the Epik Dataset</samp></h3>

<p class="TNI">The Epik dataset is split into three folders: <i>EpikFail</i>, <i>EpikFailTheB:Sides</i>, and <i>EpikFailYouLostTheGame,</i> which you can download either using BitTorrent or from DDoSecrets’ public data server at <a href="https://data.ddosecrets.com/Epik/"><i>https://<wbr/>data<wbr/>.ddosecrets<wbr/>.com<wbr/>/Epik<wbr/>/</i></a>. Inside the first folder, <i>EpikFail</i>, are three subfolders: <i>emails</i>, <i>filesystems</i>, and <i>sql</i>. The <i>emails</i> folder contains email messages from a single email account related to Epik, while the <i>filesystems</i> folder contains all of the files taken from one of Epik’s Linux servers. The <i>sql</i> folder, by far the largest folder in the first part of the Epik dataset, contains backups of MySQL databases. For this exercise, you’ll download a single MySQL backup file, <i>api_system.sql.gz</i>, which takes only 1.2GB of disk space.</p>

<p class="TX">On your <i>datasets</i> USB disk, create a new folder called <i>Epik</i> for the Epik dataset, and then download <i>api_system.sql.gz</i> from <a href="https://data.ddosecrets.com/Epik/EpikFail/sql/api_system.sql.gz"><i>https://<wbr/>data<wbr/>.ddosecrets<wbr/>.com<wbr/>/Epik<wbr/>/EpikFail<wbr/>/sql<wbr/>/api<wbr/>_system<wbr/>.sql<wbr/>.gz</i></a> and save it there. Now, open a terminal (if you’re in Windows, use an Ubuntu terminal) and change to the <i>Epik</i> folder on your <i>datasets</i> USB disk like so:</p>

<pre id="pre-535"><code>micah@trapdoor ~ % <b>cd /Volumes/datasets/Epik</b>

micah@trapdoor Epik % <b>ls -lh</b>

total 0

-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff   1.2G Sep 17  2021 api_system.sql.gz</code></pre>

<p class="TX">The file is a compressed backup of a MySQL database with the extension <i>.sql.gz</i>, meaning that it was compressed using GZIP discussed in <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a></span>. To extract the <i>api_system.sql.gz</i> file, run the following command:</p>

<pre id="pre-536"><code><b>gunzip api_system.sql.gz</b></code></pre>

<p class="TX">SQL data compresses very well: the original <i>api_system.sql.gz</i> file is 1.2GB, but the extracted version, <i>api_system.sql</i>, is 20GB, taking up 16 times as much disk space.</p>

<p class="TX">Now that you’ve extracted the file, the next step is to import it into your MySQL database in Exercise 12-5.</p>

<p class="TNI">You’ll use the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">mysql</samp> command line client to create a new database called <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">epikfail_api_system</samp>.

<p class="TNI">The simplest way to import a MySQL backup into a MySQL client is to pipe the data into the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">mysql</samp> program, by running the following command:</p>

<pre id="pre-539"><code><b>cat</b> <b><var>filename.sql</var></b> <b>| mysql -h localhost --protocol=tcp -u root -p</b> <b><var>database_name</var></b></code></pre>

<p class="TX">The problem is that you’d see no output—no progress bars or any other indication that it’s actually working. This is fine for small SQL backups that take a few seconds to import, but it might take hours or days to import large backups. To solve this problem, I use a simple program called <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">pv</samp>, which stands for “Pipe Viewer,” to display a progress bar. The <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">pv</samp> command is similar to the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">cat</samp> command, but it also displays useful output so you can be sure your command is running.</p>

<p class="TX">If you’re using a Mac, install <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">pv</samp> in Homebrew by running the following command:</p>

<pre id="pre-540"><code><b>brew install pv</b></code></pre>

<p class="TX">If you’re using Linux or Windows with WSL, install <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">pv</samp> by running the following command:</p>

<pre id="pre-541"><code><b>sudo apt install pv</b></code></pre>

<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_377" aria-label=" Page 377. "/>Once you’ve installed <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">pv</samp>, make sure you’re in the <i>Epik</i> folder and run this command:</p>

<pre id="pre-542"><code><b>pv api_system.sql | mysql -h localhost --protocol=tcp -u root -p epikfail_api_system</b></code></pre>

<p class="TX">Just like <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">cat</samp>, <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">pv</samp> should load data from <i>api_system.sql</i> and pipe it into <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">mysql</samp>, but this time it should show you a progress bar like this one, complete with the import speed and the estimated time that it will finish:</p>

<p class="TX">In this example, I had been running the import for 33 minutes and 47 seconds. It had progressed through 2.89GB of the data (14 percent) and estimated it would finish in 3 hours and 15 minutes, at a current speed of 587KB per second (though import speed varies greatly depending on which query is currently running).

<p class="TX">To search the list of Epik domains for ones containing specific keywords, use the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">LIKE</samp> operator in the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">WHERE</samp> clause. For example, try using the following queries to search for domains that mention the word <i>Trump</i>, ordered by the most recently created domains:</p>

<pre id="pre-547"><code>SELECT id, name, cr_date, exp_date

FROM domain

WHERE name LIKE '%trump%'

ORDER BY cr_date DESC;</code></pre>

<p class="TX">As you learned earlier, using <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">LIKE</samp> makes the search case insensitive, and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">%</samp> characters are wildcards. Filtering the results by <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">name LIKE '%trump%'</samp> will display only results that include <i>trump</i> (regardless of capitalization) somewhere in their name.</p>

<p class="TX">The query returns 413 results total. <a href="#tab12-14">Table 12-14</a> shows the first 10 results.</p>

<p class="TX">Clearly, many people used Epik to register Trump-related domain names. These results don’t include any ownership information for these domains, though. To find that missing information, let’s take a look at the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">privacy</samp> table.</p>

<h4 class="H2" id="sec33"><span id="h-320"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">The privacy Table</samp></h4>

<p class="TNI">The <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">privacy</samp> table has 721,731 rows of data. Like the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">domain</samp> table, it has a <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">domain</samp> column that lists domain names, but it also includes columns with all of the private WHOIS details. Relevant columns include <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">admin_org</samp>, <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">admin _name</samp>, <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">admin_email</samp>, <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">admin_address</samp>, <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">admin_phone</samp>, and other similar information. There are also numerous similar columns with <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">tech_</samp>, <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">bill_</samp>, and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">reg_</samp> prefixes. The data in this table includes WHOIS data for the administrator contact, the technical contact, the billing contact, and the registrant contact. There’s also a <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">date_add</samp> column with a timestamp, presumably noting when this domain was added to Epik’s system.</p>

<p class="TX">I mentioned earlier that, in 2019, Patrick Crusius posted a manifesto to 8chan before killing 23 people and injuring 23 more in El Paso, Texas. In the aftermath of the terrorist attack, 8chan moved its domain name hosting to Epik. With that in mind, search the data for 8chan.co, 8chan’s domain name, to see who is behind the site:</p>

<pre id="pre-548"><code>SELECT * FROM privacy WHERE domain='8CHAN.CO';</code></pre>

<p class="TX"><a href="#tab12-15">Table 12-15</a> shows partial results from this query. The query selects all columns (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">*</samp>), but I included only the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">admin_</samp> columns here because the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">tech_</samp>, <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">bill_</samp>, and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">reg_</samp> columns all have the exact same data that appears in the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">admin_</samp> column.</p>

<p class="TX">This domain was added to Epik’s system the night of August 4, 2019. This was the day after Crusius posted his manifesto to 8chan and then went on his anti-Latino murder spree.</p>

<p class="TX">It’s public knowledge that Jim Watkins and his son, Ron Watkins, ran 8chan at the time (they are also behind today’s rebrand, 8kun). According to the HBO documentary miniseries <i>Q: Into the Storm</i>, directed and produced by Cullen Hoback, the pair are also by far the most likely people behind the QAnon conspiracy cult. Jim Watkins, an American, lived in the <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_381" aria-label=" Page 381. "/>Philippines at the time of Crusius’s rampage. As you can see from the hidden WHOIS data, the admin address is for a property in the Philippines. This increases confidence that the data is authentic, and also gives key data points about Jim Watkins in case we wanted to research him further: an address and phone number.</p>

<p class="TX">Since Watkins runs a website popular among American terrorists and is likely one of the people behind QAnon, the next logical step is to check if he or his company, Loki Technology, owned any other domain names on Epik. To find out, try running this query in the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">epikfail_api_system</samp> database:</p>

<pre id="pre-549"><code>SELECT * FROM privacy WHERE admin_email='domains@nttec.com';</code></pre>

<p class="TX">This query searches for domains that list <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">admin_email</samp> as <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">domains@nttec.com</samp>, which is the administrator email address on 8chan.co. However, it returns just a single row for that domain. Run the following query, modified with the expression <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">admin_email LIKE '%@nttec.com'</samp> to check for domains where <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">admin_email</samp> is any email address at the nttec.com domain:</p>

<pre id="pre-550"><code>SELECT * FROM privacy WHERE admin_email LIKE '%@nttec.com';</code></pre>

<p class="TX">However, this query has the same results. For your next query, switch tactics and search for domains that list <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">admin_org</samp> as anything mentioning Loki Technology, using the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">admin_org LIKE '%Loki Technology%'</samp> expression. The expression includes wildcard characters, just in case Watkins listed his company slightly differently on different domains, like “Loki Technology, Inc.” instead of “Loki Technology, Incorporated”:</p>

<pre id="pre-551"><code>SELECT * FROM privacy WHERE admin_org LIKE '%Loki Technology%';</code></pre>

<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_382" aria-label=" Page 382. "/>This query returns the same result. For a final query, search the domains that list <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">admin_name</samp> as <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Jim Watkins</samp>, using <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">LIKE</samp> to make the search case insensitive:</p>

<pre id="pre-552"><code>SELECT * FROM privacy WHERE admin_name LIKE 'Jim Watkins';</code></pre>

<p class="TX">Unfortunately, all these queries return just one result: the 8chan.co row.</p>

<p class="TX">In the next section, you’ll learn about how I eventually found more information about domains owned by Jim Watkins in the Epik dataset, just not in the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">epikfail_api_system</samp> database. For now, let’s look at some final interesting tables in this database.</p>

<p class="TNI">The <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">hosting</samp> table has 3,934 rows and appears to show websites that Epik actually runs the servers for, not just the domain name registration. Columns include <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">domain</samp>, <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">cr_date</samp>, <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">username</samp>, <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">password</samp> (in plaintext, though it’s not clear what these usernames and passwords are for), <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">plan</samp> (like silver, gold, or platinum), <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">server_id</samp>, and others. Run the following query to view the most recent rows:</p>

<pre id="pre-553"><code>SELECT id, domain, cr_date, plan, server_id

FROM hosting

ORDER BY cr_date DESC

LIMIT 5;</code></pre>

<p class="TX">Since the query uses the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">ORDER BY cr_date DESC</samp> clause, the results will be sorted from most recent to oldest. The <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">LIMIT 5</samp> clause means the results will include at most five rows. <a href="#tab12-16">Table 12-16</a> shows the results from this query.</p>

<p class="TX">The passwords in this table are all in plaintext. In fact, if you load <i>https://<wbr/>hosting9<wbr/>.epik<wbr/>.com:2083</i> in Tor Browser, you’ll see the login page for cPanel, software that’s used to manage shared web hosting systems like this. The usernames and passwords in the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">hosting_server</samp> table are likely the credentials to log in to this cPanel server—but don’t actually try this out. As noted earlier, it’s fine for you to see the passwords scattered across datasets, but actually attempting to log in to an account with them is illegal. In any case, Epik has probably changed its passwords since the data breach.</p>

<p class="TNI">The MySQL databases from Epik contain an overwhelming amount of data that’s useful for extremism research, and only a fraction of that data is in the <i>api_system.sql.gz</i> backup that you’ve imported for this chapter. Some of the other databases, such as <i>intrust.sql.gz</i>, contain even more interesting information. If you’re curious, I suggest downloading, importing, and investigating all nine MySQL databases from the Epik dataset.</p>

<p class="TX">Some of these databases would likely take your computer days to finish importing and would require a large amount of disk space. It’s more convenient to download and work with databases like these on a server in the cloud rather than on your local computer. To do so, follow these steps:</p>
<ol class="NL">

<li class="ListNumber">Create a new VPS on a cloud service provider (making sure it has plenty of disk space) and SSH into it, like you did in Exercise 4-4.</li>
<li class="ListNumber">Use <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">wget</samp> to download just the compressed database backups, a total of 14GB, from <a href="https://data.ddosecrets.com/Epik/EpikFail/sql/"><i>https://<wbr/>data<wbr/>.ddosecrets<wbr/>.com<wbr/>/Epik<wbr/>/EpikFail<wbr/>/sql<wbr/>/</i></a>. Alternatively, using a CLI BitTorrent client, you could download the entire first part of the Epik dataset, which is 35GB of data, similar to what you did in Exercise 4-5.</li>
<li class="ListNumber">Extract the compressed MySQL database backups as you did in Exercise 12-4. By the time you’re done extracting these files, you’ll have 145GB of MySQL backup files.</li>
<li class="ListNumber">Install a MySQL server on your VPS. There are various ways of doing this, but one option is to install Docker on your VPS and run a MySQL server as you did in Exercise 12-3. Since your VPS will be running Linux, just make sure to follow the Linux instructions there.</li>
<li class="ListNumber">Using the command line MySQL client, create nine databases, one for each backup file. Next, using <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">pv</samp> and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">mysql</samp>, import all nine database <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_385" aria-label=" Page 385. "/>backups as you did in Exercise 12-5. This step will likely take your VPS several days to finish, but since the remote server is handling the import, this won’t disrupt other work on your computer.</li>
</ol>

<p class="TX">These are essentially the steps I followed when I investigated the Epik dataset at The Intercept. The downside to doing this all in the cloud is that you’ll need to pay a monthly bill to your hosting provider for the server that you’re using. However, once you have a remote MySQL server full of Epik databases, you can use a MySQL client to connect to it and run queries, which will allow you to analyze hundreds of gigabytes of leaked databases.</p>

<p class="TX">The most useful part of the Epik dataset, in my opinion, is the fact that you can use it to peel back the curtain behind Epik’s WHOIS privacy service. You did this some in the <span class="Xref">“Exploring Epik’s SQL Database”</span> section, but you looked only in the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">privacy</samp> table of the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">epikfail_api_system</samp> database. But that isn’t the only place where you can find WHOIS privacy data.</p>

<p class="TX">The nine different MySQL databases in the Epik leak appear to have lots of duplicate data. For example, the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">epikfail_intrust</samp> database has a table called <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">domains_whois</samp> with all of the same columns as the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">privacy</samp> table. The <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">domains_whois</samp> table has 1.4 million rows of data, roughly twice as many as the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">privacy</samp> table, though many of the rows appear to contain similar data. In the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">epikfail_whois</samp> database, there’s a table called <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">data</samp> with similar columns and 1.3 million rows of data. All three tables have various duplicates of the same WHOIS data, so you may want to search them all before concluding that a domain name ownership isn’t in this dataset.</p>

<p class="TX">In the <span class="Xref">“Exploring Epik’s SQL Database”</span> section, you ran some queries in <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">epiktrust_api_system</samp> to find domains that Jim Watkins owns other than 8chan.co, but they fell short. If you import additional databases, can you find other domains he owns? When I ran similar queries in the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">epikfail_intrust</samp> database on the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">domains_whois</samp> table, which has more data than the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">privacy</samp> table in the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">epiktrust_api_system</samp> database, I got some hits. If you want to run this query yourself, you’ll need to first download and import the <i>intrust.sql</i> database into your MySQL server.</p>

<p class="TX">Here’s the query I ran to search the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">domains_whois</samp> table in the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">epikfail _intrust</samp> database for domains owned by Jim Watkins’s company:</p>

<pre id="pre-557"><code>SELECT * FROM domains_whois WHERE admin_email LIKE '%@nttec.com';</code></pre>

<p class="TX"><a href="#tab12-19">Table 12-19</a> lists the truncated results of this query, showing only some of the columns. As you can see, Jim Watkins owns all of the domains listed in the results.</p>

<p class="TX">At the time of writing, the domain 5ch.net loaded a Japanese-language site called 5channel. When I loaded 2ch.net, it failed with a “connection timed out” error from Cloudflare, and when I loaded bbspink.com, I got an “access denied” error from Cloudflare saying that the site blocks connections from the US. I connected to a VPN in Europe and tried again; this time, it redirected to 5ch.net. If you’d like, you can try the same steps yourself.</p>

<p class="TX">As you explore more databases, you’ll discover that writing SQL queries to find what you’re looking for takes some trial and error. Sometimes the results from one query will inform what you should search for next—as you’ve seen, I used the email that Watkins registered 8chan.co with to find his other domains, for example. When you don’t find what you’re looking for, tweak your queries to make them more broad, or search a different field that might give you similar information.</p>

<h3 class="H1" id="sec36"><span id="h-323"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Summary</samp></h3>

<p class="TNI">In this chapter, you’ve learned how to run your own MySQL server on your computer using Docker containers. You took a crash course in SQL, the language used to communicate with SQL servers, and were introduced to Epik, the online service provider for right-wing extremists and American terrorists who have committed mass murder. Finally, you downloaded a MySQL database backup from the 2021 Epik Fail dataset, imported it into your own local MySQL server, and ran SQL queries to begin investigating it yourself.</p>

<p class="TX">This marks the conclusion of <a href="part4.xhtml">Part IV</a>, which has given you the foundational tools and techniques to explore almost any dataset you can get your hands on. <a href="part5.xhtml">Part V</a>, the final two chapters of the book, doesn’t include any exercises. Instead, it describes real data-driven investigations I’ve worked on in the past, shows you what code I wrote and why, and explains exactly how I used the skills I’ve taught you throughout this book to find revelations. I hope you’ll use these case studies as inspiration for your own future data-driven investigations.</p>

    to interpret circuit diagrams and use breadboards. Then I’ll show you, step-by-step,
    how to build a simple circuit on a breadboard. After that, you’re on your own:
    you’ll rely on parts lists and circuit diagrams to build your circuits. Building
    circuits from diagrams is an essential skill for anyone interested in electronics,
    from beginners to experts.'

    *Circuit diagrams* are drawings that show you how to connect components to build
    an electronic circuit (see [Figure 1](intro.xhtml#introfig1)).

- en: The parts list tells you which component values you should use—for example,
    a resistor with a value of 470 Ω or a capacitor with a value of 10 μF. Each component
    has a symbol, and these symbols are connected with lines that show you how to
    connect the components. With a little practice with circuit diagrams, you’ll quickly
    learn how to distinguish the different symbols.

- en: A *breadboard* is a really simple tool for building a circuit. Because you don’t
    have to solder—you just plug in the components—you can easily reuse components
    if you want to build something else later.

- en: Most breadboards have two areas for components and two areas for power supplies.
    I’ve labeled these four areas in [Figure 2](intro.xhtml#introfig2). The five holes
    of each row in a component area—labeled with a numeral—are connected by metal
    strips inside the board. The rows in the left component area are not connected
    to the rows in the right component area.

- en: The wires of a component are called its *pins*, *legs*, or *leads*. To make
    a connection between two components, you plug their pins into the same row in
    one of the component areas. If you can’t connect them on the same row, you can
    use a jumper wire in order to make the connection from one row to another.

    upper pin of the LED are connected to each other on row 7\. The upper pin of the
    resistor and the lower pin of the LED don’t share a row with any component, so
    they aren’t connected to anything.

    the positive (or plus) terminal of your battery to the top-left hole of the left-hand
    supply area, all the holes from the top of that column to the bottom will be connected
    to the positive terminal of your battery.

- en: The methods we’ve looked at so far were developed by statisticians or, in the
    case of boosting, by both statisticians and ML researchers. In this part, the
    two methods under discussion, support vector machines and neural networks, originated
    solely in the ML world.

- en: Both of these methods are used primarily in classification applications. Support
    vector machines are predicated on there being a line (in two dimensions—that is,
    two features) or a hyperplane (three or more features) that (mostly) separates
    the data by class. The coefficients in these lines or hyperplanes will work somewhat
    like those in linear models, though in a more complex manner. The coefficients
    are obtained by minimizing a sum similar to that of linear models, though again
    more complex.

- en: Neural networks will also share these similarities. Using the most popular *activation
    function* `ReLU()`, the feature space is also broken up into portions defined
    by hyperplanes (though the original goal is not expressed in those terms), and
    again a certain sum is minimized.

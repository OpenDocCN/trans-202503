<h3 class="h3" id="lev36"><strong>INTRODUCING THE TRANSISTOR</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In this circuit, you’ll use a transistor—specifically, an <em>NPN transistor</em>. It has three pins:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Top pin: Collector</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Middle pin: Base</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Bottom pin: Emitter</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="indent">Don’t worry about the meaning of the pin names—just think of them as labels.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Turn the transistor so its label is facing you and compare the pins to <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig1">Figure 2-1</a>. Note, however, that different manufacturers arrange the pins differently. The safest bet when you’re using a new transistor is to check the pinout in the transistor’s documentation, or <em>datasheet</em>.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="h3" id="lev37"><strong>ABOUT THE CIRCUIT</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In this project, you’ll build a touch sensor by creating a touchpad from two uninsulated wires. Using a transistor, you can detect when someone touches the touchpad and turn a light on. When someone touches the touchpad, the high resistance in their finger connects the base of the transistor to the positive terminal of the battery. This completes the path from the battery’s positive terminal to its negative terminal and allows a tiny current to flow from the base to the emitter.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The current is tiny because human skin is a poor conductor and has a high resistance; the current is too weak to light an LED directly, which is why we need the transistor. The tiny current flowing from the base to the emitter will turn the transistor “on” so that a larger current can flow from the collector to the emitter. Current will flow through the LED and the resistor—making the LED light up—only if the transistor is turned on.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When nobody is touching the touchpad, the base is left unconnected, so no current will flow through that pin and the LED will not light up.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To create the touchpad, clip off a bit of your LED’s pins, as shown in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig2">Figure 2-2</a>. Then place these horizontally on two rows. Leave one hole open for connecting the touchpad to the rest of the circuit.</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><span class="red"><strong>CAUTION</strong></span></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>Do not allow the two metal pads of the touchpad to make contact when the battery is connected. If they touch, a lot of current will flow from the base to the emitter and you might damage your transistor, making it unusable.</em></p>&#13;

<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-2</strong> Cutting the pins off your LED to use as a touchpad</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Place the cut-off pins horizontally on two rows. Make sure you leave one hole in each of those rows open so you can connect the touchpad to the rest of the circuit.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev38"><strong>COMMON MISTAKES</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">If you can’t get the circuit to work, make sure you haven’t made any of these common mistakes:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Mixing up the pins of the transistor</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Destroying the transistor by letting the two metal pads of the touchpad make direct contact</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Connecting the LED backward</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Dry fingertip; try wetting your finger a bit (damp skin has a lower resistance, allowing a bit more current to flow)</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you’re still struggling with this circuit, you can find more resources through the book’s website at <em><a href="https://nostarch.com/circuits/">https://nostarch.com/circuits/</a></em>.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev39"><strong>HOW THE CIRCUIT WORKS</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">To get current to flow in a circuit, you need a path from the battery’s positive terminal to its negative terminal. If you don’t have this path, current can’t flow and the LED won’t light up. Turning the transistor “on” allows current to flow through it from its collector to its emitter.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To turn the transistor on, you need to have current flowing from its base to its emitter, which in turn lets current flow from its collector to its emitter. The amount of current flowing from the base to the emitter controls how much current can flow from the collector to the emitter.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can find the relationship between the base-to-emitter and the collector-to-emitter currents from the <em>current gain</em> of the transistor. The gain is often called h<sub>FE</sub> or β (beta). For a general-purpose transistor like the one you’re using here, the current gain is about 100. This means <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_25"/>the collector-to-emitter current can be up to 100 times larger than the base-to-emitter current.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In this circuit, when no one is touching the touchpad, there is no current flowing from the base to the emitter. This means the transistor is “off” and there’s no current flowing through the resistor and the LED.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When you touch the touchpad, your finger acts as a resistor from the positive terminal of the battery to the base of the transistor. A tiny current runs through the base to the emitter, which produces a larger current from the collector to the emitter. Current will also run through your LED, lighting it up.</p>&#13;

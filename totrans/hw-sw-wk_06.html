<p class="noindent">Sometimes the hard work of software is obvious to everyone, as it is with movie CGI and video game graphics. You don’t have to know anything about how computers work to be impressed with the visuals in films like <em>Avatar</em> and games like <em>Crysis</em>. Sometimes, though, software is doing its most amazing work when it looks like it’s not working hard at all.</p>
<p class="indent">Watching a high-definition movie on a disc or streamed over the Internet is something most of us take for granted. Isn’t that just storing and displaying images? Why would that require special techniques? To understand why we should be impressed with Blu-ray video and Netflix streaming, let’s look at what video was like before these formats came to be.</p>
<p class="indent">Videocassettes, the earliest home video medium, recorded images on a roll of magnetic tape. These were analog recordings—magnetic transcriptions of the same signal that would’ve been broadcast by television antennas. The video resolution was even lower than what we now call “standard <a id="page_116"/>definition,” and as with other analog recordings like audiocassettes and vinyl records, the quality of the video would degrade over time. The one upside to videocassettes was their capacity: a longer movie merely required a longer spool of tape.</p>
<p class="indent">Next came the LaserDisc. About the size of LP records, these discs looked like larger versions of today’s DVDs and Blu-ray discs, but like videocassettes, they were still storing the analog broadcast-format signal. However, LaserDiscs recorded a higher-resolution picture that came close to standard definition, and allowed you to jump to particular places in the video without having to rewind or fast-forward the way you would with a videocassette. For a while, the LaserDisc seemed like the future of video, but now capacity was a problem. Unlike the effectively limitless capacity of a magnetic tape roll, LaserDiscs could hold only 60 minutes of video per side, so watching a movie meant flipping the disc halfway through or even switching discs.</p>
<p class="indent">Today, the problem of capacity is even more serious. Our Blu-ray discs are much smaller than LaserDiscs, but our videos are a much higher resolution. Let me put the problem into numbers. In high-definition video each frame is a 1920×1080 bitmap, a total of 2,073,600 pixels. If each pixel is stored in three-byte RGB format, one frame of a high-definition movie would require 6,220,800 bytes, or about 6.2 megabytes (<em>mega</em> means “million”). Movies are recorded at 24 or 30 frames per second, which is 1,800 frames per minute, 108,000 frames per hour, or 216,000 frames for a two-hour film. If each frame is 6,220,800 bytes, then 216,000 frames is 1,343,693 megabytes, or about 1,345 gigabytes (<em>giga</em> means “billion”).</p>
<p class="indent">How can all of that data fit on a Blu-ray disc? Part of the answer is the “blu-ray” itself, a blue laser that’s narrower than the laser used on LaserDiscs or even conventional DVDs, allowing more data to be packed into a smaller area, just as smaller print allows more words on a page. Even so, a Blu-ray can store only about 50 gigabytes(GB) of data, less than 4 percent of what’s required.</p>
<p class="indent">Streaming video has the same problem. If one frame of video is 6.2 megabytes (MB), and the video is running at 30 frames per second, then streaming requires an Internet connection of 186 megabytes per second (MBps). A typical home broadband connection is more like 4MBps. What’s worse, because of traffic congestion and hiccups in the network, you can’t count on maintaining the full rated bandwidth over the course of a long transmission. Realistically, streaming video should use no more than a couple of MBps at most.</p>
<p class="indent">So how can we fit giant amounts of video data into these small containers? The answer is <em>data compression</em>—storing data in a format that requires fewer bytes than the original format. Compression techniques can be broadly divided into two categories. With <em>lossless compression</em>, the compressed data can be restored to its exact original state. In contrast, <em>lossy compression</em> accepts that the restored data may be slightly different than the original. Video streaming and storage uses a combination of both types of compression. In this chapter, we’ll first investigate some general <a id="page_117"/>compression techniques using simple examples. Then we’ll see how these ideas apply to video, producing highly compressed sequences of images that look nearly as good as the uncompressed originals.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec01"><strong>Run-Length Encoding</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Most of us have employed some form of lossless compression, though we wouldn’t have called it that, because many techniques for lossless compression are commonsense ideas. One such method is <em>run-length encoding</em>. Suppose I were to show you a 27-digit number for one minute to see whether you could remember it an hour later. That might sound hard, but look at the number:</p>
<pre>777,777,777,555,555,555,222,222,222</pre>
<p class="indent">I suspect you wouldn’t try to remember each digit individually. Instead, you’d count the occurrences of each digit, and remember it as “nine sevens, nine fives, and nine twos.”</p>
<p class="indent">That’s run-length encoding in action. Repeats of the same piece of data (in this case, a digit) are called <em>runs</em>, and when runs are common, we can shorten the data by recording the lengths of the runs rather than the whole number. Run-length encoding is lossless compression, because if we remember the shorthand version of the number, we can reproduce the number in its original form whenever needed.</p>
<p class="indent">Just by itself, run-length encoding can provide excellent compression for certain types of images, such as icons, logos, comic-book-style illustrations— any image with large blocks of solid color. When pixels have the same color as their neighbors, we can reduce the storage requirements considerably. As an example, I’ll describe the system used by the <em>TGA</em> image file format. TGA is short for <em>Truevision Graphics Adapter</em>, an early piece of graphics hardware designed for video editors. The file format, if not the adapter, is still in use in the video industry, and is probably the simplest example of run-length encoding for images.</p>
<p class="indent">The image data in a TGA file is compressed on a row-by-row basis. Within each row, each run of two or more pixels of exactly the same color is identified. The remaining pixels are called <em>raw</em> pixels. Consider the selected row in the sample image in <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig1">Figure 6-1</a>. In this row, there are several short runs of pixels, and several raw pixels that are different from their neighbors.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="graphics/f06-01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figuret"><a id="ch6fig1"/><em>Figure 6-1: The selected row has a mix of runs and raw pixels.</em></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_118"/>The TGA format organizes runs and raw pixels into <em>packets</em>. Each packet begins with a one-byte header. The leftmost bit of the header byte determines whether it is a run packet or a raw packet. The other seven bits denote the size of the packet in pixels. Because the smallest packet has one pixel, TGA encodes the packet’s size as one less than its actual size; that is, a size field of 0000000 represents a size of 1, and 0000001 represents 2, and so on. Following the header is either the encoded color of all the pixels in the run, or for a raw packet, the colors of each individual pixel. Using the RGB color format, the row of pixels from <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig1">Figure 6-1</a> would be encoded as shown in <a href="ch06.html#ch6tab1">Table 6-1</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">This encoding requires 23 bytes versus the uncompressed size of 30 bytes. This <em>compression ratio</em> of 30:23, or about 4:3, isn’t very high, but note that a mere 4 bytes are needed to store rows where every pixel is the same color, like the top row of <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig1">Figure 6-1</a>. The overall compression ratio of this bitmap in TGA format is an impressive 300:114, or about 5:2.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec02"><strong>Dictionary Compression</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Just by itself, run-length encoding can compress pictures with large blocks of solid colors, but most of the images in movies aren’t like that. For photographs and other types of digital images with lots of color variation, software has to work much harder to find patterns exploitable by compression. One of the key tools is known as <em>dictionary compression</em>.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec01"><strong><em>The Basic Method</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Later we’ll see how dictionary compression is used on images, but the idea is easiest to understand when it is applied to a text document, so let’s start there. An uncompressed text document is stored as a series of character codes such as ASCII.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_119"/>We’ll compress this sample paragraph:</p>
<p class="bq">Those pictures created by a computer are called computer graphics. When these pictures created by the computer are viewed in a sequence, that sequence is called an animation. An entire movie created from an animation, a sequence of pictures created by a computer, is called a computer-animated movie.</p>
<p class="indent">To make this example simpler, I’ll ignore the spaces and punctuation in this text and just worry about the letters. There are 234 letters in this paragraph; stored as uncompressed ASCII text, the letters would require 234 bytes. To employ dictionary compression on this text, we first need a <em>dictionary</em>, which in this context is a numbered list of every word in the document being compressed. <a href="ch06.html#ch6tab2">Table 6-2</a> is our list of words, numbered both in decimal and binary. Note that capitalization counts: <em>an</em> and <em>An</em> are separate entries.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_120"/>As shown, 5 bits are sufficient to represent the range of positions used. Each word in the original paragraph is replaced with its position in this table. For example, instead of using eight ASCII codes (64 bits) for each appearance of the word <em>computer</em>, the 5-bit dictionary entry is used instead.</p>
<p class="indent">The dictionary itself takes up space, however, and must be included in the compressed document, so we save space only when a word appears more than once. In this example, the total number of letters for all words in our dictionary is 116, requiring 116 bytes. Replacing each of the 48 words in the sample paragraph with a 5-bit dictionary reference requires 235 bits, or about 30 bytes. The total compressed storage, then, is 146 bytes, which compared to the original 234 uncompressed bytes is a compression ratio of about 8:5. With longer documents the savings will be even better, because the text grows much faster than the dictionary. A typical novel, for example, is about 80,000 words long, but uses a vocabulary of only a few thousand words.</p>

<p class="indent">With the table in place, Huffman code compression is the same as basic dictionary compression: each word is replaced with its corresponding <a id="page_121"/>binary code. For example, the encoding for <em>the princess ate a magic toadstool</em> would start with 01 for <em>the</em>, then 100 for <em>princess</em>, and so on. In full, the encoding is:</p>
<pre>011000011000101010110</pre>
<p class="indent">As you may have noticed, the list of binary codes in <a href="ch06.html#ch6tab3">Table 6-3</a> skips some possible codes, such as 011 or 0110. Skipping codes is necessary to make this a <em>prefix code</em>, in which no binary code appears at the start of another. For example, because 01 is the code for <em>the</em>, other codes that begin with 01, such as 011 or 0110, are forbidden. Because the individual codes vary in length, a prefix code is necessary to know where each code ends. With our example, the 01 that begins the bit sequence must be the code for <em>the</em> because no other code starts with 01; the only way to partition the whole sequence is as:</p>
<pre>01 100 0011 000 1010 10110</pre>
<p class="indent">If we allowed a code that broke the prefix rule, the sequences could become ambiguous. Suppose <em>forevermore</em> is assigned the code 00. While this is a shorter code, it means the example sequence could also be partitioned as:</p>
<pre>01 100 00 110 00 1010 10110</pre>
<p class="indent">This would decode as the phrase <em>the princess forevermore good forevermore magic toadstool</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">By assigning the shortest codes to the most common words, Huffman encoding can achieve greater compression than dictionary compression alone when data can be stored as a relatively small set of codes and some codes are more common than others.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec03"><strong>Reorganizing Data for Better Compression</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Unfortunately, the images we see in videos are not good candidates for Huffman encoding. Unlike the color-block images we compressed with the run-length technique, the pixels in a video image vary across the full range of possible colors. With 16 million different possible RGB colors, it’s unlikely video images will have enough repetition to allow Huffman encoding to work. However, sometimes it’s possible to create repetition in varied data by changing how the data is stored.</p>

<pre>51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 55, 56, 58, 60, 62, 65, 67, 68, 69, 71, 70, 68, 66, 63, 61, 59, 57, 54, 51</pre>

<p class="sidebart"><a id="page_122"/><strong>COMPRESSION IN ZIP FILES</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Dictionary compression and Huffman encoding are at the heart of most general compression schemes. The <em>.zip</em> archive format, for example, can choose from a half-dozen compression methods but usually employs an algorithm called <em>deflate</em>. Rather than replacing duplicated data with a reference number from a list of words, this algorithm employs a variation of dictionary compression called a <em>sliding window</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">With this method, duplicate data is replaced with numerical indicators showing where the data occurred previously. In the textual example of <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig2">Figure 6-2</a>, there are three duplicate runs of characters. The first member of each pair is the number of characters to go back, and the second number is the length of the run. For example, the pair 5, 2 means “go back five characters, and copy two characters.”</p>

<p class="indent">The compressed version of this text can be symbolically written as “Then t[5,2] scar[5,5]ed[16,4]m.” Instead of the number pairs being stored directly, though, they are Huffman-encoded, so the most commonly occurring pairs are assigned shorter codes. The deflate method is a highly effective general compression scheme, capable of reducing the 3,138,473 characters in a raw text version of Tolstoy’s <em>War and Peace</em> to a <em>.zip</em> file of around 930,000 bytes, about a 10:3 ratio.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">If we assume a temperature range of 120 to –50, we can store each temperature in an 8-bit byte, using 192 bits total. There aren’t many duplicates in this list, though, so Huffman encoding won’t be effective. The situation improves if we rewrite this list using <em>predictive encoding</em>. For every temperature after the first, we’ll record not the temperature itself, but its difference from the previous temperature. Now the list looks like this:</p>
<pre>(51): 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, -1, -2, -2, -3, -2, -2, -2, -3, -3</pre>
<p class="indent">Whereas the original data had few duplicates, the predictive-encoded data has many. Now we can apply Huffman encoding with excellent results.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec04"><a id="page_123"/><strong><em>Quantization</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Another approach, if we are willing to accept some degradation of the data, is <em>quantization</em>, where we store the data with less precision. Suppose the weather station from the previous example also records daily rainfall amounts, taking the following readings over the course of three weeks:</p>
<pre>0.01, 1.23, 1.21, 0.02, 0.01, 0.87, 0.57, 0.60, 0.02, 0.00, 0.03, 0.03, 2.45,<br/>2.41, 0.82, 0.53, 1.29, 0.02, 0.01, 0.01, 0.04</pre>
<p class="indent">These readings have two decimal places, but maybe we don’t actually need this much precision in the data. For one thing, any amount below 0.05 might represent condensation on the collector rather than actual rain; likewise, condensation might also be the only difference between readings like 1.23 and 1.21. So let’s leave off the last digit of every number:</p>
<pre>0.0, 1.2, 1.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.8, 0.5, 0.6, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.4, 2.4, 0.8,<br/>0.5, 1.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0</pre>
<p class="indent">By itself, this compresses the data, since storing one place after the decimal will take fewer bits than storing two. In addition, the quantized data also has several runs of zeros that can be compressed with run-length encoding, and some duplicates that can be compressed by Huffman encoding.</p>
<p class="indent">These techniques point to a general multistage approach for compression. First, reorganize the data to increase the runs and duplicates, by storing small differences between numbers rather than the raw numbers themselves, quantizing the data, or both. Then compress the data with run-length and Huffman encoding.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec04"><strong>JPEG Images</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">We now have almost all the tools needed to compress video. The logical first step in compressing a video is to compress the individual images in the video. However, we can’t directly apply predictive encoding and quantization to digital photographs and other images with lots of subtle color variation; we need to convert these pictures to another format first.</p>
<p class="indent">That’s the idea behind <em>JPEG</em>, a common compressed-image format designed specifically for digital photographs. (The name is the acronym for the <em>Joint Photography Experts Group</em> that developed the format.) The compression method for this format is based on a couple of key observations of photography and human perception.</p>
<p class="indent">First, although pixel colors may vary widely throughout an image, individual pixels tend to be similar to their neighbors. If you take a picture of a leafy tree against a partly cloudy sky, lots of green leaf pixels will be next to other green pixels, blue sky pixels will neighbor blue sky pixels, and gray cloud pixels will neighbor gray cloud pixels.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, among neighboring pixels, there will be more noticeable variation in brightness levels than in color tone. For our tree photograph, each <a id="page_124"/>of the myriad leaf pixels will reflect a different quantity of sunlight, but the underlying color of each pixel will be roughly similar. Also, although the mechanisms of human vision are not completely understood, tests indicate that we perceive differences in brightness more distinctly than differences in color.</p>
<p class="indent">High compression of digital photographs is possible only with lossy compression; we have to accept some degradation of the image. Following these key observations, though, allows the JPEG format to throw away the data that is least likely to be missed. In our tree photograph, the most important distinctions are the broad differences between leaf and sky, or sky and cloud, not between two neighboring cloud pixels. After that, the most important distinction is the relative brightness of pixels, more so than relative color. The JPEG format therefore gives priority to broad differences over fine differences, and brightness over color.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec05"><strong><em>A Different Way to Store Colors</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">JPEG compression divides images into 8×8 blocks of pixels that are independently compressed. To compress brightness and color differently, each pixel’s R, G, and B values are converted to three other numbers <em>Y</em>, <em>Cb</em>, and <em>Cr</em>. Here, Y is the <em>luminance</em> of the pixel, or how much light the pixel produces. Cb is the <em>blue difference</em>, and Cr is the <em>red difference</em>. The simplest way to envision the YCbCr system is to imagine a dark green video screen with three knobs labeled Y, Cb, and Cr initially set to zero: turn up Y and the screen is brighter; turn up Cb and the screen becomes more blue and less green; turn up Cr and the screen becomes more red and less green. <a href="ch06.html#ch6tab4">Table 6-4</a> lists a few named colors in both systems for comparison. (A historical note: YCbCr is derived from the color system used in broadcast television. In the early days of color television, the remaining black-and-white televisions could properly display color transmissions by interpreting only the Y component of the signal.)</p>

<p class="indent">JPEG compresses the Y, Cb, and Cr data separately, so we can think of each 8×8 block of pixels as becoming three 8×8 blocks of Y, Cb, and Cr data. Separating the data this way takes advantage of the greater variation in brightness than in color. Under the YCbCr system, most of the differences between the pixels will be concentrated in the Y component. The lower variance in the Cb and Cr blocks will make them easier to compress, and because we’re more sensitive to variations in luminance than variations of color, the Cb and Cr blocks can be compressed more heavily.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec06"><a id="page_125"/><strong><em>The Discrete Cosine Transform</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">The conversion to YCbCr follows the observation that brightness is more important than color. To take advantage of the greater importance of broad changes over narrow changes, though, we need to convert each 8×8 data blocks yet again. The <em>discrete cosine transform (DCT)</em> converts the absolute luminance and color data into relative measurements of how these values differ from pixel to pixel. Although this transformation is applied to an entire 8×8 block of numbers, I’ll first illustrate the idea with a single row of eight numbers from the luminance (Y) block, shown as shades of gray in <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig3">Figure 6-3</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="graphics/f06-03.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figuret"><a id="ch6fig3"/><em>Figure 6-3: A row of luminance levels</em></p>
<p class="indent">To begin the DCT, we subtract 128 from each number, which has the effect of moving the 0–255 range to a range centered around 0, so that maximum brightness is 127 and absolute black is –128. The resulting luminance levels for the row are depicted as a line chart in <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig4">Figure 6-4</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="graphics/f06-04.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figuret"><a id="ch6fig4"/><em>Figure 6-4: Subtracting 128 from each luminance level centers the range of possible numbers around 0.</em></p>
<p class="indent">The DCT produces eight new numbers that each combine the eight luminance levels in a different way. <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig5">Figure 6-5</a> shows the DCT of the previous figure.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="graphics/f06-05.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figuret"><a id="ch6fig5"/><em>Figure 6-5: The discrete cosine transform of the data in <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig4">Figure 6-4</a>.</em></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_126"/>Note that the numbers are labeled with a range from “coarse” to “fine.” The leftmost number in the DCT is the simplest combination of the luminance levels: their sum. Thus, the first number is the overall brightness of the pixels, and will be positive for a bright row of pixels and negative for a dark row. The second number effectively compares the luminance levels on the left end of the row against those on the right, and is positive in this example because our luminance levels are brighter on the left than on the right. The rightmost number effectively compares each luminance value against its immediate neighbors, and is close to 0 here because the numbers in <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig4">Figure 6-4</a> change gradually.</p>
<p class="indent">These DCT numbers are the coefficients that result from an operation called <em>matrix multiplication</em>. If your eyes just glazed over, don’t worry: the operation involves nothing more than multiplication and addition. We produce each coefficient by multiplying the luminance values by a different, predetermined vector. In this context, a <em>vector</em> is just an ordered list of numbers. The eight vectors used in the DCT are illustrated in <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig6">Figure 6-6</a>. (The numbers in each vector are related to the cosine function from trigonometry, which is where the discrete cosine transform gets its name, but we can safely ignore that for this discussion.)</p>

<p class="figuret"><a id="ch6fig6"/><em>Figure 6-6: The vectors needed for our single-row DCT</em></p>
<p class="indent">To produce a coefficient for our luminance row, we multiply each number in a vector by the luminance in the same position. For example, <a href="ch06.html#ch6tab5">Table 6-5</a> shows the computation of the Vector 2 coefficient for our luminance row. Each number from the luminance row is multiplied by the number in the same position in Vector 1; then, these products are summed to get 157.386.</p>

<p class="indent">Looking at the vectors of <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig6">Figure 6-6</a>, you can see how each combines the luminance levels differently. Because every number in Vector 1 is the same positive number, the Vector 1 coefficient becomes a measure of overall brightness. Because Vector 2’s numbers gradually sweep from high to low, the second coefficient will be positive when luminance tends to fall off from the left to right in the pixel row, and negative when luminance tends to increase.

<p class="indent">The DCT, then, gives us a different way of storing the same numbers: as the relationship between the data rather than the data itself. Why is this useful? Remember that fine distinctions between pixels are less noticeable than broader distinctions. Later, you’ll see how the DCT allows the JPEG format to compress the fine details more than the broad.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec07"><strong><em>The DCT for Two Dimensions</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">JPEG compression works not on rows of pixels but on 8×8 pixel blocks, so now let’s see how the DCT operates in two dimensions. The one-dimensional DCT multiplies eight vectors with the original eight numbers to produce eight coefficients. The two-dimensional DCT, though, requires 64 <em>matrices</em>, each matrix being an 8×8 table of numbers. Like the vectors, each matrix will multiply all 64 pieces of data in the 8×8 block.</p>
<p class="indent">The matrices themselves are two-dimensional combinations of the vectors we saw earlier. This is easiest to understand pictorially. <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig7">Figure 6-7</a> shows the combination of a horizontal Vector 1 and a vertical Vector 1. Because the numbers in Vector 1 are all the same, the numbers in the resulting matrix are as well. In these matrix illustrations, lighter gray means a higher number.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="graphics/f06-07.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figuret"><a id="ch6fig7"/><em>Figure 6-7: The matrix combination of Vector 1 and itself</em></p>

<p class="noindent">Now the real compression can begin, the first step of which is quantization. <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig14">Figure 6-14</a> shows the 8×8 block of divisors used for quantizing the luminance block. Each number in the coefficient block of <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig13">Figure 6-13</a> is divided by the number in the same position in <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig14">Figure 6-14</a>, with results rounded to the nearest whole number. This degrades the image through quantization error, but note that the divisors in <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig14">Figure 6-14</a> are smallest in the upper left. Thus, the quantization error is most pronounced in the coefficients that measure the finest distinctions, where the error is least likely to be noticed. The actual values of the divisors varies according to the compression quality, with larger divisors used to quantize the Cr and Cb blocks, but the divisor block always follows this general pattern (lower values in the upper left, higher in the bottom right).</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="graphics/f06-14.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figuret"><a id="ch6fig14"/><em>Figure 6-14: The divisors used to quantize luminance blocks</em></p>
<p class="indent">The result of quantization for our sample block is shown in <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig15">Figure 6-15</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">You can see how suitable these numbers are for run-length and Huffman encoding. Most of the coefficients have been quantized all the way down to 0, with many duplicate coefficients among the rest.</p>
<p class="indent">After quantization, nonzero results tend to cluster in the upper left of the matrix, so the quantized numbers are listed in the zigzag pattern shown in <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig16">Figure 6-16</a>.</p>

<p class="figuret"><a id="ch6fig16"/><em>Figure 6-16: Storing coefficients in a zigzag order</em></p>
<p class="indent">This zigzag pattern tends to produce a very long run of zeros at the end, as it does in our example:</p>
<pre>8 10 -7 -7 6 -4 0 -2 1 -2 -1 -1 1 -1 0 0 1 0 0 -1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0<br/>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</pre>
<p class="indent">To encode the runs of zeros, we replace each nonzero entry in the list by a pair of numbers: the number of zeros skipped (possibly none), and the <a id="page_134"/>coefficient itself. For example, the eighth number in our list is a –2 that is preceded by one 0. This would become the number pair 1, –2. At this stage, our list looks like this:</p>
<pre>0, 8<br/>0, 10<br/>0, -7<br/>0, -7<br/>0, 6<br/>0, -4<br/>1, -2<br/>0, 1<br/>0, -2<br/>0, -1<br/>0, -1<br/>0, 1<br/>0, -1<br/>1, -1<br/>2, 1<br/>2, -1<br/>(all the rest are zero)</pre>
<p class="indent">Some of these number pairs, such as 0, –1, appear very frequently in these lists compared to other pairs like 0, 10. For maximum compression, the JPEG standard defines a Huffman encoding for every possible number pair in these lists. The common 0, –1 pair, for example, becomes the short Huffman code 001, while the uncommon 0, 10 pair becomes the longer code 10110010. There’s also a special code, 1010, to signal that all the rest of the coefficients in the list are 0. The Huffman encoding for our list is shown in <a href="ch06.html#ch6tab8">Table 6-8</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">All of the bits in the rightmost column, strung together, represent the compressed encoding of our original luminance block. The original block represented the luminance levels as 64 bytes, or 512 bits total. In contrast, the encoding in <a href="ch06.html#ch6tab8">Table 6-8</a> uses a mere 88 bits.</p>
<p class="indent">The two color blocks, Cr and Cb, would show even higher compression because the divisors used on the color blocks are even larger, which produces smaller numbers with shorter Huffman codes and more zeros for the run-length encoding. Overall, JPEG images typically achieve a 10:1 compression ratio. The amount of compression can be increased or reduced by using smaller or larger divisors than those shown in <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig14">Figure 6-14</a>. These divisors are adjusted by the “quality” slider in image-manipulation programs. Sliding the control to “low quality” increases the divisors, reducing the file size while increasing the quantization error.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec09"><strong><em>JPEG Picture Quality</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">High compression is great only if the restored image is indistinguishable from the original, or nearly so. Typically the alterations JPEG compression makes to an image are difficult to see. To get a feel for the changes introduced by compression, let’s compare the original block of luminance values to the block that results from compressing and decompressing, as shown in <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig17">Figure 6-17</a>.</p>

<p class="figuret"><a id="ch6fig17"/><em>Figure 6-17: The original luminance block, and the result of compressing and decompressing the block</em></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_136"/>Since it’s tough to visually compare these two blocks of numbers, <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig18">Figure 6-18</a> shows the differences as a grayscale matrix. As you can see, most of the matrix is neutral gray, indicating numbers very close to the original.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="graphics/f06-19.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figuret"><a id="ch6fig19"/><em>Figure 6-19: The amount of error in each location of the luminance block</em></p>
<p class="indent">The best evidence for the quality of JPEGs is shown in <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig19">Figure 6-19</a>. On the top is an uncompressed digital photograph. Because this photo is in grayscale, we don’t need RGB pixel color, just a single byte indicating the grayscale level. At a resolution of 975×731, this uncompressed photo requires just under 713 kilobytes of storage. In the middle is a compressed JPEG version of the original photo, requiring just 75 kilobytes of storage, which is virtually indistinguishable from the original. The photo on the bottom is a low-quality JPEG using larger divisors. While the photo takes up only about 7 kilobytes, compression artifacts are clearly visible. Many of the individual 8×8 pixel blocks have been reduced to solid squares of the same gray level. In general, JPEG can result in a 10:1 compression ratio without sacrificing visual quality.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec05"><strong>Compressing High-Definition Video</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">The JPEG format does a fantastic job of compressing images with only small sacrifices in quality, but for high-definition video we need even more compression. Remember, uncompressed high-definition video requires about 186MBps. Individually compressing each image as a JPEG would reduce that requirement to about 18MBps—a big improvement, but for streaming or disc storage we need to shrink the data to just a few MBps per second.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec10"><a id="page_138"/><strong><em>Temporal Redundancy</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">To hit this target, video compression techniques take advantage of similarities between images in sequence. <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig20">Figure 6-20</a> shows an image sequence from a movie’s opening credits.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="graphics/f06-20.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figuret"><a id="ch6fig20"/><em>Figure 6-20: A few frames of an opening title sequence</em></p>
<p class="indent">Each of these images will be shown for several seconds; which means that the sequence will contain many duplicate frames in a row. Also, even as the video transitions from one image to the next, most of the picture remains unchanged. Only the area in the center varies.</p>
<p class="indent">Now consider the image sequence shown in <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig21">Figure 6-21</a>. Although each frame differs from the next, the same elements are present in each frame, just in different places on the screen.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="graphics/f06-21.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figuret"><a id="ch6fig21"/><em>Figure 6-21: An image sequence with a moving object</em></p>
<p class="indent">These examples show two different forms of <em>temporal redundancy</em>, continuity of data from one frame to the next. Compression that exploits such redundancy is called <em>temporal compression</em>, and as we’ll see in the next section, it’s the key to achieving the compression ratios needed for video streaming and storage.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec11"><strong><em>MPEG-2 Video Compression</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">One method of temporal compression is employed by <em>MPEG-2</em>, a common video format supported by Blu-ray discs and digital broadcast television. More advanced techniques exist, but they are extensions of the ideas demonstrated here.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch06lev3sec01"><strong>Groups of Frames</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">MPEG-2 videos are divided into sequences of around 15 frames called <em>groups of pictures (GOPs)</em>. Exactly one frame in each GOP is selected to be a basic JPEG-encoded image called an <em>intracoded frame (I-Frame)</em>. This frame is the rock upon which the rest of the GOP is built. All of the other frames <a id="page_139"/>use temporal compression, which means they are stored not as the absolute colors of the pixels in the image, but by how those colors differ from those in another image in the GOP, as we’ll see shortly.</p>
<p class="indent">The other frames in the group are assigned one of two types, <em>predicted frames (P-Frames)</em> and <em>bidirectional frames (B-Frames)</em>. A P-Frame stores the difference between its pixels and those of a previous frame, while a B-Frame stores the difference between its pixels and those of a previous <em>and</em> a later frame.</p>
<p class="indent">A GOP is shown in <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig22">Figure 6-22</a>, with arrows indicating the frames referenced by the temporal compression. As you can see, everything depends on the I-Frame. During playback, it must be decoded before any other image in the GOP, after which the frames that directly reference the I-Frame can be decoded, and so on.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="graphics/f06-22.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figuret"><a id="ch6fig22"/><em>Figure 6-22: A GOP, or group of pictures</em></p>
<p class="indent">Grouping pictures this way simplifies encoding and decoding, and also limits the length of the reference “chain.” Just like a photocopy of a photocopy, the longer the chain of temporal compression, the fuzzier the image gets. The regular appearance of I-Frames is also what allows you to see images as you fast-forward or rewind; the video player just picks out the I-Frames, which can be decoded and displayed independently of the other frames in its GOP.</p>
<p class="indent">The MPEG specification gives encoding software wide discretion in forming GOPs. The number of I-Frames, which directly determines the size of GOPs, is up to the encoder, as is the number of B-Frames between the other frame types. Like the divisors used in JPEG quantization, the ability to change the relative numbers of the three frame types offers a trade-off between quality and compression. In applications where compression is paramount, like videoconferencing, I-Frames are rare and B-Frames are common, while in a Blu-ray, the encoder will use as many I-Frames as possible while still fitting all the video data on the disc.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch06lev3sec02"><strong>Temporal Compression</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">So how does the temporal compression of P-Frames and B-Frames work? In this example, we’re compressing a P-Frame by referencing an I-Frame. First, the pixels in the P-Frame are divided into 16×16 <em>macroblocks</em>. For each macroblock, the I-Frame is searched for a matching block of pixels with the same color data. This matching block may not appear in exactly the <a id="page_140"/>same place in the I-Frame, though, so it is indicated by its <em>offset</em>: the difference between the location in the P-Frame and the location in the I-Frame, expressed in screen coordinates. For example, an offset of –100, 50 indicates that the macroblock’s location in the I-Frame is 100 pixels left and 50 pixels down from its location in the P-Frame, as shown in <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig23">Figure 6-23</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="graphics/f06-23.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figuret"><a id="ch6fig23"/><em>Figure 6-23: A macroblock in a P-Frame referencing a matching block of pixels in a previous frame</em></p>
<p class="indent">In most cases, an exact match won’t be found, so in addition to storing the location of the best match, the differences between the two macroblocks must also be stored. <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig24">Figure 6-24</a> shows a luminance block from the P-Frame and the best match in the I-Frame. (I’m using 8×8 blocks instead of a full 16×16 macroblock to keep the example manageable.)</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="graphics/f06-24.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figuret"><a id="ch6fig24"/><em>Figure 6-24: A luminance block and its best match in a prior frame</em></p>
<p class="indent">Next, a block of differences is computed: each number in the I-Frame block is subtracted from the number in the same position in the P-Frame block. The result for our example is shown in <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig25">Figure 6-25</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="page_141"/><img alt="image" src="graphics/f06-25.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figuret"><a id="ch6fig25"/><em>Figure 6-25: The difference between the two luminance blocks in <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig24">Figure 6-24</a></em></p>
<p class="indent">Because the blocks are a close match, these values are all small. This is a form of predictive encoding, just like the list of temperatures shown earlier in the chapter. By storing differences, we’ve made the range of data much smaller, and therefore more easily compressed. When we apply the DCT and quantize the results, the numbers are downright tiny, as shown in <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig26">Figure 6-26</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Not every macroblock in the P-Frame is encoded in this way. In some cases, a macroblock may not be similar enough to any block of pixels in the previous frame to save any space by storing the difference. Those macroblocks can be recorded directly, like the macroblocks in an I-Frame. For a B-Frame, matching macroblocks can be found in a previous frame or a later frame, which improves the odds of a close match.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec12"><strong><em>Video Quality with Temporal Compression</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Temporal compression depends upon temporal redundancy—sequences of frames with few changes. For this reason, some videos compress much better than others. Movies with lots of camera movement, like <em>Cloverfield</em> or <em>The Blair Witch Project</em>, are difficult to compress, while movies with long takes where the camera doesn’t move, like <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>, are ideal.</p>
<p class="indent">Ultimately, video compression is a bit of an art as well as a science. As stated earlier, different MPEG-2 encoders can produce different results for the same sequence of images. Shorter GOPs, with more I-Frames and fewer B-Frames, produce better-looking video than longer GOPs, but longer GOPs mean better compression. An encoder can vary the mix of frames even within the same video, using longer GOPs when there’s high temporal redundancy and shorter GOPs when there isn’t. Also, good encoders will try to line up GOP boundaries with sharp cuts in a movie; if you’ve ever seen a video that was momentarily very blocky when the scene changed, it’s likely because a GOP stretched over the cut.</p>
<p class="indent">There’s also the question of performance, especially if the video is being compressed in real time, as with a live event. There might not be enough time to find the absolute best match for a macroblock in the other frame.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_143"/>Playback quality can vary as well. For example, because of how frames are broken into individually processed macroblocks, seams may appear along the borders of the blocks. To reduce this effect, a decoder may apply a <em>deblocking filter</em>. This smoothes block boundaries by averaging pixel colors, much like the anti-aliasing methods shown in previous chapters. The strength of the filter can be adjusted based on the likelihood of a clean boundary. In a B-Frame, for example, if one block references the previous frame while an adjacent block references the next frame, there’s a greater likelihood of a rough boundary, which calls for stronger filtering.</p>
<p class="indent">In other cases, the resolution of the video and the display resolution may not match. For example, when you’re streaming an episode of the old cop show <em>Adam-12</em> (it’s not just me, right?) on a high-definition television, either the television or the player has to convert the original 640×480 images to fill the 1920×1080 display. This is the same problem we solved in <a href="ch05.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a> with texture mapping—applying a bitmap to a larger area—and video devices can employ the same sorts of techniques. Early high-definition players effectively used nearest-neighbor sampling, which produced poor results. Newer players employ techniques similar to trilinear filtering. Instead of blending between bilinear samples from two different levels in a mipmap, however, they blend between successive frames. This is especially effective in smoothing objects in motion.</p>
<p class="indent">Although not as computationally intense as the original encoding, playing back a temporally compressed video is still a lot of work for a processor. Also, the structure of a GOP requires decoding the frames out of order. This in turn requires that frames be <em>buffered</em>, held in a queue prior to display. For streaming video, much larger buffers are used so that minor hiccups in the network don’t disrupt playback.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec06"><strong>The Present and Future of Video Compression</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">The latest video compression standard, known as H.264 or MPEG-4, extends the techniques used in MPEG-2 but isn’t fundamentally different. The primary differences improve the quality of macroblock matching. Instead of being matched against just one or two other frames, macroblocks can be matched against 32 other frames. Also, the 16×16 macroblocks themselves can be broken down into separately matched 8×8 blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">Through such improvements, MPEG-4 can often achieve twice the compression ratio of MPEG-2 with the same quality result. For that reason, MPEG-4 is an industry standard for both streaming and storage. Most Blu-ray videos use it, as do YouTube and Netflix. Its chief competition is a format called Theora, which uses similar compression methods but is freely licensed, unlike the proprietary MPEG-4.</p>
<p class="indent">Today’s compression formats do an amazing job at shrinking video data, but they do so at a high computational cost. The next time you watch a clip on YouTube, think about a GOP, all the macroblocks being copied and <a id="page_144"/>updated from one frame to the next, and all the number crunching that goes into performing the DCT over and over again. It’s a dizzying amount of calculation just to show a cat falling off a piano.</p>
<p class="indent">Even more computational horsepower will be needed in the future. The new <em>ultra high definition (UHD)</em> format, seen in theaters in films like Peter Jackson’s <em>Hobbit</em> series, is starting to trickle down to home video. UHD images are 3840×2160, which is four times the number of pixels as current high definition. The frame rate will also increase, from today’s 24 or 30 fps to 48, 60, or even 120 fps. UHD video could increase the bit requirements from today’s 1,400Mbps to over 23,000, which will require a corresponding increase in bandwidth and disc storage capacity—unless someone clever comes up with an even better way for software to shrink the data.</p>

<p class="noindent">The previous two chapters were filled with stories of my personal experiences learning, making mistakes, and growing with the manufacturing ecosystem in the greater Shenzhen area. In January 2013, after I’d learned the ropes, the MIT Media Lab asked me to start mentoring graduate students on supply chain and manufacturing, and I took them on a tour of Shenzhen (the same tour where I met Akiba and visited the USB memory stick factory). This chapter is an attempt to distill everything I taught over a course of weeks into a couple dozen pages.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_74"/>The challenges and trade-offs in low-volume manufacturing are different from those of well-funded corporate exercises that prototype at the scale of thousands of units. I learned this over time, but not everyone has six years to bumble through all the newbie mistakes. If you’re already in a fast-moving tech startup, you probably don’t have the luxury of doing any exploration at all. The lessons in this chapter are applicable to anyone looking to bootstrap a hardware product from an initial prototype to moderate volumes (perhaps hundreds of thousands of units). Treat this summary as a general guideline, not a detailed roadmap. The devil is always in the details, and one fun part of making new, innovative hardware products is there’s no end of novel and interesting challenges to be solved.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec34"><strong>HOW TO MAKE A BILL OF MATERIALS</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Most makers trying to scale up their output quickly realize the only practical path forward is to outsource production. If only outsourcing were as easy as schematic + cash = product!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Whether you work with the assembly shop down the street or send your work to China, a clear and complete <em>bill of materials (BOM)</em> is the first step to outsourcing production. Every single assumption you make about your circuit board, down to the color of the soldermask, has to be spelled out unambiguously for a third party to faithfully reproduce your design. Missing or incomplete documentation is the leading cause of production delays, defects, and cost overruns.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec35"><strong>A Simple BOM for a Bicycle Safety Light</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">For a case study, suppose you ran a successful Kickstarter campaign for a bicycle safety light. It contains a circuit that uses a 555 timer to flash a small array of LEDs. After a great marketing campaign, several hundred orders need to be filled in a few months’ time.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_75"/>At first, a BOM for the bicycle light, as automatically generated by a design tool such as Altium, might look like this:</p>&#13;

<p class="tablecap"><em>A very basic bicycle safety light BOM</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This BOM, along with a schematic, is likely sufficient for any graduate of a US electrical engineering program to reproduce the prototype, but it’s far from adequate for a manufacturing cost quotation. This version of the BOM addresses only electronics. A complete BOM for an LED flasher also needs to include the PCB, battery, plastic case pieces, lens, screws, any labeling (like a serial number), a manual, and packaging (plastic bag plus cardboard box, for example). It may also need a master carton to ship multiple LED flashers together, as a single boxed LED flasher is too small to ship on its own. Although cardboard boxes are cheap, they aren’t free, and if they aren’t ordered on time, inventory will sit on the dock until a master carton is delivered for final pack-out prior to shipment.</p>&#13;
<p class="indentb">The following key information is also missing:</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• Approved manufacturer for each component</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• Tolerance, material composition, and voltage specification for passive components</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• Package type information for all parts</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• Extended part numbers specific to each manufacturer</p>&#13;
<p class="indentd">Let’s look at each of the missing items in more detail.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec36"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_76"/><strong>Approved Manufacturers</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">A proper factory will require you to supply an <em>approved vendor list (AVL)</em> specifying the allowed manufacturer(s) for every part on a PCB. A manufacturer is not a distributor but rather the company that actually makes a part. A capacitor, for example, could be made by TDK, Murata, Taiyo Yuden, AVX, Panasonic, Samsung, and so on. I’m still surprised at how many BOMs I’ve reviewed list DigiKey, Mouser, Avnet, or some other distributor as the manufacturer for a part.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">It may seem silly to trifle over who makes a capacitor, but there are definitely situations where the maker of a component matters—even for the humble capacitor. For example, blindly substituting the filter capacitors on a switching regulator, even if the substitute has the same rated capacitance and voltage, can lead to unstable operation and even boards catching fire.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Of course, some parts in a design can be truly insensitive to the manufacturer, in which case I would mark “any/open” on the BOM for the AVL. (This is particularly true for parts like pull-up resistors.) This invites the factory to suggest their preferred supplier on your behalf.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec37"><strong>Tolerance, Composition, and Voltage Specification</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindentab">For passive components marked “any/open,” you should always specify the following key parameters to ensure the right part is purchased:</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• For resistors, specify at minimum the tolerance and wattage. A 1 kΩ, 1 percent tolerance, 1/4 W carbon resistor is a very different beast from a 1 kΩ, 5 percent tolerance, 1 W wire-wound resistor!</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• For capacitors, specify at minimum the tolerance, voltage rating, and dielectric type. For special applications, also specify certain parameters such as ESR or ripple current <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_77"/>tolerance. A 10 μF, electrolytic, 10 percent tolerance capacitor rated for 50V has vastly different performance at high frequencies compared to a 10 μF, ceramic, 20 percent tolerance capacitor rated for 16V.</p>&#13;
<p class="indentd">Inductors are sufficiently specialized that I don’t recommend ever labeling them as “any/open” in your BOM. For power inductors, the basic parameters to specify are core composition, DC resistance, saturation, temperature rise, and current, but unlike resistors and capacitors, inductors have no standard for casing. Furthermore, important parameters such as shielding and potting, which can have material impacts on a circuit’s performance, are often implicit in a part number; hence, it’s best to fully specify the inductor. The same goes for RF inductors.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec38"><strong>Electronic Component Form Factor</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindentb">Always fully specify the <em>form factor</em>, or package type, of a component. Poorly specified or underspecified package parameters can lead to assembly errors. Beyond basic parameters like the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) or JEDEC Solid State Technology Association package code (that is, 0402, 0805, TSSOP, and so on), consider the following package information as you create your BOM:</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Surface mount packages</strong> The height of a component can vary, particularly for packages larger than 1206 or for inductors. Pay attention to whether the board is slotting into a tight case.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Through-hole packages</strong> Always specify lead pitch and component height.</p>&#13;
<p class="indentt">For ICs in general, try to also specify the common name that corresponds to the package, not just the manufacturer’s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_78"/>internal code. For example, a Texas Instruments “DW” type package code corresponds to an SOIC package. This consistency check helps guard against errors.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec39"><strong>Extended Part Numbers</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Designers often think about components in abbreviated part numbers. A great example of this is the 7404. The venerable 7404 is a hex inverter and has been in service for decades. Because of its ubiquity, <em>7404</em> can be used as a generic term for an inverter among design engineers.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When going to production, however, you must specify information like the package type, manufacturer, and logic family. A complete part number for a particular hex inverter might be <strong>74</strong>VHCT<strong>04</strong>AMTC, which specifies an inverter made by Fairchild Semiconductor, from the VHCT series, in a TSSOP package, shipped in tubes. The extra characters are very important, because small variations can cause big problems, such as quoting and ordering the wrong packaged device and being stuck with a reel of unusable parts or subtle reliability problems.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For example, on a robotics controller I designed (codenamed <em>Kovan</em>), I encountered a problem due to a mistaken substitution of <em>VHC</em> in the part number for a component in the <em>VHCT</em> logic family. Using the VHC part switched the input thresholds of the inverter from TTL to CMOS logic-compatible, and some units had an asymmetric response to input signals as a result. Fortunately, I caught this problem before production ramped. The correct part was used on all other units, and I avoided a whole lot of potential rework—or worse, returns from upset customers. Luckily, the only cost of the mistake was reworking the few prototypes I was validating before production.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Here’s another example of how missing a few characters in a part number can cost thousands of dollars. A fully specified <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_79"/>part number for the LM3670 switching regulator might be LM3670MFX-3.3/NOPB. If <em>/NOPB</em> is omitted, the part number is still valid and orderable—but that version uses leaded solder. This could be disastrous for products exporting to a region that requires RoHS compliance (meaning lead-free, among other things), like the European Union.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The <em>X</em> in the part number is another, more subtle issue. Part numbers with an <em>X</em> come in reels of 3,000 pieces, and those lacking an <em>X</em> come in reels of 1,000 pieces. While many factories will question an <em>/NOPB</em> omission since they typically assemble RoHS documentation as they purchase parts, they rarely flag the reel quantity as an issue.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">But <em>you</em> should care about the reel quantity. If you plan to build only 1,000 products, including the <em>X</em> in the part number means you’ll have 2,000 extra LM3670s. And yes, you’re on the hook to pay for the excess, since your BOM specified that part number. There are many valid reasons for ordering excess parts, so factories will rarely question a decision like that.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">On the other hand, parts ordered in lots of 1,000 units are a bit more expensive per unit than those ordered in lots of 3,000. So, if you leave out the <em>X</em> as your volume increases, you’ll end up paying more for the part than you have to. Either way, the factory will quote your BOM exactly as specified, and if your quantity specifiers are incorrect, you could be leaving money on the table—or worse, losing money.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The bottom line? Every digit and character counts, and lack of attention to detail can cost real money!</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec40"><strong>The Bicycle Safety Light BOM Revisited</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">With those four points in mind, consider how a proper, fully specified BOM for the bicycle safety light example might look.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_80"/><img alt="image" src="../images/t0080-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>The improved bicycle safety light BOM</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_81"/>There’s a big difference between a BOM that any engineer could use to produce a prototype, like the first one I showed for the bicycle safety light, and a BOM like this, which any factory could use to mass-produce a product. Notice the MOQ (minimum order quantity) and Lead Time columns in particular. These columns are irrelevant when you’re building low-volume prototypes, as you’d typically buy parts from distributors that have few MOQ restrictions and maintain stock for next-day deliveries. When scaling into production, however, you save a lot of money by cutting the distributor overhead and buying through wholesale channels. In wholesale channels, MOQs and lead times matter.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The good news is that the factory will fill in the MOQ and lead time as part of the quotation process. But you’ll find it helpful to track these parameters from the beginning. If the MOQ of a particular component is very high, the factory may have to buy massive numbers of excess parts, which increases the effective price of the project. If the lead time of a part is very long, you may want to consider redesigning for a part with a shorter lead time. Using parts with shorter lead times not only saves time but also improves cash flow: no one wants to tie up cash on long-lead components four months in advance of sales revenue.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This BOM also includes several nonelectronic items—like the box, a bar code label, and so on—which wouldn’t be on the engineering prototype’s BOM. These miscellaneous bits are easy to forget, but a missing user manual in an initial BOM is often not discovered until the final sample is opened for approval, leading to a last-minute scramble to get the manual into the final product. Many products have been delayed simply because a user manual or box art wasn’t completed and approved in time, and it sucks to have a hundred thousand dollars’ worth of inventory idling in a warehouse for want of a slip of paper.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_82"/>Beyond a proper BOM, providing the factory with golden samples of your product along with your CAD files is another best practice. These working prototypes enable the factory to make smarter decisions about any ambiguities in your submitted BOM. Hand-soldering one more unit just for the factory may seem annoying, but in my opinion, a few hours of soldering beats a week of trading emails with the factory.</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong>NOTE</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>When you’re building a business model, parts and packaging still aren’t the only costs to consider. Even this detailed BOM doesn’t list factory margin, labor for assembly, pack-out, shipping, duties, and so on. I discuss these “soft costs” in “<a href="ch03.xhtml#ch00lev1sec58">Picking (and Maintaining) a Partner</a>” on <a href="ch03.xhtml#page_107">page 107</a>.</em></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec41"><strong>Planning for and Coping with Change</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Of course, even if your design is perfect and your BOM is ideal, your design may still have to change if vendors <em>end-of-life (EOL)</em>, or stop making, components you selected. And let’s face it: there’s always a chance your design assumptions won’t survive contact with real consumers, too.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Before crossing the threshold into production, formalize the process for changing a design with the factory. It’s best practice to use written, formal <em>engineering change orders (ECO)</em> to update the factory on any changes after the initial quotation. At minimum, here’s what an ECO template should include:</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• The details of each changed part, and a brief explanation of why the change is needed</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• A unique revision number for conveniently referencing the change down the road</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• A method to record the factory’s receipt of the ECO paperwork</p>&#13;
<p class="indentd"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_83"/>Be thorough with ECOs, rather than relying on casual emails, or the buyers at your factory may buy the wrong part. Worse yet, the factory might <em>install</em> the wrong part, and entire lots of your product will need to be scrapped or reworked. Even after troubleshooting a problem with the factory engineers, I still write up a formal ECO and submit it to the production staff to formalize the findings. I hate paperwork as much as the next engineer, but in production, one small mistake can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and that thought keeps me disciplined on ECOs.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">On the next page is an actual ECO I issued that ended up saving me time and money.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Note the date on this ECO: February 27, 2014. This ECO was issued right before the Chinese New Year, when the factories go on holiday for a couple of weeks. There is significant turnover of unskilled labor inside factories after the holidays, and thus there’s a lot of opportunity for work orders to get lost and forgotten. Worried that the ECO would be missed, I consulted with the managers after the factory resumed production to ensure the ECO wasn’t forgotten. They assured me it was applied, but I still felt a vague paranoia, so I asked for photos of the circuit board to confirm. Sure enough, the first production batch was missing the change in my ECO.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Thanks to the detailed ECO, the factory readily admitted its error, repaired the entire production run, and paid for the reworking. But if I’d sent the change order in a quick email without referencing specific batches or work orders, there could have been sufficient ambiguity for the factory to get out of the rework charges. The factory could have argued that it thought I meant to apply the change to a future production run, or it could simply deny receiving a confirmed order, as emails are a fairly casual form of communication. Either way, a few minutes of documentation saved days of negotiation and hundreds of dollars in rework fees.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_84"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f0084-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>Example of an actual ECO used in production. Thanks to the formal documentation process, a production mix-up related to this ECO was resolved in my favor.</em></p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec42"><strong>PROCESS OPTIMIZATION: DESIGN FOR MANUFACTURING</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">While you’re designing your final product and putting together a BOM, considering <em>yield</em>, the number of good units that come out of the manufacturing process, is also important. Yield is a boring subject for many engineers, but for entrepreneurs, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_85"/>success or failure will be determined in part by whether they achieve a reasonable yield. Fortunately, you can help your yield by designing with it in mind.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec43"><strong>Why DFM?</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Unlike software, every copy of a physical good has slight imperfections. Sometimes the imperfections cancel out; sometimes, they gang up and degrade performance. As production volume ramps, a fraction of the product always ends up nonsalable. In a robust design, the failing fraction may be so small that functional tests can be simplified, leading to further cost reductions. In contrast, designs sensitive to component tolerances require extensive testing and will suffer heavy yield losses. Reworking defective units incurs extra labor and parts charges, ultimately eroding profits.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Thus, redesigning to improve robustness in the face of normal manufacturing tolerances is a major challenge of moving from the engineering bench to mass production. This process is called <em>design for manufacturing (DFM)</em>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0085-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>Left, before DFM, almost half the units are not meeting the acceptance level and are therefore failing. Right, after DFM, the acceptance level is the same, but the average performance is improved, leading to most units passing</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To understand the importance of DFM, consider these graphs. Each depicts a <em>bell curve</em>, which is an assumed statistical distribution of a particular parameter. The x-axis is a parameter of interest, and the y-axis is the number of items produced that hit the given parameter. For example, in a plot <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_86"/>of the brightness of thousands of LEDs, the x-axis would be brightness, and the y-axis would be the number of LEDs that reach a given brightness. The position of the bell curve relative to the pass/fail criteria determines the net production yield.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">On the right-hand curve, most LEDs are bright enough, and most of the production inventory is shippable. On the left-hand curve, maybe 40 percent of the LEDs pass. Given that most hardware companies operate with about a 30 to 50 percent gross margin, scrapping 40 percent of the material would mean the end of the business. In such a situation, the only viable options are to spend the time and effort to rework the LEDs until they pass or to lower the performance requirement. The product wouldn’t be as high quality as hoped, but at least the business could keep operating.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec44"><strong>Tolerances to Consider</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">The goal of DFM is to ensure that your product always passes muster and that you’re never faced with the unsavory choice of reducing margins, lowering quality standards, or going out of business. But there are some component aspects to think about when applying DFM.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev1sec45">ELECTRONIC TOLERANCES</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Passive component tolerances are the most obvious tolerances to design for. If a resistor’s true value can be +/-5 percent of its labeled value, be sure the rest of your circuit can cope with the edge cases.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Active component datasheet parameters—like current gain (hFE) for bipolar transistors, threshold voltage (V<sub>t</sub>) for field effect transistors (FETs), and forward bias voltage (V<sub>f</sub>) for LEDs—can also vary widely. Always read the datasheet, and watch for parameters with a great disparity between their minimum and maximum values, a difference often referred to as a <em>min-max spread</em>. For example, the min-max on hFE <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_87"/>for Fairchild’s 2N3904 ranges from 40 to 300, and the V<sub>f</sub> on a superbright LED from Kingbright is between 2 and 2.5V.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Nominal operating voltage aside, a component’s maximum voltage rating is particularly important for capacitors and input networks. I try to use capacitors rated for twice the nominal voltage; for example, where possible, I use 10V capacitors for 5V rails and 6.3V capacitors for 3.3V rails. To understand why, consider ceramic capacitor dielectrics, which have reduced capacitance with increasing voltage. In designs operating near a ceramic capacitor’s maximum voltage, that component’s operating capacitance will be at the negative end of its tolerance range. Also, <em>input networks</em> (any part of the circuit that a user can plug something into) are subject to punishing electrostatic discharge and other transient abuses, so pay special attention to the ratings of capacitors there to achieve your desired reliability.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Finally, after you have a good sense of the components you’ll use, pay close attention to trace widths and layer stack variations when designing your PCB. These will impact systems that require matched impedance or deal with high currents.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev1sec46">MECHANICAL TOLERANCES</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Electronic tolerances aren’t the end of your worries, though; mechanical tolerances are important, too. Neither PCBs nor cases will come out exactly the right size, so design your case with some wiggle room. If your case design has zero tolerance for the PCB dimensions, half the time the factory will force PCBs into cases, when either the PCB is cut a little large or the case comes out a little small. This can cause unintentional mechanical damage to the circuitry or the case.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">And don’t forget about cosmetic blemishes! Any manufactured product is subject to small blemishes, such as dust trapped in plastics, small scratches, sink marks, and abrasions. It’s important to work out the acceptance criteria for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_88"/>such defects with the factory ahead of time. For example, you might tell the factory that a unit can be considered “good” if it has no more than two dot blemishes larger than 0.2mm, no scratch longer than 0.3mm, and so on. Most factories will have a particular system they’ve adopted to describe and enforce these standards. If you discuss these parameters in advance, the factory can craft the manufacturing process to avoid such defects, as opposed to the more expensive alternative of building extra units and throwing away those that don’t meet criteria imposed late in the game.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Of course, avoiding defects isn’t free. To keep your product cheaper, avoid high-gloss finishes and consider using matte or textured finishes that naturally hide blemishes.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec47"><strong>Following DFM Helps Your Bottom Line</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">To imagine DFM in a real-world scenario, return to the bicycle safety flasher case study from “<a href="ch03.xhtml#ch00lev1sec34">How to Make a Bill of Materials</a>” on <a href="ch03.xhtml#page_74">page 74</a>. Say the prototype design calls for an array of three LEDs in parallel, each with its own resistor to set the current. The <em>forward bias voltage</em>, or <em>V<sub>f</sub></em>, of an LED at a given brightness can vary by perhaps 20 percent between devices; in this case, that swing is from 2.0 to 2.5V.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A design that limits the current to the LEDs with resistors, called <em>resistive current limiting</em>, will amplify this variation. This happens because an efficient circuit would drop a minority of the voltage across the current-limiting resistor, leaving the parameter that sets the current (the voltage drop across the resistor) more sensitive to the variation in V<sub>f</sub>. Since the brightness of an LED is not proportional to the voltage but rather the current flowing through it, setting the LED brightness with resistive current limiting can cause jarring inconsistencies in LED brightness.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">In this example, a 20 percent LED V<sub>f</sub> variation (from 2.0V to 2.5V, per the LED manufacturer’s specification) leads to a 40 percent change in the voltage across a current-set resistor for a fixed 3.3V supply. This will cause a 40 percent change in the current flowing through the LED. As brightness is directly proportional to current, the change manifests as up to a 40 percent variation in perceived brightness between individual LEDs. A design like that may work well most of the time; the problem would only be pronounced when a high V<sub>f</sub> unit is observed next to a low V<sub>f</sub> unit.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0089-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>Setting current for individual LEDs using resistors can lead to dramatic variations in brightness.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_90"/>The one or two units prepared on the lab bench during development may have looked great, but in production a meaningful fraction may have such serious brightness uniformity issues that units must be rejected. As most large hardware businesses have to survive on lean margins, losing even 10 percent of finished goods to defects is a terrible outcome.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">One stop-gap option is to rework the failed units. A factory can identify an LED that is too dim or too bright in an array and replace it with one that better matches its cohorts. But that rework would drive up costs and result in an unexpected and unpleasant invoice at the 11th hour of a manufacturing program. Naive designers may be inclined to blame the factory for poor quality and argue over who should bear the cost, but it’s better to proactively avoid these kinds of problems by subjecting every design to a DFM check and using a small pilot run to sanity-check yield before punching out a whole bunch of units.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The cost of yield fallout quantifies how much money to spend on extra circuitry to compensate for normal component variability. For example, a product with a $10 <em>cost of goods sold (COGS)</em> that yields 80 percent good units has an effective cost per salable unit of $12.50, as calculated with this formula:</p>&#13;
<p class="indent2">Effective cost = COGS × total units built / yielded units</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Increasing the COGS by $2.50 to improve yield to 100 percent would allow you to break even. But using the same formula, spending $1 extra dollar in COGS to improve yield to 99 percent would actually improve the bottom line by $1.38.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_91"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f0091-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>A circuit to set the current on three LEDs, created by applying DFM</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the case of the bicycle safety light, that dollar could be spent on a current-feedback boost regulator IC like the SP6699EK-L/TR, allowing the LEDs to be stacked in series instead of parallel. The design would be far more complicated and expensive than using individual resistors, but it would guarantee each LED has a consistent, identical current flowing through it by driving all three LEDs in a series circuit with a fixed-current feedback loop. That would virtually eliminate brightness variation. While the cost of the boost regulator is much greater than the penny spent on three current-limiting LEDs, the improvement in manufacturing yield more than pays for the extra component costs. In fact, this trick is standard practice for applications that require good uniformity of brightness out of LEDs, such as in the backlights of LCD panels. A typical mobile phone backlight uses about a dozen LEDs, but, thanks to circuits like this, you never see light or dark splotches despite the large variations in V<sub>f</sub> between the constituent LEDs.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec48"><strong>The Product Behind Your Product</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Alongside dealing with tolerances, another often-neglected design responsibility is the test program. A factory can only detect the problems it is instructed to look for. Therefore, every <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_92"/>feature of a product must be tested, no matter how trivial. For example, on a chumby device, every user-facing feature had an explicit factory test, including the LCD, touchscreen, audio, microphone, all the expansion ports (USB, audio), battery, buttons, knobs, and so on. I made sure that even the simplest buttons were tested. While it’s tempting to skip testing such simple components, I guarantee that anything not tested will lead to returns.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I like to call the factory tester “<a href="ch03.xhtml#ch00lev1sec48">the product behind your product.</a>” That’s because in some cases, the factory tester is more complicated and more difficult to engineer than the product you’re trying to sell. This is particularly true of simple products.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev1sec49">A REAL-WORLD TEST PROGRAM</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">As a case study, consider this microcontroller sticker from Chibitronics, a project I discuss at length in <a href="ch08.xhtml#ch08">Chapter 8</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0092-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>A microcontroller circuit—on a sticker</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This circuit is very simple: it consists of just an 8-bit AVR microcontroller and a handful of resistors and capacitors. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_93"/>(It’s also the same product referred to in the ECO example on <a href="ch03.xhtml#page_84">page 84</a>.) My collaborator and I sketched in Adobe Illustrator for about two days before we derived the final shape for this product. Then we spent about a day in Altium designing the circuit, and about a week coding in the Arduino IDE to create its firmware. In all, the development process took about two weeks. For production, the microcontroller is paired with a set of sensors that can process sound, light, and touch, and as a result, the test program runs on all four at the same time.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0093-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>The testing machine for the Chibitronics microcontroller sticker</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The test rig pictured consists of a 32-bit ARM computer running Linux with a graphical UI rendered on an HDMI monitor. Behind this is an FPGA, some adapter electronics to create analog waveforms for testing, and a mechanical pogo-pin <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_94"/>assembly for touching down on the sticker. Breaking down the design process for this rig into its component parts, we spent:</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• Several days designing in Altium</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• A week programming in the Xilinx ISE for the FPGA</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• A couple of weeks hacking on Linux drivers</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• A couple of solid months hacking in C++, to create the Qt integration framework</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• A couple of days in SolidWorks, to create the mechanical apparatus to hold the whole thing together</p>&#13;
<p class="indentd">Altogether, creating the tester for the microcontroller sticker took over two months, compared to the two weeks to create the product itself.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Why go through all this effort? Because time is money, and defects and returns are expensive to process. The tester can process one board in under 30 seconds; and in those 30 seconds, the tester has to program two microcontrollers; test sensors for light, sound, and touch; and confirm operation at both 5V and 3V. A manual test for all these operations could take several minutes of skilled labor and wouldn’t be as reliable. Thanks to this tester, we processed zero returns due to defective material. Also, the graphical UI on the tester makes it very easy for the factory to determine exactly which point in the circuit is failing, facilitating fast rework of any imperfect material.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev1sec50">GUIDELINES FOR CREATING A TEST PROGRAM</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">As a rule of thumb, for every product you make, you’re actually making two related products: one for the end user, and a test for the factory. In many ways, the test for the factory has to be as user-friendly and foolproof as the product itself; after all, tests are not run by electrical engineers. But the related testing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_95"/>product will be much quicker and faster to build if adequate testing features are designed into the consumer product.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">And no, don’t outsource the test program to the factory, even if the factory offers that service. The factory often won’t understand your design intent, so their test programs will either be inefficient or test for the wrong behavior. Factories also have an incentive to pass as much material as possible, as quickly as possible, so their test programs tend to be primitive and inadequate.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Here are some guidelines to follow when designing your own program:</p>&#13;
<p class="term"><strong>Strive for 100 percent feature coverage.</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="termp">Don’t overlook simple or secondary features like status LEDs or an internal voltage sensor. When creating the test list, I take an “outside/inside” approach. First, look at the product from the outside: list every way a consumer can interact with it. Does your test program address every interaction surface, even if only superficially? Is every LED lit, every button pressed, every sensor stimulated, and every memory device touched? Has every bullet point in your marketing material been confirmed? Promising “world-class” RF sensitivity is different from simply advertising the presence of a radio. Then, think about the inside: from the schematic, look at every port and consider key internal nodes to monitor. If the product has a microcontroller, review which drivers are loaded to cross-check the test list, and make sure no components are forgotten.</p>&#13;
<p class="term"><strong>Minimize incremental setup effort.</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="termp">Optimize the amount of time required to set up the test for each unit. This is often done through jigs that employ pogo pins or prealigned connector arrays. A test that requires an operator to manually probe a dozen test points with a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_96"/>multimeter or insert a dozen connectors is time-consuming and error-prone. Most factories in China can help design the jig for a nominal cost, but jig design is easier and more effective if the design itself already includes adequate test points.</p>&#13;
<p class="term"><strong>Automate test procedure into a linear flow.</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="termp">An ideal test runs with a single button press, and produces a pass or fail result. In practice, there are always stop points that require operator intervention, but try not to require too much. For example, don’t require an operator to key in or select an SSID from a list during each Wi-Fi connectivity test. Instead, fix the test target’s SSID and hardcode that value into a test script so the connection cycle is automatic.</p>&#13;
<p class="term"><strong>Use icons and colors, not text, to communicate with operators.</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="termp">Not every operator is guaranteed to be literate in a given language.</p>&#13;
<p class="term"><strong>Employ audit logs.</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="termp">Record test results correlated to device serial numbers by incorporating a barcode scanner into the test rig. Alternatively, have the device print a coupon with a unique, timestamped code or a locally stored audit log to prove which units passed a test. Logs will help you figure out what went wrong when a consumer returns a failed product, and they let you quickly check that all products were tested. After an eight-hour shift of testing, an operator may make mistakes, such as accidentally putting a defective unit into the “good” bin. Being able to check that every shipped product was subjected to and passed the full test can help you identify and isolate such problems.</p>&#13;
<p class="term"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_97"/><strong>Provide an easy update mechanism.</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="termp">Like any program, test programs have bugs. Tests also need to evolve as your product is patched and upgraded. Have a mechanism to update and fix test programs without visiting the factory in person. Many of my test fixtures can “phone home” via a VPN, and I can SSH into the jig itself to fix bugs. Even my simplest jig employs a Linux laptop (or equivalent) at its core. This is in part because Linux is easier to update and maintain than a bespoke microcontroller that requires a special adapter for firmware updates.</p>&#13;
<p class="indentd">These guidelines are easy to implement if your product is designed with testability in mind. Most of the products I design run Linux, and I leverage the processor inside the product itself to run most tests and help manage the test user interface. For products that lack user interaction surfaces, an Android phone or a laptop connected via Wi-Fi or serial can be used to render the test user interface.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec51"><strong>Testing vs. Validation</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Production tests are meant to check for assembly errors, not parametric variations or design issues. If a test is screening out devices because of normal parametric component variations, either buy better components or redo your design.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For consumer-grade products, you don’t need to run a five-minute comprehensive RAM test on every unit. In theory, your product should be designed well enough that if it’s all soldered together correctly, the RAM will do its job. A quick test to check that there are no stuck or open address pins is often enough. Name-brand chip vendors typically have very low defectivity, so you’re not validating the silicon; rather, you’re validating the solder joints and connectors and checking for missing or swapped components. (But if you buy clone <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_98"/>chips or off-brand, remarked, or partially tested devices to cut costs, I recommend making a mini validation program for those components.)</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev1sec52">VALIDATING A SWITCH</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">To illustrate the difference between production testing and validation, let’s look at how both might work for a switch.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A production test for a switch may simply ask the operator to hit the switch a few times and verify that the feel is right, and that electrical contact is made through a simple digital indicator. A validation test, on the other hand, may involve selecting a few devices at random, measuring the switch contact resistance with a multimeter that is accurate to five significant digits (also called a <em>five-digit multimeter</em>), subjecting the devices to elevated humidity and temperature for a couple of days, and then putting the devices into an automated jig that cycles the switches 10,000 times. Finally, you might remeasure the switch contact resistance with a five-digit multimeter and note any degradation in close-state contact resistance.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Clearly, this level of validation can’t be performed on every device manufactured. Rather, the validation program evaluates the switch’s performance over the expected lifetime of the product. The production test, on the other hand, just makes sure the switch is put together right.</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong>NOTE</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>It’s good practice to rerun validation tests on a couple of randomly sampled units out of every several thousand units produced. There are formulas and tables you can use to compute how much sampling you need to achieve a certain level of quality; just search online for “manufacturing validation test table.”</em></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">But how much testing is enough? You can derive one threshold for testing through a cost argument. Every additional test run incurs equipment costs, engineering costs, and the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_99"/>variable cost of the test time. As a result, testing is subject to diminishing returns: at some point, it’s cheaper just to take a product return than to test more. Naturally, the testing bar is much higher for medical or industrial-grade equipment, as the liability associated with faulty equipment is also much higher. Likewise, a novelty product meant to be given away may need much less testing.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev1sec53">DESIGNING YOUR TEST JIG</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">A final thought: always apply solid engineering to your test jig design. When I worked on the chumby 8, there was a problem where a 50-pin flat flex cable adapter was exhibiting random cold-solder-joint failures. I asked the factory to build a test to validate the adapters. Their solution was to hang LEDs from every pin of the adapter, apply a test voltage to one side of the cable, and look for LEDs that didn’t light on the other side. The cold solder joints weren’t simply open or closed; some just had high resistance. Enough current would flow to light an LED, yet there was also enough resistance to cause a fault in the design.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The factory proposed buying 50 multimeters and attaching them to every pin to check the resistance manually, which would have been expensive and error-prone. It’s not reasonable to expect an operator to look at 50 displays hundreds of times a day and be able to reliably find the out-of-spec numbers. Instead, I chose to daisy-chain the connections across the adapter and use a single multimeter to check the net resistance of the daisy chain. By putting the connections in series, I could check all 50 connections with a single numeric measurement, as opposed to the subjective observation of an LED’s brightness.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As this case illustrates, there are good and bad ways to implement even a test as simple as checking for cold solder joints on a cable adapter. Ever more complicated components <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_100"/>require ever more subtle tests, and there’s real value in using engineering skills to craft efficient yet foolproof tests.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec54"><strong>FINDING BALANCE IN INDUSTRIAL DESIGN</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Even if your product passes all validation tests with flying colors, it still may not be successful if consumers don’t want it. Remember: sex sells. To within a factor of two or so, the performance of a CPU or amount of RAM in a box is less important to a typical consumer than how the device looks. Apple devices command a hefty premium in part because of their slick industrial design, and many product designers aim to emulate the success of Sir Jonathan Ive, Apple’s chief design officer, in their own products.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">There are many schools of thought in <em>industrial design</em>, the process of designing how a product will look before actually making it. One school invokes the monastic designer, who creates a beautiful, pure concept, and the production engineers, who spoil the design’s purity when they tweak it for functionality. Another school invokes the pragmatic designer, who works closely with production engineers to hammer out gritty compromises to produce an inexpensive and high-yielding design.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In my experience, neither extreme is compelling. The monastic approach often results in an unmanufacturable product that is either late to market or expensive to produce. The pragmatist approach often results in a product that looks and feels so cheap that consumers have trouble assigning it a significant value. The real trick is understanding how to strike a balance between the two, and it begins by getting into the factory and understanding how things are done. Here’s a couple of examples of what I’ve learned about how different factory processes affect that balance, from Chumby and Arduino.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec55"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_101"/><strong>The chumby One’s Trim and Finish</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Trim and finish are difficult, making them points of distinction in a product’s appearance. When I worked at Chumby, we wanted the final product to have a minimalist, honest finish. (<em>Honest finishes</em> feature the natural properties of the material systems in play and eschew the use of paints and decals.) Minimalist designs are very hard to manufacture because with fewer features, even tiny blemishes stand out. Honest finishes can be difficult, too, as all the burs, gates, sinks, knits, scoring, and flow lines that are facts of life in manufacturing are laid naked before the consumer. As a result, this school of design requires well-made manufacturing tools that are constantly checked and maintained throughout production.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you don’t have pockets deep enough to invest in new equipment and capabilities on behalf of your factory (that is, if you’re not a <em>Fortune</em> 500 company), the first step is to learn the vocabulary available. A <em>design vocabulary</em> is defined by the capabilities of the factory or factories producing the goods, like what materials you can obtain, what finish is possible, what tolerances are achievable, and what fastening technology exists. These are all heavily dependent upon the processes available to your factory.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Therefore, I find that visiting a factory in person early in the design process results in a better design. After a factory visit, you’ll discard some design vocabulary, but you’ll discover some new vocabulary as well. The engineers who work in the factory day in and day out develop process innovations that can open up novel design possibilities that you won’t discover unless you visit.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The chumby One is a concrete example of the impact manufacturing processes can have on design outcome. In the original concept art, a blue highlight was added around the front edge to resemble a speech balloon, like those used in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_102"/>comic strips. The idea was that the chumby would caption your world with snippets from the internet.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0102-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>A finished chumby One unit</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">But applying a blue trim across a raised surface was very hard. The first factory used paint, because the front edge wasn’t flat enough to make silk screening an option. <em>Pad printing</em> (also known as <em>tampo printing</em>, a process in which ink is transferred from a silicone pad to an object) can handle curved surfaces, but the alignment of the ridge on the chumby One wasn’t good enough, and the tiniest ink bleed over the edge looked terrible from the side. Decals and stickers likewise couldn’t achieve the alignment we wanted. In the end, a small channel was carved to contain the paint, and the factory created the highlight with a stencil and spray paint.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The yield was terrible. In some lots, over 40 percent of the chumby One cases were thrown away due to painting errors. Fortunately, plastic is cheap, so throwing away every other case after painting had a net cost impact of about $0.35.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_103"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f0103-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>Two chumby One units with bad paint jobs</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Midway through production, we started producing chumby One units in a second-source facility. The second factory had different plastic molding equipment, and unlike the first factory, this facility could do <em>double-shot molds</em>. A double-shot mold involves twice the number of tools of a single-shot injection mold, but it can injection-mold two different colors, or even two different materials, into the same mold. At the new factory, we tried a double-shot process instead of painting for the thin blue strip.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0103-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>A perfect chumby One ridge, from the double-injection mold process</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_104"/>The results were stunning. Every unit came off the line with a crisp blue line, and no paint meant a cleaner, more honest finish. But the cost per case jumped to $0.94 apiece with the more expensive process, despite the 100 percent yield. It would have been cheaper to throw away more than half of the painted cases, but even the best painted cases could not compare to the quality of the finish delivered by the double-shot tool.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec56"><strong>The Arduino Uno’s Silkscreen Art</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Another great example of how tweaking a factory process can improve a product’s appearance is the Arduino motherboard. The wonderfully detailed artwork on the back side, sporting an outline of Italy and very fine lettering, isn’t silkscreen. The factory that makes these boards actually puts on two layers of soldermask: one blue and one white.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0104-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="cap"><em>The underside of an Arduino Uno R3</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When Arduino boards are manufactured, soldermask is applied through the photolithographic process I described in “<a href="ch02.xhtml#ch00lev1sec19">Where Arduinos Are Born</a>” on <a href="ch02.xhtml#page_44">page 44</a>. This process results in artwork with much better resolution, consistency, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_105"/>and alignment than a silkscreen. And since an Arduino’s look is the circuit board, this art gives the product a distinctive, high-quality appearance that is difficult to copy using conventional processing methods.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Thus, the process capability of a factory (whether it’s painting versus double-shot molding, or double soldermasking versus silkscreening) can have a real effect on a product’s perceived quality, without a huge impact on cost. The factory, however, may not appreciate the full potential of its processes, and until a designer interacts with the facility directly, your product can’t harness that potential, either.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Unfortunately, many designers don’t visit a factory until something has gone wrong. At that point, the tools are cut, and even if you discover a cool process that could solve all your problems, it’s often too late.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec57"><strong>My Design Process</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Design is an intensely personal activity, and as a result, every designer will develop their own process. If you need a framework for developing your own, however, this is the general process I might use to develop a product on a tight, startup budget:</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li><p class="no">Start with a sketchbook. Decide on the soul and identity of the design, and pick a material system and vocabulary that suits your concept. But don’t fall in love with it, because it may have to change.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="no">Break down the design by material system, and identify a factory capable of producing each material system.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="no">Visit the facility, and note what is actually running down the production lines. Don’t assume anything based on the one-off units from the sample room. Practice makes perfect, and from the operators to the engineers, factory workers execute procedures they do daily much better than they would an arcane capability they don’t use often.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="no"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_106"/>Reevaluate your design based on a new understanding of what’s possible at the factory, and iterate. Go back to step 1 if small tweaks aren’t enough. This is the stage when it’s easiest to make compromises without sacrificing the purity of your design.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="no">Rough out the details of your design. Pick sliding surfaces, parting lines where pieces of the case snap together, finishes, fastening systems, and so on based on what the factory can do best.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="no">Pass a revised drawing to the factory, and work with them to finalize details such as draft angles, fastening surfaces, internal ribbing, and so on.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="no">Validate the design using a 3D print and extensive 3D model checks.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="no">Identify features prone to tolerance errors, and trim the initial manufacturing tool so that the tolerance favors modifications that will help you minimize costly changes to the tool. For example, consider injection molding, where a steel tool is the negative of the plastic it’s molding. Removing steel from a tool (adding plastic) is easier than adding steel (removing plastic), so target the initial test shot to use more steel on critical dimensions, as opposed to too little. A button is one mechanism that benefits from tuning like this: predicting exactly how a button will feel from CAD or 3D prints is hard, and perfecting the tactile feel usually requires a little trimming of the tool.</p></li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<p class="indentd">Of course, this process isn’t a set of hard rules to follow. You may need to add or repeat steps based on your experience with your factory, but if you choose a good factory, this should be a good starting point.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec58"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_107"/><strong>PICKING (AND MAINTAINING) A PARTNER</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Just like the wands from <em>Harry Potter</em>, a good factory chooses you as much as you choose it, so forget the term <em>vendor</em> and replace it with <em>partner</em>. If you’re doing it right, you aren’t simply instructing the factory; there should be a frank dialogue about the trade-offs involved and how the manufacturing process can be improved. That’s the only way to get the best product possible.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A healthy relationship with a factory can also lead to better payment terms, which improves your cash flow. In some cases, factory credit can directly replace raising venture capital, taking loans, or getting Kickstarter funding. As a result, I treat good factories with the same respect as investors and partners in a business. For an idea of what that means, here are some tips on how to choose and work with your factory.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec59"><strong>Tips for Forming a Relationship with a Factory</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">First, pick the right-sized factory for your product. If you work with a factory that’s too big, you risk getting lost in bureaucracy and pushed out of the production line by bigger customers at critical times. Work with a factory too small, and it won’t be able to provide the services you need. As a rule, I pick the biggest facility where I can get direct access to the <em>lao ban</em> (factory boss) on a regular basis, because if you can’t talk to the boss, you’re nobody. It’s a good sign if the lao ban is there on the first meeting to give you a tour and asks astute questions about your business over lunch.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Second, follow the adage “Sunlight is the best disinfectant.” If a factory won’t quote with an open BOM, where the cost of every component, process, and margin is explicitly disclosed, I won’t work with them. Cost reduction discussions cannot <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_108"/>function without transparency, because there are too many places to bury costs otherwise. Likewise, if cost discussions turn into a game of whack-a-mole, where reduced costs on one line item are inexplicably popping up in another, run away.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This final tip applies primarily to startups. In your early stages, everyone knows your cash supplies are finite. Even if you’ve just closed a big round of financing, swaggering into a factory with money bags is not a sustainable approach. Smart factories know your cash supplies are limited, and if the greatest value you propose to bring to the factory is piles of money, your value is limited; in the best case, it won’t really pay out until years down the road when the product is shipping in high volumes. As a result, it’s helpful to try to deliver value to the factory in nonmonetary ways.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As silly as it sounds, being a pleasant and constructive person goes a long way in currying the favor of your facility. Manufacturing is a high-stress, low-margin business, and everyone in the facility has to deal with difficult problems all day. I find I get better service—even better than customers with deeper pockets—if I treat my factories as I would treat a friendly acquaintance, and not as slave labor or a mere subcontractor. Mistakes happen, and being able to turn a bad situation into a learning experience will benefit you on the day you make a stupid (and perhaps expensive) mistake.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec60"><strong>Tips on Quotations</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Openness aside, know that if a quote seems too good to be true, it often is. When negotiating prices with a factory, step back and check if the quote makes sense. Factories that lose money on a deal will stop at nothing to make it back, and many manufacturing horror stories have roots in unhealthy cost structures. A factory’s first prerogative is survival, even if that means mixing defective units into lots to boost <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_109"/>margin, or assigning novice engineers to a flagging project to better monetize their seasoned engineers on more profitable customers.</p>&#13;
<p class="indentb">As you evaluate a quote, make sure it includes the following:</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• The price of each part</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• The excess material for the job due to <em>minimum order quantities (MOQs)</em></p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• Labor costs</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• The factory’s overhead cost</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• <em>Nonrecurring engineering (NRE)</em> fees</p>&#13;
<p class="indentd">Let’s look at a few of these items in detail.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev1sec61">KEEPING AN EYE ON EXCESS</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindenta"><em>Excess</em> is the result of what I call the “hot dogs and buns” problem. Hot dogs come in packs of 10, but buns come in packs of 8. Unless you buy 40 servings, you’ll have leftover buns or hot dogs.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Likewise, many components only come in 3,000-piece reels. A 10,000-piece build requires 4 reels for a total of 12,000 pieces, leaving 2,000 pieces of excess. Factories can buy parts in cut tape or partial reels, but the cost per part of cut tape is much higher, as the risk of excess material is shifted onto the distributor.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Excess isn’t all bad, though: it can be folded into future runs of a product. As long as your product sustains a decent production rate, excess component inventory should turn into cash on a regular basis. At some point, however, production will end or pause, and the bill for the excess will arrive, putting a crimp on cash flow. If a quote lacks an excess column, the factory may charge you for the full reel but keep the excess for their own purposes; this is where many of the gray-market <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_110"/>goods in Shenzhen come from. They may also just send an unexpected invoice for it down the road, which often arrives at the worst possible time—revenue from the product has already ceased, but bills keep coming in. Either way, it’s best to know up front the complete cradle-to-grave business model.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev1sec62">FIGURING OUT LABOR COSTS</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Labor costs are devilishly tricky to estimate, but the good news is that for high-tech assemblies, labor is typically a small fraction of total cost. The labor cost of assembling small volumes of a straightforward board with 200 parts may be about $2 or $3 in China, while the cost of assembling in the United States is closer to $20 or $30. Even if labor prices double overnight in China and halve in the United States, China may still be competitive.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This is in contrast to the lower-value goods moving out of China (such as textiles), where the base value of the raw material is already low, so labor costs are a significant portion of the final product cost. I usually don’t argue much over labor costs, since the end result of scrimping on labor is often lowered quality, and pushing too hard on labor costs can force the factory to reduce the workers’ quality of life by trimming benefits.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev1sec63">THE FACTORY’S OVERHEAD</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Negotiating factory margin is also a bit of an art, and there are no hard-and-fast rules. I’ll give guidance here, but there are always exceptions to the rule, and every factory can cut you a special deal depending on the circumstances. Ultimately, it’s important to look at the big picture when reviewing a factory’s quote and use some common sense.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">What constitutes a fair margin for a factory depends on how much value it adds to your product, and the volume of production. The definition of “margin” also varies depending on the facility. Some facilities include scrap, handling overhead, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_111"/>and even research and development expenses in the margin, while others may break those out on separate lines.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In general, margin ranges between single-digit and low double-digit percentages, depending upon volume, value add, and project complexity. For very low-quantity production lots (fewer than 1,000 pieces), you may also be charged a per-lot <em>line fee</em>. This fee partially defrays the cost of setting up an assembly line only to tear it down after a couple of hours. A line’s throughput may be very fast, producing hundreds to thousands of units a day, but it also takes days to set up.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev1sec64">NONRECURRING ENGINEERING COSTS</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">NRE costs are onetime fees required to set up a production run, such a stencils, SMT programming, jigs, and test equipment. Note that reusing test equipment between customers is considered bad practice; if a multimeter is required as part of a production test, don’t be surprised if a bill for a multimeter is tacked onto the NRE. Customers have drastically varying standards around the maintenance and use of test equipment, so good factories don’t take chances with it.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec65"><strong>Miscellaneous Advice</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Who you can talk to and how open the factory is about costs are certainly key concerns, but with experience, you’ll learn a lot more about dealing with factories that doesn’t fall into any particular category. To close, here are a few more important points to keep in mind when selecting a factory.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev1sec66">SCRAP AND YIELD</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Ideally, you’d pay a factory only for good, delivered items, and the factory would bear the burden of defective units. This gives the factory an incentive to maintain a high production quality, because every percent of defectiveness eats away at its margin. But if your design has a flaw or is too hard to build, and defectiveness is high, the factory may start shipping <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_112"/>lower-quality units as a desperate measure to meet production and margin targets. It may also start selling defective goods on the gray market to recover cost, leading to brand reputation problems down the road.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To avoid situations like that, reach an understanding with the factory ahead of time on how to handle scrap units or exceptional yield loss. This may include, for example, a dedicated “scrap” line item inside the quotation to handle defectiveness explicitly.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev1sec67">ORDER MORE UNITS THAN THE PROVEN DEMAND</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Despite everyone’s best efforts, mistakes will happen, customers will receive bad devices, and you’ll want extra working units for returns and exchanges. Ordering 1,000 pieces to fulfill a 1,000-piece Kickstarter campaign means if customers want to return or exchange units that were broken in shipping, all you can do is issue refunds. It’s just not practical to fire up the factory to make a dozen replacement units.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As a general rule, I order a few percent excess beyond the number of units I need to deliver to customers, to have stock on hand to handle returns and exchanges. Units that don’t get used up by the returns process can be turned into demo loaners or business development giveaways to drum up the next set of orders!</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev1sec68">SHIPPING COSTS MONEY</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Keep an eye on shipping costs. These fees aren’t typically built into a factory’s quotation, but they impact your bottom line, even more so for low-volume products. Shipping FedEx is a great way to save time, but it’s also very expensive. Courier fees can easily wash out the profit on a small project, so manage those costs.</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong>NOTE</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>Couriers offer discounts to frequent shippers, but you have to call in to negotiate the special rates.</em></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev1sec69"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_113"/>FACTOR IN IMPORT DUTIES</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Components imported to China without an import license are levied a roughly 20 percent compulsory duty on their value. The general rule for China is dutiable on import, duty free on export. If something is accidentally shipped across the border to Hong Kong, expect to pay a duty to get it back into China, too.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Get a customs broker to work angles for saving money; for example, some brokers can get goods taxed by their weight and not their value, which for microelectronics is typically a good deal. I haven’t figured out all the customs rules, as they seem to be a moving target. Every month it seems there’s a new rule, fine, exceptional fee, or tariff to deal with. There are also plenty of shady ways to get goods into China, but I sleep better at night knowing I do my best to comply with every rule.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Quotations don’t include duties, because factories assume by default that you will have an import license. Import licenses enable the duty-free import of goods. But import licenses cost a few thousand bucks, take weeks to process, and have no room for flexibility, as they are tied to an exact BOM for the product. Small engineering change orders can invalidate an import license. I’ve known customs officers to count the number of decoupling caps on a PCB, and if it doesn’t match the count in the license, a fine is levied and the license is invalidated. Even deviations in the material used to line a decorative box can invalidate a license. In short, this import license scheme favors high-volume products, and punishes low-volume producers, so tread lightly.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec70"><strong>CLOSING THOUGHTS</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindenta">Going to China for manufacturing clearly isn’t for everyone. Particularly if you’re based in the United States, the overhead of courier fees, travel, duties, and late-night conference calls adds up rapidly. As a rule of thumb, a small US-based company <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_114"/>is often better off assembling PCBs in the United States for volumes under 1,000 units, and you won’t start seeing clear advantages until volumes of perhaps 5,000 to 10,000 units.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">That math shifts in China’s favor as processes like injection molding and chassis assembly come into play, due to the expertise Chinese factories have in these labor-intensive processes. The break-even point can also be much lower if you live in or near China, as courier fees, travel, and time-zone impact are all a small fraction of what they’d be from the United States. This compounds with the fact that locals are more effective at leveraging the component ecosystem in China, leading to further cost reductions compared to a design produced using only US parts.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">On the other hand, physically large assemblies or systems built using lots of dutiable components may be cheaper to build domestically, as they save on shipping costs and tariffs. In the end, keep an open mind and try to consider all the possible secondary costs and benefits of domestic versus foreign manufacturing before deciding where to park production.</p>&#13;

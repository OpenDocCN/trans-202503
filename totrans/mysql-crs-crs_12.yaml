- en: In Part III, you’ll create database objects like views, functions, procedures,
    triggers, and events. These objects will be stored on your MySQL server so you
    can call them whenever you need them.

    the results of a query as a table-like structure.

    take an action you define when rows are inserted, updated, or deleted from a table.

- en: '| `tr_beer_ad` | A trigger that automatically takes an action after some rows
    in the beer table are deleted. I use the tr_ prefix for triggers so that they
    won’t be confused with tables, which also start with the letter t. The suffix
    _ad stands for after delete. _bd stands for before delete. _bu and _au stand for
    before and after update, respectively. _bi and _ai stand for before and after
    insert, respectively. You’ll learn what those suffixes mean in Chapter 12. |'

- en: In previous chapters, you’ve named tables descriptively so that other programmers
    can quickly understand the nature of the data that the table is storing. For database
    objects other than tables, you’ll continue using that approach and also prefix
    the name of the object with a short description of its type (as in `v_` for *view*);
    occasionally, you’ll add a suffix as well (as in `_ad` for *after delete*).

    you quickly understand a database object’s purpose.

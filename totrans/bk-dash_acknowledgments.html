<p class="TNI">Putting together a programming book like this is a group effort that builds on the ideas and contributions of many people.</p>
<p class="TX">First and foremost, we want to thank <i>you</i>, the reader, for spending your valuable time with us. Our main goal is to make reading this book worth your while and, hopefully, get you as excited as we are about creating your own dashboard applications.</p>
<p class="TX">We would also like to thank the Plotly Dash community members for making the Plotly forum a thriving place. Over the years, we’ve learned a lot from the forum and honed our Dash skills thanks to the curiosity and constant support of the community.</p>
<p class="TX">Our deep gratitude goes to the wonderful team at No Starch Press for making the book writing process such a delightful experience. Special thanks to our outstanding editor, Liz Chadwick, for being there for us throughout the project. Liz truly is a one-of-a-kind editor, and we’re very lucky to have had her support! Jennifer Kepler, our production editor, pushed this book from rough draft to final publication, which was not an easy endeavor—thanks a million, Jennifer! Our technical reviewer, Tom Begley, helped us significantly improve this book by contributing his impressive technical programming and Dash expertise. Moreover, we’re thankful to Bill Pollock, founder of No Starch Press, for believing in our project and allowing us to contribute to his inspiring mission to educate more coders.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page xvi. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xvi" role="doc-pagebreak"></span>Lastly, we’re very grateful to our beloved partners for enduring the long night and weekend shifts to work on this project.</p>
<p class="TX">And with that, let’s get started!</p>

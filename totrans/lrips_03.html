“Steganosauruses don’t exist, huh?”</p><p>“That lady doesn’t know what she’s talking about. Her place had some really
good bugs, though.”</p><p>“Maybe she’s right.”</p><p>“She says Steganosauruses don’t exist because she’s never seen one. But that
proves my point! Steganosauruses are so good at hiding that people think they’re
imaginary.”</p><p>“That doesn’t make any sense, Xor.”</p><p>“Who are you going to believe, me or your own eyes?” <span class="emphasis"><em>Squawk!</em></span>
Laurie felt something brush her shoulder. Before she knew it, a fat bird was flying away with Xor in
its talons.</p><p>“<span class="emphasis"><em>Hey!</em></span>” Laurie ran after the bird as it slowly flew to a
nearby branch. It was so fat it was almost spherical, about the size and shape of a coconut. There
were two more just like it in the tree.</p><p>Laurie jumped at the bird holding Xor, but it tossed the lizard to another bird, which caught
him in its beak. She jumped at that one, but then Xor was thrown to another.</p><p>The birds enjoyed playing keepaway. When their mouths weren’t full of lizard, they
hopped up and down and sang a silly rhyme:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>“Faster and faster—”<br/>
 “—too fast to follow—”<br/>
  “—Round Robins throw faster—”<br/>
   “—than an unladen swallow!”<br/>
</p></div><p>“Give him back!” Laurie shouted. “He’s my friend!” The Round
Robins only cackled and mocked her.</p><div class="literallayout"><p>“Give him back!”<br/>
 “Give him back!”<br/>
  “We think he will make—”<br/>
   “—an afternoon snack!”</p></div><p>“Help!” Xor squeaked in terror. “They want to eat me!”</p><div class="literallayout"><p>“Thought he was hiding—”<br/>
 “—but bird eyes can see—”<br/>
  “—an evenly dividing—”<br/>
   “—meal for three!”</p></div><p>“No!” Laurie picked up a stone and threw it at the nearest Round Robin. To her
utter surprise, it didn’t fly away. The fat, nasty thing <span class="emphasis"><em>caught the
stone</em></span>.</p><div class="literallayout"><p>“A stone!”<br/>
 “How rude!”<br/>
  “Hardly a treasure.”<br/>
   “We’ll happily juggle it—”<br/>
    “—for your pleasure!”</p></div><p>They played catch with the stone and Xor. Laurie threw another stone, and then another, but
the birds caught those, too. Now the Round Robins were juggling three stones plus Xor. This
wasn’t getting Laurie anywhere. She paused, thinking, another stone in her hand.</p><div class="literallayout"><p>“Gave up so soon?” <br/>
 “We love to play ball!” <br/>
  “Throw us more toys—”<br/>
   “—and we’ll catch them all!”</p></div><p>Instead of throwing the single stone, Laurie scooped up a large handful and started tossing
them in nice, easy lobs, one by one. The Robins caught each stone and juggled it. If they
hadn’t been trying to eat her friend, Laurie would have been impressed.</p><p>“What are you doing? Save me!” Xor said.</p><p>Soon, the three Robins were having trouble keeping so many things in the air. Laurie threw the
stones harder and faster, trying to knock the birds off balance. They sang for
reinforcements.</p><div class="literallayout"><p>“More wings, my brothers!”<br/>
 “More beaks and more talons!”<br/>
  “We need more Round Robins—” <br/>
   “—to evenly balance!”</p></div><p>Five more of the creatures flapped and flopped in to join the party of their murderous kin.
They evened out the load of stones and mocked Laurie even more loudly.</p><div class="literallayout"><p>“You can’t beat us that way!”<br/>
 “We’ll have our meal!”<br/>
  “Each one will eat less—” <br/>
   “—but a deal’s a deal!”</p></div><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00008a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00008"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="figs/web/024fig01.png.jpg"/></div></div><p>The birds were juggling 15, 20, 25 stones now. They could catch whatever Laurie threw at them,
and a dozen more of the creatures were waiting to join in. How could she get Xor away from
them?</p><div class="literallayout"><p>“Clever Round Robins,”<br/>
 “too many to beat!”<br/>
  “You can’t stop the Robins—”<br/>
   “—when there’s dinner to eat!”</p></div><p>It was hard to concentrate with the birds singing and Xor screaming, but Laurie waited again,
trying to see a pattern. A Round Robin can catch anything. . . .</p><div class="literallayout"><p>“’Round he goes!”<br/>
 “Where will he stop?”<br/>
  “Stones all a-juggle,”<br/>
   “but the lizard won’t—<span class="emphasis"><em>mmph!</em></span>”</p></div><p>Just as one of the birds was about to catch Xor, Laurie hit it in the beak with a nice big
clod of dirt. A Round Robin can catch anything. But it can’t catch <span class="emphasis"><em>two</em></span>
things!</p><p>She caught Xor as he fell and ran away as fast as she could. Stones and furious Robins flew
everywhere as the flock lost its rhythm. Some tried to chase her, but they were too fat to keep up
and too angry to rhyme.</p><div class="literallayout"><p>“No fair!”<br/>
 “No fair!”<br/>
  “You stole our snack!”<br/>
   “Come back!”<br/>
    “No fair!”<br/>
     “You stole . . .”</p></div><p>“Are you okay?” Laurie said.</p><p>“No . . . yes . . . maybe.” Xor was breathing hard. They both were. The little
lizard didn’t look hurt, but he was scared out of his wits. “Birds!”</p><p>“This is why you have to blend in, isn’t it?” she asked. “Birds want
to eat you.”</p><p>“I hate birds.”</p></div></body></html>

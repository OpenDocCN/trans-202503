<div class="imagec"><img alt="image" src="graphics/common01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">To perform useful tasks or give you useful information, some programs need input from you. For example, in Microsoft Word you enter text, click buttons to make it look good, and enter a filename to save it. In a web browser, you click links or enter a URL or search term to find a web page. In drawing programs, you draw by clicking and dragging the mouse. When you use a program and give it information that helps it do its job, that information is called <em>user input</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Programs need a way to ask users for input, process that input, and respond correctly. Programs that do this are <em>interactive</em>. In this chapter, you’ll make your programs interactive by giving them the capability to accept and react to user input, which will be in the form of strings and numbers.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec01"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_74"/><span class="blue"><strong>Talking to the Computer</strong></span></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Until now, all the information your programs needed was in the source code. For example, look at the program in <a href="ch06.html#ch6ex1">Listing 6-1</a>.</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">1 <span class="green"><span class="codeitalic">' CircleArea.sb</span></span><br/>2 radius <span class="brown">=</span> <span class="red">5</span><br/>3 area <span class="brown">=</span> <span class="red">3.1416</span> <span class="brown">*</span> radius <span class="brown">*</span> radius<br/>4 <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.WriteLine(</span><span class="red">"Area = "</span> <span class="brown">+</span> area<span class="brown">)</span></p>&#13;
<p class="listcap"><a id="ch6ex1"/><em>Listing 6-1: Finding the area of a circle</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This program uses a fixed value of 5 for the radius in line 2. This is called <em>hard-coded</em> data. Hard-coded data is part of the program. If you want to change that data, you must change the source code. For example, to find the area of a circle using a different radius, you’d open the file, change the radius value in your code, save the file, and run the new code. It’s a pain to do this every time you want to change the value of a variable. And if you give this code to someone who doesn’t know how to program, it won’t be very useful.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec01"><em><strong>Your Number, Please?</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Clearly, it’d be best if you could calculate the area of any circle without having to change the source code. So let’s explore how to read values directly input by users. We want our program to ask the user to enter a value for the radius and then use that value in the calculation. To do this, you’ll use the <span class="literal">TextWindow</span> method <span class="literal">ReadNumber()</span>. Replace line 2 in <a href="ch06.html#ch6ex1">Listing 6-1</a> with the following statement:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">radius <span class="brown">=</span> <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.ReadNumber()</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When this statement runs, a flashing cursor appears in the text window, as shown in <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig1">Figure 6-1</a>. The cursor is the program’s way of saying, “It’s your turn to type. I’m waiting. Don’t make me come over there!”</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="graphics/f06-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch6fig1"/><em>Figure 6-1: Running the</em> <span class="literal"><span class="codeitalic">ReadNumber()</span></span> <em>method</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When the user types a number and presses <small>ENTER</small>, the input is stored for the rest of the program to use. Whatever number the user entered is now stored in the <span class="literal">radius</span> variable.</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><span class="notes"><strong>NOTE</strong></span></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>Run the program and try to enter a character other than a number. What happens? The program won’t accept anything that’s not a number! That’s why the method is named</em> <span class="literal"><span class="codeitalic">ReadNumber()</span></span>.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec02"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_75"/><em><strong>Introducing Yourself to Your Computer</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A program can also accept user input in the form of text, or strings. Let’s imagine we want to greet the player with their name. We’ll store the player’s name in a variable called <span class="literal">userName</span> but use a new <span class="literal">TextWindow</span> method called <span class="literal">Read()</span>. Run the following program, and enter your name when you see the cursor:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">userName <span class="brown">=</span> <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.Read()</span><br/><span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.Write(</span><span class="red">"Hello "</span> <span class="brown">+</span> userName <span class="brown">+</span> <span class="red">". "</span><span class="brown">)</span><br/><span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.WriteLine(</span><span class="red">"It's really nice to meet you."</span><span class="brown">)</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The first statement accepts the text the user entered in the text window and stores that text in <span class="literal">userName</span>. The program then greets the user with their name.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">So what’s the difference between <span class="literal">Read()</span> and <span class="literal">ReadNumber()</span>? <span class="literal">Read()</span> works exactly like <span class="literal">ReadNumber()</span>: they both show a flashing cursor and wait for the user to type input and press <small>ENTER</small>. In fact, you can even use <span class="literal">Read()</span> to get numbers from a user. But <span class="literal">ReadNumber()</span> will accept <em>only</em> a number from a user, so we recommend you use it when you need your user to enter a number.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec03"><em><strong>Writing Prompts for Input</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A flashing cursor without instructions doesn’t tell your user what kind of data to input (like a number, a name, an address, or favorite type of monkey). Unless your program is written for a magician or a mind reader like Professor X, you should provide some instructions before you allow your program to accept input from <span class="literal">Read()</span> or <span class="literal">ReadNumber()</span>. To do this, you’ll display a <em>prompt</em>, which is a message that tells the user what kind of data to enter.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">From <a href="ch06.html#ch6ex1">Listing 6-1</a>, replace line 2 with these two lines:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.Write(</span><span class="red">"Please enter a radius; then press &lt;Enter&gt;: "</span><span class="brown">)</span><br/>radius <span class="brown">=</span> <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.ReadNumber()</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">First, we call the <span class="literal">Write()</span> method and pass it a message to display. In this program, the message you pass is a prompt telling your user to enter a value for the radius and then press <small>ENTER</small>. You end the prompt with a colon to show the user that the program’s waiting for keyboard input. (You don’t need the colon, but it’s clearer to your user.) Use <span class="literal">Write()</span> instead of <span class="literal">WriteLine()</span> to keep the cursor on the same line as the prompt. After you call <span class="literal">Write()</span>, you call <span class="literal">ReadNumber()</span> to accept the number input by the user and store it in the variable <span class="literal">radius</span>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">After adding these two statements, run your program to see something like <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig2">Figure 6-2</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_76"/><img alt="image" src="graphics/f06-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch6fig2"/><em>Figure 6-2: The text window waiting for input from your user</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When Small Basic runs the statement <span class="literal">radius = TextWindow.ReadNumber()</span>, it waits for the user to enter a number and press <small>ENTER</small>. The program won’t read what the user types until they press <small>ENTER</small>. When the user presses <small>ENTER</small>, the program grabs the user input and assigns it to the <span class="literal">radius</span> variable. The program then continues with the statement after the <span class="literal">ReadNumber()</span> method.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now that you’ve accepted the radius from your user, all that’s left is to compute the area and display the result. <a href="ch06.html#ch6ex2">Listing 6-2</a> shows the complete program.</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">1 <span class="green"><span class="codeitalic">' CircleArea3.sb</span></span><br/>2 <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.Write(</span><span class="red">"Please enter a radius; then press &lt;Enter&gt;: "</span><span class="brown">)</span><br/>3 radius <span class="brown">=</span> <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.ReadNumber()</span><br/>4<br/>5 area <span class="brown">=</span> <span class="red">3.1416</span> <span class="brown">*</span> radius <span class="brown">*</span> radius<br/>6 <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.WriteLine(</span><span class="red">"Area = "</span> <span class="brown">+</span> area<span class="brown">)</span></p>&#13;
<p class="listcap"><a id="ch6ex2"/><em>Listing 6-2: Letting the user enter the radius</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Let’s see what the output looks like if you enter a radius of 8:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">Please enter a radius; then press &lt;Enter&gt;: <span class="codestrong">8</span><br/>Area = 201.0624</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Try it out for yourself!</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec04"><em><strong>A Moment of Silence, Please (Pause)</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">At times you may need to display some instructions to your user (like explaining the rules of Hide and Go Tickle) and then wait for them to read those instructions. For example, you might display the instructions followed by “Press any key to continue ...” and then wait for the user to press a key to show that they’re ready to continue. You can do this by using the <span class="literal">Pause()</span> method.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To see this method in action, let’s write a program that converts the computer into a wisdom machine. Each time the user presses a key, the computer displays a new bit of wisdom. The program is shown in <a href="ch06.html#ch6ex3">Listing 6-3</a>.</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"> 1 <span class="green"><span class="codeitalic">' WisdomMachine.sb</span></span><br/> 2 <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.WriteLine(</span><span class="red">"WISDOM OF THE DAY"</span><span class="brown">)</span><br/> 3<br/> 4 <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.WriteLine(</span><span class="red">"A friend in need is a friend indeed."</span><span class="brown">)</span><br/> 5 <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.Pause()</span><br/> 6<br/> 7 <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.WriteLine(</span><span class="red">"A hungry man is an angry man."</span><span class="brown">)</span><br/> 8 <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.Pause()</span><br/> 9<br/>10 <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.WriteLine(</span><span class="red">"Love your enemies.

<p class="listcap"><a id="ch6ex3"/><em>Listing 6-3: Demonstrating the</em> <span class="literal"><span class="codeitalic">Pause()</span></span> <em>method</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_77"/>After showing the first wise saying (line 4), the program calls <span class="literal">Pause()</span> to give the user time to read it (line 5). This call displays “Press any key to continue ...” and waits for the user to press a key. When the user presses a key, the program displays the next bit of wisdom (line 7) and pauses again (line 8). The program continues to do this until the last statement is executed. Add more wise sayings to this program, and then share it with someone!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">What if you want to display a statement other than “Press any key to continue ...,” such as “Press any key to see the next line of wisdom ...”? Well, Small Basic provides you with the <span class="literal">PauseWithoutMessage()</span> method for this purpose. You can write a custom prompt using <span class="literal">Write()</span> or <span class="literal">WriteLine()</span> as usual, and then call <span class="literal">PauseWithoutMessage()</span> to wait for the user. Try it out. Replace the calls to <span class="literal">Pause()</span> in lines 5 and 8 of <a href="ch06.html#ch6ex3">Listing 6-3</a> with these statements:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.WriteLine(</span><span class="red">"Press any key to see the next line of wisdom..."</span><span class="brown">)</span><br/><span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.PauseWithoutMessage()</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Your program runs the same way as before but uses a more descriptive prompt.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec02"><span class="blue"><strong>Working with User Input</strong></span></h3>&#13;

In lines 6–7, the third number (15) and fourth number (25) are added and saved to <span class="literal">sum</span> (totaling 70).

<p class="indent">Because of how the <span class="literal">sum</span> variable keeps adding input to itself (or accumulating), it’s known as an <em>accumulator</em> (also known as a <em>running sum</em>).

<p class="noindent">Write an interactive Mad Libs–style program in which you ask the user to enter the name of their favorite princess (such as Snow White), something evil, the name of a school for princesses, something yummy, a name for a short wizard, something so valuable that they’d never sell it, a verb, small creatures, and a superhero’s power.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Then display the following story for the user, and replace the bracketed terms with the user’s input:</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Princess [PrincessName] was traveling through the forest when suddenly the evil [SomethingEvil] jumped out at her and offered her an apple. Princess [PrincessName] refused, because her mother sent her to [NameOfSchool], where she learned that you don’t take unwrapped food from strangers (it could be poisoned). So Princess [PrincessName] continued through the woods until she came upon a house made of [SomethingYummy]! Not wanting to damage private property, she kept walking. Next, Princess [PrincessName] came upon a spinning wheel where a short man named [ShortWizard’sName] tempted her to use a magic spinning wheel to make gold (in exchange for her [SomethingValuable]). But Princess [PrincessName]’s mother had already told her that an evil fairy had cast a spell on her when she was a baby and that she’d [Verb] forever if she pricked her finger on a spinning wheel. So Princess [PrincessName] kept walking and arrived safely home to a cottage with seven [SmallCreatures], where she locked herself in her room for the rest of her life because she had the power of [SuperHeroPower].”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Then make your own interactive story program with a new character (like a hero, ninja, pirate, or My Little Pony), and share it!</p>&#13;

<li><p class="noindenta">Using Small Basic, you can easily turn your computer into a number wizard! Open the file <em>Magician.sb</em> from this chapter’s folder and run it. Explain how the program works.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindenta">Make a silly Mad Libs–style game using the phrase, “One man’s trash is another man’s treasure.” Another version of the phrase is, “One man’s loss is another man’s gain.” For your version, ask the user for two living creatures and two different nouns. Then have your program output in this format: “One [Creature1]’s [Noun1] is another [Creature2]’s [Noun2].”</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindenta">Eve’s mom is having a garage sale. Because Eve wants to earn some money, she sets up a table to sell lemonade, cookies, and her homemade greeting cards as the customers come up the driveway (she’s a genius salesperson, so she sells a lot). Help Eve count the money her customers give her by creating a program that asks Eve to enter the number of dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies she earned. Then have it convert them into a total dollar amount, and display that amount in dollars and cents (like $23.34). Try your program using the following amounts to make sure it works:</p>&#13;
<p class="olista">a. 35 dollars, 3 quarters, 3 pennies</p>&#13;
<p class="olista">b. 2 dollars, 1 quarter, 2 pennies</p>&#13;
<p class="olista">c. 10 dollars, 1 nickel, 3 pennies</p>&#13;
<p class="olista">d. 6 dollars, 1 quarter, 3 pennies</p>&#13;
<p class="olista">e. 3 dollars, 2 quarters, 1 dime, 1 nickel, 3 pennies</p>&#13;
<p class="olista">f. 1 dollar, 2 dimes, 1 nickel, 4 pennies<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_82"/></p></li>&#13;

<p class="ChapterIntro">In <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 2">Chapter 2</span>, I introduced the concept of a <em>relational database</em>, an application that supports data stored across multiple, related tables. In a relational model, each table typically holds data on a single entity—such as students, cars, purchases, houses—and each row in the table describes one of those entities. A process known as a <em>table join</em> allows us to link rows in one table to rows in other tables.</p>&#13;
<p>The concept of relational databases came from the British computer scientist Edgar F. Codd. While working for IBM in 1970, he published a paper called “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks.” His ideas revolutionized database design and led to the development of SQL. With the relational model, you can build tables that eliminate duplicate data, are easier to maintain, and provide for increased flexibility in writing queries to get just the data you want.</p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-501065c07-0001"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="94" id="Page_94"/>Linking Tables Using JOIN</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">To connect tables in a query, we use a <code>JOIN ... ON</code> construct (or one of the other <code>JOIN</code> variants I’ll cover in this chapter). A <code>JOIN</code>, which is part of the ANSI SQL standard, links one table to another in the database using a <em>Boolean</em> value expression in the <code>ON</code> clause. A commonly used syntax tests for equality and commonly takes this form:</p>&#13;
<pre><code>SELECT * &#13;
FROM<var> table_a</var> JOIN <var>table_b</var>&#13;
ON <var>table_a.key_column</var> = <var>table_b.foreign_key_column</var></code></pre>&#13;
<p>This is similar to the basic <code>SELECT</code> you’ve already learned, but instead of naming one table in the <code>FROM</code> clause, we name a table, give the <code>JOIN</code> keyword, and then name a second table. The <code>ON</code> clause follows, where we place an expression using the equals comparison operator. When the query runs, it returns rows from both tables where the expression in the <code>ON</code> clause evaluates to <code>true</code>, meaning values in the specified columns are equal.</p>&#13;
<p>You can use any expression that evaluates to the <em>Boolean</em> results <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. For example, you could match where values from one column are greater than or equal to values in the other:</p>&#13;
<pre><code>ON <var>table_a.key_column</var> &gt;= <var>table_b.foreign_key_column</var></code></pre>&#13;
<p>That’s rare, but it’s an option if your analysis requires it.</p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-501065c07-0002">Relating Tables with Key Columns</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Consider this example of relating tables with key columns: imagine you’re a data analyst with the task of checking on a public agency’s payroll spending by department. You file a Freedom of Information Act request for that agency’s salary data, expecting to receive a simple spreadsheet listing each employee and their salary, arranged like this:</p>&#13;
<pre><code>dept    location    first_name    last_name    salary&#13;
----    --------    ----------    ---------    ------&#13;
IT      Boston      Julia         Reyes        115300&#13;
IT      Boston      Janet         King          98000&#13;
Tax     Atlanta     Arthur        Pappas        72700&#13;
Tax     Atlanta     Michael       Taylor        89500</code></pre>&#13;
<p>But that’s not what arrives. Instead, the agency sends you a data dump from its payroll system: a dozen CSV files, each representing one table in its database. You read the document explaining the data layout (be sure to always ask for it!) and start to make sense of the columns in each table. Two tables stand out: one named <code>employees</code> and another named <code>departments</code>.</p>&#13;
<p>Using the code in <a href="#listing7-1" id="listinganchor7-1">Listing 7-1</a>, let’s create versions of these tables, insert rows, and examine how to join the data in both tables. Using the <code>analysis</code> database you’ve created for these exercises, run all the code, and then look <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="95" id="Page_95"/>at the data either by using a basic <code>SELECT</code> statement or by clicking the table name in pgAdmin and selecting <b>View/Edit Data</b><span class="MenuArrow">▶</span><b>All Rows</b>.</p>&#13;
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE departments (&#13;
    dept_id integer,&#13;
    dept text,&#13;
    city text,&#13;
  <span class="CodeAnnotationHang" aria-label="annotation1">1</span> CONSTRAINT dept_key PRIMARY KEY (dept_id),&#13;
  <span class="CodeAnnotationHang" aria-label="annotation2">2</span> CONSTRAINT dept_city_unique UNIQUE (dept, city)&#13;
);&#13;
&#13;
CREATE TABLE employees (&#13;

    (3, 'Arthur', 'Pappas', 72700, 2),&#13;
    (4, 'Michael', 'Taylor', 89500, 2);</code></pre>&#13;
<p class="CodeListingCaption"><a id="listing7-1">Listing 7-1</a>: Creating the <code>departments</code> and <code>employees</code> tables</p>&#13;
<p>The two tables follow Codd’s relational model in that each describes attributes about a single entity: the agency’s departments and employees. In the <code>departments</code> table, you should see the following contents:</p>&#13;
<pre><code>dept_id    dept    city&#13;
-------    ----    -------&#13;
      1    Tax     Atlanta&#13;
      2    IT      Boston</code></pre>&#13;
<p>The <code>dept_id</code> column is the table’s primary key. A <em>primary key</em> is a column or collection of columns whose values uniquely identify each row in a table. A valid primary key column enforces certain constraints:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>The column or collection of columns must have a unique value for each row.</li>&#13;
<li>The column or collection of columns can’t have missing values.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p>You define the primary key for <code>departments</code> <span class="CodeAnnotation" aria-label="annotation1">1</span> and <code>employees</code> <span class="CodeAnnotation" aria-label="annotation4">4</span> using a <code>CONSTRAINT</code> keyword, which I’ll cover in depth with additional constraint <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="96" id="Page_96"/>types in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 8">Chapter 8</span>. The values in <code>dept_id</code> uniquely identify each row in <code>departments</code>, and although this example contains only a department name and city, this table would likely include additional information, such as an address or contact information.</p>&#13;
<p>The <code>employees</code> table should have the following contents:</p>&#13;
<pre><code>emp_id first_name last_name  salary   dept_id&#13;
------ ---------- --------- --------- -------&#13;
     1 Julia      Reyes     115300.00       1&#13;
     2 Janet      King       98000.00       1&#13;
     3 Arthur     Pappas     72700.00       2&#13;
     4 Michael    Taylor     89500.00       2</code></pre>&#13;
<p>The values in <code>emp_id</code> uniquely identify each row in the <code>employees</code> table. To identify which department each employee works in, the table includes a <code>dept_id</code> column. The values in this column refer to values in the <code>departments</code> table’s primary key. We call this a <em>foreign key</em>, which you add as a constraint <span class="CodeAnnotation" aria-label="annotation3">3</span> when creating the table. A foreign key constraint requires that its values already exist in the columns it references. Often, that’s another table’s primary key, but it can reference any columns that have unique values for each row. So, values in <code>dept_id</code> in the <code>employees</code> table must exist in <code>dept_id</code> in the <code>departments</code> table; otherwise, you can’t add them. This helps enforce the integrity of the data. Unlike a primary key, a foreign key column can be empty, and it can contain duplicate values.</p>&#13;
<p>In this example, the <code>dept_id</code> associated with the employee <code>Julia Reyes</code> is <code>1</code>; this refers to the value of <code>1</code> in the <code>departments</code> table’s primary key, <code>dept_id</code>. That tells us that <code>Julia Reyes</code> is part of the <code>Tax</code> department located in <code>Atlanta</code>.</p>&#13;
<aside epub:type="sidebar">&#13;
<div class="top hr"><hr/></div>&#13;
<section class="note">&#13;
<h2><span class="NoteHead">Note</span></h2>&#13;
<p>	Primary key values need to be unique only within a table. That’s why it’s okay for both the <code>employees</code> table and the <code>departments</code> table to have primary key values using the same numbers.</p>&#13;
<div class="bottom hr"><hr/></div>&#13;
</section>&#13;
</aside>&#13;
<p>The <code>departments</code> table also includes a <code>UNIQUE</code> constraint, which I’ll discuss in more depth in “The UNIQUE Constraint” in the next chapter. Briefly, it guarantees that values in a column, or a combination of values in more than one column, are unique. Here, it requires that each row have a unique pair of values for <code>dept</code> and <code>city</code> <span class="CodeAnnotation" aria-label="annotation2">2</span>, which helps avoid duplicate data—the table won’t have two departments in Atlanta named <code>Tax</code>, for example. Often, you can use such unique combinations to create a <em>natural key</em> for a primary key, which we’ll also discuss in the next chapter.</p>&#13;
<p>You might ask: what’s the advantage of breaking data into components like this? Well, consider what this sample of data would look like if you had received it the way you initially thought you would, all in one table:</p>&#13;
<pre><code>dept    location    first_name    last_name    salary&#13;
----    --------    ----------    ---------    ------&#13;
IT      Boston      Julia         Reyes        115300&#13;
IT      Boston      Janet         King          98000&#13;
Tax     Atlanta     Arthur        Pappas        72700&#13;
Tax     Atlanta     Michael       Taylor        89500</code></pre>&#13;
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="97" id="Page_97"/>First, when you combine data from various entities in one table, inevitably you have to repeat information. This happens here: the department name and location are spelled out for each employee. This may be acceptable when the table consists of four rows like this, or even 4,000. But when a table holds millions of rows, repeating lengthy strings is redundant and wastes precious space.</p>&#13;
<p>Second, cramming all that data into one table makes managing the data difficult. What if the Marketing department changes its name to Brand Marketing? Each row in the table would require an update, which can introduce errors if someone mistakenly updates some but not all the rows. In this model, an update to a department name is much simpler—just change one row in a table.</p>&#13;
<p>Finally, the fact that information is organized, or <em>normalized</em>, across several tables doesn’t prevent us from viewing it as a whole. We can always query the data using <code>JOIN</code> to bring columns from tables together.</p>&#13;
<p>Now that you know the basics of how tables can relate, let’s look at how to join them in a query.</p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-501065c07-0003">Querying Multiple Tables Using JOIN</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">When you join tables in a query, the database connects rows in both tables where the columns you specified for the join have values that result in the <code>ON</code> clause expression returning <code>true</code>. The query results then include columns from both tables if you requested them as part of the query. You also can use columns from the joined tables to filter results using a <code>WHERE</code> clause.</p>&#13;
<p>Queries that join tables are similar in syntax to basic <code>SELECT</code> statements. The difference is that the query also specifies the following:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>The tables and columns to join, using a SQL <code>JOIN ... ON</code> construct</li>&#13;
<li>The type of join to perform using variations of the <code>JOIN</code> keyword</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p>Let’s look at the <code>JOIN ... ON</code> construct syntax first and then explore various types of joins. To join the example <code>employees</code> and <code>departments</code> tables and see all the related data from both, start by writing a query like the one in <a href="#listing7-2" id="listinganchor7-2">Listing 7-2</a>.</p>&#13;
<pre><code><span class="CodeAnnotationHang" aria-label="annotation1">1</span> SELECT *&#13;
<span class="CodeAnnotationHang" aria-label="annotation2">2</span> FROM employees JOIN departments&#13;
<span class="CodeAnnotationHang" aria-label="annotation3">3</span> ON employees.dept_id = departments.dept_id&#13;
ORDER BY employees.dept_id;</code></pre>&#13;
<p class="CodeListingCaption"><a id="listing7-2">Listing 7-2</a>: Joining the <code>employees</code> and <code>departments</code> tables</p>&#13;
<p>In the example, you include an asterisk wildcard with the <code>SELECT</code> statement to include all columns from all tables used in the query <span class="CodeAnnotation" aria-label="annotation1">1</span>. Next, in the <code>FROM</code> clause, you place the <code>JOIN</code> keyword <span class="CodeAnnotation" aria-label="annotation2">2</span> between the two tables you want to link. Finally, you specify the expression to evaluate using the <code>ON</code> clause <span class="CodeAnnotation" aria-label="annotation3">3</span>. For each table, you provide the table name, a period, and the column that contains the key values. An equal sign goes between the two table and column names.</p>&#13;
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="98" id="Page_98"/>When you run the query, the results include all values from both tables where values in the <code>dept_id</code> columns match. In fact, even the <code>dept_id</code> column appears twice because you selected all columns of both tables:</p>&#13;
<pre><code>emp_id   first_name   last_name   salary      dept_id   dept_id   dept   city&#13;
------   ----------   ---------   ---------   -------   -------   ----   -------&#13;
     1   Julia        Reyes       115300.00         1         1   Tax    Atlanta&#13;
     2   Janet        King         98000.00         1         1   Tax    Atlanta&#13;
     3   Arthur       Pappas       72700.00         2         2   IT     Boston&#13;
     4   Michael      Taylor       89500.00         2         2   IT     Boston</code></pre>&#13;
<p>So, even though the data lives in two tables, each with a focused set of columns, you can query those tables to pull the relevant data back together. In “Selecting Specific Columns in a Join” later in this chapter, I’ll show you how to retrieve only the columns you want from both tables.</p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-501065c07-0004">Understanding JOIN Types</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">There’s more than one way to join tables in SQL, and the type of join you’ll use depends on how you want to retrieve data. The following list describes the different types of joins. While reviewing each, it’s helpful to think of two tables side by side, one on the left of the <code>JOIN</code> keyword and the other on the right. A data-driven example of each join follows the list:</p>&#13;
<ol class="none">&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead"><span class="LiteralBold"><code>JOIN</code></span></span>  Returns rows from both tables where matching values are found in the joined columns of both tables. Alternate syntax is <code>INNER JOIN</code>.</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead"><span class="LiteralBold"><code>LEFT JOIN</code></span></span>  Returns every row from the left table. When SQL finds a row with a matching value in the right table, values from that row are included in the results. Otherwise, no values from the right table are displayed.</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead"><span class="LiteralBold"><code>RIGHT JOIN</code></span></span>  Returns every row from the right table. When SQL finds a row with a matching value in the left table, values from that row are included in the results. Otherwise, no values from the left table are displayed.</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead"><span class="LiteralBold"><code>FULL OUTER JOIN</code></span></span>  Returns every row from both tables and joins the rows where values in the joined columns match. If there’s no match for a value in either the left or right table, the query result contains no values for that table.</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead"><span class="LiteralBold"><code>CROSS JOIN</code></span></span>  Returns every possible combination of rows from both tables.</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<p>Let’s use data to see these joins in action. Say you have two simple tables that hold names of schools for a district that is planning future enrollments: <code>district_2020</code> and <code>district_2035</code>. There are four rows in <code>district_2020</code>:</p>&#13;
<pre><code>id          school_2020&#13;
--    ------------------------&#13;
 1    Oak Street School&#13;
 2    Roosevelt High School&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" title="99" id="Page_99"/> 5    Dover Middle School&#13;
 6    Webutuck High School</code></pre>&#13;
<p>There are five rows in <code>district_2035</code>:</p>&#13;
<pre><code>id         school_2035&#13;
--    ---------------------&#13;
 1    Oak Street School&#13;
 2    Roosevelt High School&#13;
 3    Morrison Elementary&#13;
 4    Chase Magnet Academy&#13;
 6    Webutuck High School</code></pre>&#13;
<p>Notice that the district expects changes over time. Only schools with an <code>id</code> of <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>6</code> exist in both tables, while others appear in just one of them. This scenario is common, and a common first task for a data analyst—especially if you have tables with many more rows than these—is to use SQL to identify which schools are present in both tables. Using different joins can help you find those schools, plus other details.</p>&#13;
<p>Again, using your <code>analysis</code> database, run the code in <a href="#listing7-3" id="listinganchor7-3">Listing 7-3</a> to build and populate these two tables.</p>&#13;
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE district_2020 (&#13;
  <span class="CodeAnnotationCode" aria-label="annotation1">1</span> id integer CONSTRAINT id_key_2020 PRIMARY KEY,&#13;
    school_2020 text&#13;
);&#13;
&#13;
CREATE TABLE district_2035 (&#13;
  <span class="CodeAnnotationCode" aria-label="annotation2">2</span> id integer CONSTRAINT id_key_2035 PRIMARY KEY,&#13;
    school_2035 text&#13;
);&#13;
&#13;
<span class="CodeAnnotationHang" aria-label="annotation3">3</span> INSERT INTO district_2020 VALUES&#13;
    (1, 'Oak Street School'),&#13;
    (2, 'Roosevelt High School'),&#13;
    (5, 'Dover Middle School'),&#13;
    (6, 'Webutuck High School');&#13;
&#13;
INSERT INTO district_2035 VALUES&#13;
    (1, 'Oak Street School'),&#13;
    (2, 'Roosevelt High School'),&#13;
    (3, 'Morrison Elementary'),&#13;
    (4, 'Chase Magnet Academy'),&#13;
    (6, 'Webutuck High School');</code></pre>&#13;
<p class="CodeListingCaption"><a id="listing7-3">Listing 7-3</a>: Creating two tables to explore <code>JOIN</code> types</p>&#13;
<p>We create and fill two tables: the declarations for these should by now look familiar, but there’s one new element: we add a primary key to each table. After the declaration for the <code>district_2020</code> <code>id</code> column <span class="CodeAnnotation" aria-label="annotation1">1</span> and the <code>district_2035</code> <code>id</code> column <span class="CodeAnnotation" aria-label="annotation2">2</span>, the keywords <code>CONSTRAINT </code><var>key_name</var><code> PRIMARY KEY</code> indicate that those columns will serve as the primary key for their table. That means for each row in both tables, the <code>id</code> column must be filled and <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="100" id="Page_100"/>contain a value that is unique for each row in that table. Finally, we use the familiar <code>INSERT</code> statements <span class="CodeAnnotation" aria-label="annotation3">3</span> to add the data to the tables.</p>&#13;
<h3 id="h2-501065c07-0001">JOIN</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">We use <code>JOIN</code>, or <code>INNER</code> <code>JOIN</code>, when we want to return only rows from both tables where values match in the columns we used for the join. To see an example of this, run the code in <a href="#listing7-4" id="listinganchor7-4">Listing 7-4</a>, which joins the two tables you just made.</p>&#13;
<pre><code>SELECT *&#13;
FROM district_2020 JOIN district_2035&#13;
ON district_2020.id = district_2035.id&#13;
ORDER BY district_2020.id;</code></pre>&#13;
<p class="CodeListingCaption"><a id="listing7-4">Listing 7-4</a>: Using <code>JOIN</code></p>&#13;
<p>Similar to the method we used in <a href="#listing7-2">Listing 7-2</a>, we name the two tables to join on both sides of the <code>JOIN</code> keyword. Then, in the <code>ON</code> clause, we specify the expression we’re using for the join, in this case equality in the <code>id</code> columns of both tables. Three school IDs exist in both tables, so the query returns only the three rows where those IDs match. Schools that exist in only one of the two tables don’t appear in the result. Notice also that the columns from the table on the left side of the <code>JOIN</code> keyword display on the left of the result table:</p>&#13;
<pre><code>id      school_2020      id      school_2035&#13;
-- --------------------- -- ---------------------&#13;
 1 Oak Street School      1 Oak Street School&#13;
 2 Roosevelt High School  2 Roosevelt High School&#13;
 6 Webutuck High School   6 Webutuck High School</code></pre>&#13;
<p>When should you use <code>JOIN</code>? Typically, when you’re working with well-structured, well-maintained datasets and need to find rows that exist in all the tables you’re joining. Because <code>JOIN</code> doesn’t provide rows that exist in only one of the tables, if you want to see all the data in one or more of the tables, use one of the other join types.</p>&#13;
<h4 id="h3-501065c07-0001">JOIN with USING </h4>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">If you’re using identical names for columns in a join’s <code>ON</code> clause, you can reduce redundant output and simplify the query syntax by substituting a <code>USING</code> clause in place of the <code>ON</code> clause, as in <a href="#listing7-5" id="listinganchor7-5">Listing 7-5</a>.</p>&#13;
<pre><code>SELECT *&#13;
FROM district_2020 JOIN district_2035&#13;
<span class="CodeAnnotationHang" aria-label="annotation1">1</span> USING (id)&#13;
ORDER BY district_2020.id;</code></pre>&#13;
<p class="CodeListingCaption"><a id="listing7-5">Listing 7-5</a>: <code>JOIN</code> with <code>USING</code></p>&#13;
<p>After naming the tables to join, we add <code>USING</code> <span class="CodeAnnotation" aria-label="annotation1">1</span> followed by, in parentheses, the name of the column for the join in both tables—in this case, <code>id</code>. <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="101" id="Page_101"/>If we’re joining on more than one column, we separate them by commas in the parentheses. Run the query, and you should see these results:</p>&#13;
<pre><code>id      school_2020           school_2035&#13;
-- --------------------- ---------------------&#13;
 1 Oak Street School     Oak Street School&#13;
 2 Roosevelt High School Roosevelt High School&#13;
 6 Webutuck High School  Webutuck High School</code></pre>&#13;
<p>Note that <code>id</code>, which in the case of this <code>JOIN</code> is present in both tables and has identical values, is displayed just once. It’s a simple, handy shorthand.</p>&#13;
<h3 id="h2-501065c07-0002">LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">In contrast to <code>JOIN</code>, the <code>LEFT JOIN</code> and <code>RIGHT JOIN</code> keywords each return all rows from one table and, when a row with a matching value in the other table exists, values from that row are included in the results. Otherwise, no values from the other table are displayed.</p>&#13;
<p>Let’s look at <code>LEFT JOIN</code> in action first. Execute the code in <a href="#listing7-6" id="listinganchor7-6">Listing 7-6</a>.</p>&#13;

Because <code>district_2035</code> doesn’t contain a value of <code>5</code> in its <code>id</code> column, there’s no match, so <code>LEFT</code> <code>JOIN</code> returns an empty row on the right rather than omitting the entire row from the left table as with <code>JOIN</code>. Finally, the rows from <code>district_2035</code> that don’t match any values in <code>district_2020</code> are omitted from the results:</p>&#13;

<li>You want your query results to contain all the rows from one of the tables.</li>&#13;
<li>You want to look for missing values in one of the tables. An example is when you’re comparing data about an entity representing two different time periods.</li>&#13;
<li>When you know some rows in a joined table won’t have matching values.</li>&#13;

<h3 id="h2-501065c07-0003">FULL OUTER JOIN</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">When you want to see all rows from both tables in a join, regardless of whether any match, use the <code>FULL OUTER JOIN</code> option. To see it in action, run <a href="#listing7-8" id="listinganchor7-8">Listing 7-8</a>.</p>&#13;

<p>Unless you want to take an extra-long coffee break, I suggest avoiding a <code>CROSS JOIN</code> query on large tables. Two tables with 250,000 records each would produce a result set of 62.5 <em>billion</em> rows and tax even the hardiest server. A more practical use would be generating data to create a checklist, such as all colors you’d want to offer for each of a handful of shirt styles in a store.</p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-501065c07-0005"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="104" id="Page_104"/>Using NULL to Find Rows with Missing Values</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Any time you join tables, it’s wise to investigate whether the key values in one table appear in the other, and which values are missing, if any. Discrepancies happen for all sorts of reasons. Some data may have changed over time. For example, a table of new products will likely contain codes that aren’t present in an older product table. Or there could be problems such as a clerical errors or incomplete output from the database. All this is important context for making correct inferences about the data.</p>&#13;
<p>When you have only a handful of rows, eyeballing the data is an easy way to look for rows with missing data, as we did in the previous join examples. For large tables, you need a better strategy: filtering to show all rows without a match. To do this, we employ the keyword <code>NULL</code>.</p>&#13;
<p>In SQL, <code>NULL</code> is a special value that represents a condition in which there’s no data present or where the data is unknown because it wasn’t included. For example, if a person filling out an address form skips the “Middle Initial” field, rather than storing an empty string in the database, we’d use <code>NULL</code> to represent the unknown value. It’s important to keep in mind that <code>NULL</code> is different from <code>0</code> or an empty string that you’d place in a text column using two quotes (<code>''</code>). Both those values could have some unintended meaning that’s open to misinterpretation, so you use <code>NULL</code> to show that the value is unknown. And unlike <code>0</code> or an empty string, you can use <code>NULL</code> across data types.</p>&#13;
<p>When a SQL join returns empty rows in one of the tables, those columns don’t come back empty but instead come back with the value <code>NULL</code>. In <a href="#listing7-10" id="listinganchor7-10">Listing 7-10</a>, we’ll find those rows by adding a <code>WHERE</code> clause to filter for <code>NULL</code> by using the phrase <code>IS NULL</code> on the <code>id</code> column of the <code>district_2035</code> table. If we wanted to look for columns <em>with</em> data, we’d use <code>IS NOT NULL</code>. </p>&#13;
<pre><code>SELECT *&#13;
FROM district_2020 LEFT JOIN district_2035&#13;
ON district_2020.id = district_2035.id&#13;
WHERE district_2035.id IS NULL;</code></pre>&#13;
<p class="CodeListingCaption"><a id="listing7-10">Listing 7-10</a>: Filtering to show missing values with <code>IS NULL</code></p>&#13;
<p>Now the result of the join shows only the one row from the table on the left of the join that didn’t have a match in the table on the right. This is commonly referred to as an <em>anti-join</em>.</p>&#13;
<pre><code>id     school_2020       id       school_2035 &#13;
-- ------------------- ------ ---------------------&#13;
 5 Dover Middle School</code></pre>&#13;
<p>It’s easy to reverse the output to see rows on the table on the right of the join that have no matches with the table on the left. You’d change the query to use a <code>RIGHT JOIN</code> and modify the <code>WHERE</code> clause to filter on <code>district_2020.id IS NULL</code>. </p>&#13;

<h2 id="h1-501065c07-0006">Understanding the Three Types of Table Relationships</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Part of the science (or art, some may say) of joining tables involves understanding how the database designer intends for the tables to relate, also known as the database’s <em>relational model</em>. There are three types of table relationships: one to one, one to many, and many to many.</p>&#13;
<h3 id="h2-501065c07-0005">One-to-One Relationship</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">In our <code>JOIN</code> example in <a href="#listing7-4">Listing 7-4</a>, there are no duplicate <code>id</code> values in either table: only one row in the <code>district_2020</code> table exists with an <code>id</code> of <code>1</code>, and only one row in the <code>district_2035</code> table has an <code>id</code> of <code>1</code>. That means any given <code>id</code> in either table will find no more than one match in the other table. In database parlance, this is called a <em>one-to-one</em> relationship. Consider another example: joining two tables with state-by-state census data. One table might contain household income data and the other data is about educational attainment. Both tables would have 51 rows (one for each state plus Washington, D.C.), and if we joined them on a key such as state name, state abbreviation, or a standard geography code, we’d have only one match for each key value in each table.</p>&#13;
<h3 id="h2-501065c07-0006">One-to-Many Relationship</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">In a <em>one-to-many</em> relationship, a key value in one table will have multiple matching values in another table’s joined column. Consider a database that tracks automobiles. One table would hold data on manufacturers, with one row each for Ford, Honda, Tesla, and so on. A second table with model names, such as Mustang, Civic, Model 3, and Accord, would have several rows matching each row in the manufacturers’ table.</p>&#13;
<h3 id="h2-501065c07-0007">Many-to-Many Relationship</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">A <em>many-to-many</em> relationship exists when multiple items in one table can relate to multiple items in another table, and vice versa. For example, in a baseball league, each player can be assigned to multiple positions, and each position can be played by multiple players. Because of this complexity, many-to-many relationships usually feature a third, intermediate table in between the two. In the case of the baseball league, a database might have a <code>players</code> table, a <code>positions</code> table, and a third called <code>players_positions</code> that has two columns that support the many-to-many relationship: the <code>id</code> from the <code>players</code> table and the <code>id</code> from the <code>positions</code> table.</p>&#13;
<p>Understanding these relationships is essential because it helps us discern whether the results of queries accurately reflect the structure of the database.</p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-501065c07-0007"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="106" id="Page_106"/>Selecting Specific Columns in a Join</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">So far, we’ve used the asterisk wildcard to select all columns from both tables. That’s okay for quick data checks, but more often you’ll want to specify a subset of columns. You can focus on just the data you want and avoid inadvertently changing the query results if someone adds a new column to a table.</p>&#13;
<p>As you learned in single-table queries, to select particular columns you use the <code>SELECT</code> keyword followed by the desired column names. When joining tables, it’s a best practice to  include the table name along with the column. The reason is that more than one table can contain columns with the same name, which is certainly true of our joined tables so far.</p>&#13;
<p>Consider the following query, which tries to fetch an <code>id</code> column without naming the table: </p>&#13;
<pre><code>SELECT id &#13;
FROM district_2020 LEFT JOIN district_2035&#13;
ON district_2020.id = district_2035.id;</code></pre>&#13;
<p>Because <code>id</code> exists in both <code>district_2020</code> and <code>district_2035</code>, the server throws an error that appears in pgAdmin’s results pane: <code>column reference "id" is ambiguous</code>. It’s not clear which table <code>id</code> belongs to.</p>&#13;
<p>To fix the error, we need to add the table name in front of each column we’re querying, as we do in the <code>ON</code> clause. <a href="#listing7-11" id="listinganchor7-11">Listing 7-11</a> shows the syntax, specifying that we want the <code>id</code> column from <code>district_2020</code>. We’re also fetching the school names from both tables.</p>&#13;
<pre><code>SELECT district_2020.id,&#13;
       district_2020.school_2020,&#13;
       district_2035.school_2035&#13;
FROM district_2020 LEFT JOIN district_2035&#13;
ON district_2020.id = district_2035.id&#13;
ORDER BY district_2020.id;</code></pre>&#13;
<p class="CodeListingCaption"><a id="listing7-11">Listing 7-11</a>: Querying specific columns in a join</p>&#13;
<p>We simply prefix each column name with the table it comes from, and the rest of the query syntax is the same. The result returns the requested columns from each table:</p>&#13;
<pre><code>id      school_2020           school_2035      &#13;
-- --------------------- ----------------------&#13;
 1 Oak Street School     Oak Street School&#13;
 2 Roosevelt High School Roosevelt High School&#13;
 5 Dover Middle School   &#13;
 6 Webutuck High School  Webutuck High School</code></pre>&#13;
<p>We can also add the <code>AS</code> keyword we used previously with census data to make it clear in the results that the <code>id</code> column is from <code>district_2020</code>. The syntax would look like this:</p>&#13;
<pre><code>SELECT district_2020.id AS d20_id, ...</code></pre>&#13;
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="107" id="Page_107"/>This would display the name of the <code>district_2020 id</code> column as <code>d20_id</code> in the results.</p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-501065c07-0008">Simplifying JOIN Syntax with Table Aliases</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Specifying the table for a column is easy enough, but repeating a lengthy table name for multiple columns clutters your code. One of the best ways to serve your colleagues is to write code that’s readable, which should generally not involve making them wade through a table name repeated over 25 columns! One way to write more concise code is to use a shorthand approach called <em>table aliases</em>.</p>&#13;
<p>To create a table alias, we place a character or two after the table name when we declare it in the <code>FROM</code> clause. (You can use more than a couple of characters for an alias, but if the goal is to simplify code, don’t go overboard.) Those characters then serve as an alias we can use instead of the full table name anywhere we reference the table in the code. <a href="#listing7-12" id="listinganchor7-12">Listing 7-12</a> demonstrates how this works.</p>&#13;
<pre><code>SELECT d20.id,&#13;
       d20.school_2020,&#13;
       d35.school_2035&#13;
<span class="CodeAnnotationHang" aria-label="annotation1">1</span> FROM district_2020 AS d20 LEFT JOIN district_2035 AS d35&#13;
ON d20.id = d35.id&#13;
ORDER BY d20.id;</code></pre>&#13;
<p class="CodeListingCaption"><a id="listing7-12">Listing 7-12</a>: Simplifying code with table aliases</p>&#13;
<p>In the <code>FROM</code> clause, we declare the alias <code>d20</code> to represent <code>district_2020</code> and the alias <code>d35</code> to represent <code>district_2035</code> <span class="CodeAnnotation" aria-label="annotation1">1</span> using the <code>AS</code> keyword. Both aliases are shorter than the table names but still meaningful. Once that’s in place, we can use the aliases instead of the full table names everywhere else in the code. Immediately, our SQL looks more compact, and that’s ideal. Note that the <code>AS</code> keyword is optional here; you can omit it when declaring an alias for both table names and column names.</p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-501065c07-0009">Joining Multiple Tables</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Of course, SQL joins aren’t limited to two tables. We can continue adding tables to the query as long as we have columns with matching values to join on. Let’s say we obtain two more school-related tables and want to join them to <code>district_2020</code> in a three-table join. The <code>district_2020_enrollment</code> table has the number of students per school:</p>&#13;
<pre><code>id    enrollment&#13;
--    ----------&#13;
 1           360&#13;
 2          1001&#13;
 5           450&#13;
 6           927</code></pre>&#13;
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="108" id="Page_108"/>The <code>district_2020_grades</code> table contains the grade levels housed in each building:</p>&#13;
<pre><code>id    grades&#13;

<p>To write the query, we’ll use <a href="#listing7-13" id="listinganchor7-13">Listing 7-13</a> to create the tables, load the data, and run a query to join them to <code>district_2020</code>.</p>&#13;
<pre><code>CREATE TABLE district_2020_enrollment (&#13;

<p class="CodeListingCaption"><a id="listing7-13">Listing 7-13</a>: Joining multiple tables</p>&#13;
<p>After we run the <code>CREATE TABLE</code> and <code>INSERT</code> portions of the script, we have new <code>district_2020_enrollment</code> and <code>district_2020_grades</code> tables, each with records that relate to <code>district_2020</code> from earlier in the chapter. We then connect all three tables.</p>&#13;
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="109" id="Page_109"/>In the <code>SELECT</code> query, we join <code>district_2020</code> to <code>district_2020_enrollment</code> <span class="CodeAnnotation" aria-label="annotation1">1</span> using the tables’ <code>id</code> columns.

Next, the query joins <code>district_2020</code> to <code>district_2020_grades</code>, again on the <code>id</code> columns <span class="CodeAnnotation" aria-label="annotation2">2</span>.</p>&#13;
<p>Our result now includes columns from all three tables:</p>&#13;

 5 Dover Middle School          450 6-8&#13;
 6 Webutuck High School         927 9-12</code></pre>&#13;
<p>If you need to, you can add even more tables to the query using additional joins. You can also join on different columns, depending on the tables’ relationships. Although there is no hard limit in SQL to the number of tables you can join in a single query, some database systems might impose one. Check the documentation.</p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-501065c07-0010">Combining Query Results with Set Operators</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Certain instances require us to re-order our data so that columns from various tables aren’t returned side by side, as a join produces, but brought together into one result. Examples include required input formats for JavaScript-based data visualizations or analysis with libraries used in the R and Python programming languages. One way to manipulate our data this way is to use the ANSI standard SQL <em>set operators</em> <code>UNION</code>, <code>INTERSECT</code>, and <code>EXCEPT</code>. Set operators combine the results of multiple <code>SELECT</code> queries. Here’s a quick look at what each does:</p>&#13;
<ol class="none">&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead"><span class="LiteralBold"><code>UNION</code></span></span>  Given two queries, it appends the rows in the results of the second query to the rows returned by the first query and removes duplicates, producing a combined set of distinct rows. Modifying the syntax to <code>UNION ALL</code> will return all rows, including duplicates.</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead"><span class="LiteralBold"><code>INTERSECT</code></span></span>  Returns only rows that exist in the results of both queries and removes duplicates.</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead"><span class="LiteralBold"><code>EXCEPT</code></span></span>  Returns rows that exist in the results of the first query but not in the results of the second query. Duplicates are removed.</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<p>For each of these, both queries must produce the same number of columns, and the resulting columns from both queries must have compatible data types. Let’s continue using our school district tables for brief examples of how they work.</p>&#13;
<h3 id="h2-501065c07-0008">UNION and UNION ALL</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">In <a href="#listing7-14" id="listinganchor7-14">Listing 7-14</a>, we use <code>UNION</code> to combine queries that retrieve all rows from both <code>district_2020</code> and <code>district_2035</code>.</p>&#13;
<pre><code><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="110" id="Page_110"/>SELECT * FROM district_2020&#13;
<span class="CodeAnnotationHang" aria-label="annotation1">1</span> UNION&#13;
SELECT * FROM district_2035&#13;
<span class="CodeAnnotationHang" aria-label="annotation2">2</span> ORDER BY id;</code></pre>&#13;
<p class="CodeListingCaption"><a id="listing7-14">Listing 7-14</a>: Combining query results with <code>UNION</code></p>&#13;
<p>The query consists of two complete <code>SELECT</code> statements with the <code>UNION</code> keyword <span class="CodeAnnotation" aria-label="annotation1">1</span> placed between them. The <code>ORDER BY</code> <span class="CodeAnnotation" aria-label="annotation2">2</span> on the <code>id</code> column happens after the set operation occurs and thus can’t be listed as part of each <code>SELECT</code>. From our work with this data already, you know that these queries will return several rows that are identical in both tables. But by merging the queries with <code>UNION</code>, our results eliminate duplicates: </p>&#13;
<pre><code>id      school_2020      &#13;
-- ---------------------&#13;
 1 Oak Street School&#13;
 2 Roosevelt High School&#13;
 3 Morrison Elementary&#13;
 4 Chase Magnet Academy&#13;
 5 Dover Middle School&#13;
 6 Webutuck High School</code></pre>&#13;
<p>Notice that the names of the schools are in the column <code>school_2020</code>, which is part of the first query’s results. The school names in the second query’s column <code>school_2035</code> from the <code>district_2035</code> table were simply appended to the results from the first query. For that reason, the columns in the second query must match those in the first and have compatible data types.</p>&#13;
<p>If we want the results to include duplicate rows, we substitute <code>UNION ALL</code> for <code>UNION</code> in the query, as in <a href="#listing7-15" id="listinganchor7-15">Listing 7-15</a>.</p>&#13;
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM district_2020&#13;
UNION ALL&#13;
SELECT * FROM district_2035&#13;
ORDER BY id;</code></pre>&#13;
<p class="CodeListingCaption"><a id="listing7-15">Listing 7-15</a>: Combining query results with <code>UNION ALL</code></p>&#13;
<p>That produces all rows, with duplicates included:</p>&#13;
<pre><code>id      school_2020      &#13;
-- ---------------------&#13;
 1 Oak Street School&#13;

<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="111" id="Page_111"/>Finally, it’s often helpful to customize merged results. You may want to know, for example, which table values in each row came from, or you may want to include or exclude certain columns. <a href="#listing7-16" id="listinganchor7-16">Listing 7-16</a> shows one example using <code>UNION ALL</code>.</p>&#13;
<pre><code><span class="CodeAnnotationHang" aria-label="annotation1">1</span> SELECT '2020' AS year,&#13;
     <span class="CodeAnnotationCode" aria-label="annotation2">2</span> school_2020 AS school&#13;
FROM district_2020&#13;
&#13;
UNION ALL&#13;
&#13;
SELECT '2035' AS year,&#13;
       school_2035&#13;
FROM district_2035&#13;
ORDER BY school, year;</code></pre>&#13;
<p class="CodeListingCaption"><a id="listing7-16">Listing 7-16</a>: Customizing a <code>UNION</code> query</p>&#13;
<p>In the first query’s <code>SELECT</code> statement <span class="CodeAnnotation" aria-label="annotation1">1</span>, we designate the string <code>2020</code> as the value to fill a column named <code>year</code>. We also do this in the second query using <code>2035</code> as the string. This is similar to the technique you employed in the section “Adding a Value to a Column During Import” in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 5">Chapter 5</span>. Then, we rename the <code>school_2020</code> column <span class="CodeAnnotation" aria-label="annotation2">2</span> as <code>school</code> because it will show schools from both years.</p>&#13;
<p>Execute the query to see the results:</p>&#13;
<pre><code>year        school         &#13;
---- --------------------&#13;
2035 Chase Magnet Academy&#13;
2020 Dover Middle School&#13;
2035 Morrison Elementary&#13;
2020 Oak Street School&#13;
2035 Oak Street School&#13;
2020 Roosevelt High School&#13;
2035 Roosevelt High School&#13;
2020 Webutuck High School&#13;
2035 Webutuck High School</code></pre>&#13;
<p>Now our query produces a year designation for each school, and we can see, for example, that the row with Dover Middle School comes from the result of querying the <code>district_2020</code> table.</p>&#13;
<h3 id="h2-501065c07-0009">INTERSECT and EXCEPT</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Now that you know how to use <code>UNION</code>, you can apply the same concepts to <code>INTERSECT</code> and <code>EXCEPT</code>. <a href="#listing7-17" id="listinganchor7-17">Listing 7-17</a> shows both, which you can run separately to see how the results differ.</p>&#13;
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM district_2020&#13;
<span class="CodeAnnotationHang" aria-label="annotation1">1</span> INTERSECT&#13;
SELECT * FROM district_2035&#13;
ORDER BY id;&#13;
&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" title="112" id="Page_112"/>SELECT * FROM district_2020&#13;
<span class="CodeAnnotationHang" aria-label="annotation2">2</span> EXCEPT&#13;
SELECT * FROM district_2035&#13;
ORDER BY id;</code></pre>&#13;
<p class="CodeListingCaption"><a id="listing7-17">Listing 7-17</a>: Combining query results with <code>INTERSECT</code> and <code>EXCEPT</code></p>&#13;
<p>The query using <code>INTERSECT</code> <span class="CodeAnnotation" aria-label="annotation1">1</span> returns just the rows that exist in the results of both queries and eliminates duplicates:</p>&#13;
<pre><code>id  school_2020      &#13;
-- --------------&#13;
 1 Oak Street School&#13;
 2 Roosevelt High School&#13;
 6 Webutuck High School</code></pre>&#13;
<p>The query using <code>EXCEPT</code> <span class="CodeAnnotation" aria-label="annotation2">2</span> returns rows that exist in the first query but not in the second, also eliminating duplicates if present:</p>&#13;
<pre><code>id     school_2020     &#13;
-- -------------------&#13;
 5 Dover Middle School</code></pre>&#13;
<p> Along with <code>UNION</code>, queries using <code>INTERSECT</code> and <code>EXCEPT</code> give you plenty of ability to arrange and examine your data.</p>&#13;
<p>Finally, let’s return briefly to joins to see how you can perform calculations on numbers in different tables.</p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-501065c07-0011">Performing Math on Joined Table Columns</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">The math functions we explored in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 6">Chapter 6</span> are just as usable when working with joined tables. We need to include the table name when referencing a column in an operation, as we did when selecting table columns. If you work with any data that has a new release at regular intervals, you’ll find this concept useful for joining a newly released table to an older one and exploring how values have changed.</p>&#13;
<p>That’s certainly what I and many journalists do each time a new set of census data is released. We’ll load the new data and try to find patterns in the growth or decline of the population, income, education, and other indicators. Let’s look at how to do this by revisiting the <code>us_counties_pop_est_2019</code> table we created in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 5">Chapter 5</span> and loading similar county data that shows 2010 county population estimates into a new table. To make the table, import the data, and join it to the 2019 estimates, run the code in <a href="#listing7-18" id="listinganchor7-18">Listing 7-18</a>.</p>&#13;
<pre><code><span class="CodeAnnotationHang" aria-label="annotation1">1</span> CREATE TABLE us_counties_pop_est_2010 (&#13;
    state_fips text, &#13;
    county_fips text,&#13;
    region smallint,&#13;
    state_name text,&#13;
    county_name text,&#13;
    <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="113" id="Page_113"/>estimates_base_2010 integer,&#13;
    CONSTRAINT counties_2010_key PRIMARY KEY (state_fips, county_fips)&#13;
);&#13;
&#13;
<span class="CodeAnnotationHang" aria-label="annotation2">2</span> COPY us_counties_pop_est_2010&#13;
FROM '<em>C:\YourDirectory\</em>us_counties_pop_est_2010.csv'&#13;
WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER);&#13;
&#13;
<span class="CodeAnnotationHang" aria-label="annotation3">3</span> SELECT c2019.county_name,&#13;
       c2019.state_name,&#13;
       c2019.pop_est_2019 AS pop_2019,&#13;
       c2010.estimates_base_2010 AS pop_2010,&#13;
       c2019.pop_est_2019 - c2010.estimates_base_2010 AS raw_change,&#13;
     <span class="CodeAnnotationCode" aria-label="annotation4">4</span> round( (c2019.pop_est_2019::numeric - c2010.estimates_base_2010) &#13;
           / c2010.estimates_base_2010 * 100, 1 ) AS pct_change&#13;
FROM us_counties_pop_est_2019 AS c2019&#13;
    JOIN us_counties_pop_est_2010 AS c2010&#13;
<span class="CodeAnnotationHang" aria-label="annotation5">5</span> ON c2019.state_fips = c2010.state_fips&#13;
    AND c2019.county_fips = c2010.county_fips&#13;
<span class="CodeAnnotationHang" aria-label="annotation6">6</span> ORDER BY pct_change DESC;</code></pre>&#13;
<p class="CodeListingCaption"><a id="listing7-18">Listing 7-18</a>: Performing math on joined census tables</p>&#13;
<p>In this code, we’re building on earlier foundations. We have the familiar <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statement <span class="CodeAnnotation" aria-label="annotation1">1</span>, which for this exercise includes state, county, and region codes, and we have columns with the names of the states and counties. It also includes an <code>estimates_base_2010</code> column that has the Census Bureau’s estimated 2010 population for each county (the Census Bureau modifies its complete, every-10-year count to create a base number for comparisons with estimates later in the decade). The <code>COPY</code> statement <span class="CodeAnnotation" aria-label="annotation2">2</span> imports a CSV file with the census data; you can find <em>us_counties_pop_est_2010.csv</em> along with all of the book’s resources at <a href="https://nostarch.com/practical-sql-2nd-edition/" class="LinkURL">https://nostarch.com/practical-sql-2nd-edition/</a>. After you’ve downloaded the file, you’ll need to change the file path to the location where you saved it.</p>&#13;
<p>When you’ve finished the import, you should have a table named <code>us_counties_pop_est_2010</code> with 3,142 rows. Now that we have tables with population estimates for 2010 and 2019, it makes sense to calculate the percent change in population for each county between those years. Which counties have led the nation in growth? Which ones have seen a decline in population?</p>&#13;
<p>We’ll use the percent change formula we used in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 6">Chapter 6</span> to get the answer. The <code>SELECT</code> statement <span class="CodeAnnotation" aria-label="annotation3">3</span> includes the county and state names from the 2019 table, which is aliased with <code>c2019</code>. Next are the population estimate columns from the 2019 and 2010 tables, both renamed using <code>AS</code> to simplify their names in the results. To get the raw change in population, we subtract the 2010 estimates base from the 2019 estimates, and to find the percent change, we employ the formula <span class="CodeAnnotation" aria-label="annotation4">4</span> and round the result to one decimal point.</p>&#13;
<p>We join by matching values in two columns in both tables: <code>state_fips</code> and <code>county_fips</code> <span class="CodeAnnotation" aria-label="annotation5">5</span>. The reason to join on two columns instead of one is that in both tables, the combination of a state code and a county code <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="114" id="Page_114"/>represents a unique county. We combine the two conditions using the <code>AND</code> logical operator. Using that syntax, rows are joined when both conditions are satisfied. Finally, we sort the results in descending order by percent change <span class="CodeAnnotation" aria-label="annotation6">6</span> so we can see the fastest growers at the top.</p>&#13;
<p>That’s a lot of work, but it’s worth it. Here’s what the first five rows of the results indicate:</p>&#13;
<pre><code>county_name       state_name    pop_2019  pop_2010  raw_change  pct_change &#13;
---------------   ----------    --------  --------  ----------  ----------&#13;
McKenzie County   North Dakota     15024      6359        8665       136.3&#13;
Loving County     Texas              169        82          87       106.1&#13;
Williams County   North Dakota     37589     22399       15190        67.8&#13;
Hays County       Texas           230191    157103       73088        46.5&#13;
Wasatch County    Utah             34091     23525       10566        44.9</code></pre>&#13;
<p>Two counties, McKenzie in North Dakota and Loving in Texas, more than doubled their populations from 2010 to 2019, with other North Dakota and Texas counties showing substantial gains. Each of these places has its own story. For McKenzie County and others in North Dakota, a boom in oil and gas exploration in the Bakken geological formation is behind the surge. That’s just one valuable insight we’ve extracted from this analysis and a starting point for understanding national population trends.</p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-501065c07-0012">Wrapping Up</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Given that table relationships are foundational to database architecture, learning to join tables in queries allows you to handle many of the more complex datasets you’ll encounter. Experimenting with the different types of joins on tables can tell you a great deal about how data has been gathered and reveal when there’s a quality issue. Make trying various joins a routine part of your exploration of a new dataset.</p>&#13;
<p>Moving forward, we’ll continue building on these bigger concepts as we drill deeper into finding information in datasets and working with the nuances of handling data types and making sure we have quality data. But first, we’ll look at one more foundational element: employing best practices to build reliable, speedy databases with SQL.</p>&#13;

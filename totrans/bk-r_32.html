<div class="image"><img src="../images/common-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This appendix provides more detail on where to find R and how to install it and its contributed packages. R is available through CRAN—the Comprehensive R Archive Network—accessed through the R website at <em><a href="https://www.r-project.org/">https://www.r-project.org/</a></em>. I’ll cover only the fundamentals here, but you’ll find a substantial amount of information in the R FAQ by Hornik (<a href="ref.xhtml#ref33">2015</a>) at <em><a href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html">http://CRAN.R-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html</a></em>. This should be your first port of call if you need help with installing R and its packages. Installation of R and its contributed packages is dealt with in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Sections 2</a> and <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05">5</a> of the FAQ, respectively.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="app01lev1sec96"><strong>A.1 Downloading and Installing R</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Once at the R website, click the <strong>CRAN mirror</strong> link in the welcoming text or the <strong>CRAN</strong> link under the Download heading on the left, as shown in <a href="app01.xhtml#appAfig1">Figure A-1</a>, and a page will load that asks you to select a CRAN mirror.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_738"/><img src="../images/fa-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figt"><em><a id="appAfig1"/>Figure A-1: The R home page</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Pick one close to your geographical location and click the link. <a href="app01.xhtml#appAfig2">Figure A-2</a> shows my local mirror, which is at the University of Auckland; yours will look the same.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/fa-02.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figt"><em><a id="appAfig2"/>Figure A-2: A CRAN mirror site. This is where you’ll find the various download links.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_739"/>Then click the link for your operating system.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• If you’re a Windows user, click the Windows link, and from that page choose the installation file (the binary executable) for the <code>base</code> distribution. Double-click the executable file and follow the instructions in the installation wizard. You’ll want either the 32- or 64-bit version depending on your current Windows installation—you can find out which you have by going to Control Panel → System.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• If you’re a Mac user, click the Mac OS X link and you’ll be taken to a page with the packaged binary files. At the time of writing, there are still two versions available: one for OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) and later, and another for OS X 10.6 to 10.8 (this file has the <em>snowleopard</em> designation), though support for Snow Leopard is being phased out. Download the correct file for your operating system. Once the download is complete, double-clicking it will immediately launch the installer; follow the instructions therein. I also recommend getting the XQuartz window system, freely downloadable from <em><a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/">http://xquartz.macosforge.org/</a></em>, which provides support for additional devices for graphics.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• Linux users will be taken to a subdirectory with folders named after operating systems such as Debian or Ubuntu. Click the link relevant to you and you’ll be taken to a page providing step-by-step command line instructions for installing R.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="app01lev1sec97"><strong>A.2 Using Packages</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">R <em>packages</em> (or <em>libraries</em>) are collections of code that hold data and functionality used in R. It’s essential to get comfortable with loading these libraries to access certain features and commands.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Packages come in three flavors. Those that make up the core functionality of the software are included with the installation and are automatically loaded when you open R. Also, a handful of <em>recommended</em> packages are included with a typical R installation but aren’t automatically loaded. Finally, a huge collection of user-contributed packages—more than 7000 at the time of writing—extend R’s applications vastly.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="app01lev2sec273"><strong><em>A.2.1 Base Packages</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The <em>base packages</em> provide the essential syntax and commands for programming, computing, and graphics production, as well as the built-in data sets, basic arithmetic, and statistical functionality, and they are immediately available when you start R. At the time of writing, there are 14.</p>&#13;
<p class="programsn">base       compiler   datasets   grDevices   graphics  grid   methods<br/>parallel   splines    stats      stats4      tlctk     tools  utils</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You’ll find a brief description each of these base packages in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05lev2sec49">Section 5.1.1</a> of Kurt Hornik’s R FAQ.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="app01lev2sec274"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_740"/><strong><em>A.2.2 Recommended Packages</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">At the time of writing, there are 15 <em>recommended packages</em>, as noted in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05lev2sec50">Section 5.1.2</a> of the R FAQ. These packages are included with any standard R installation, and they extend the functionality of the base packages to include slightly more specialized (yet still ubiquitous) statistical methods and computational tools. In this book, you’ll only be using <code>MASS</code> and <code>boot</code> from this list.</p>&#13;
<p class="programsn">KernSmooth   MASS      Matrix     boot   class   cluster<br/>codetools    foreign   lattice    mgcv   nlme    nnet<br/>rpart        spatial   survival</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">These recommended packages <em>aren’t</em> loaded automatically. If you want to access functions or data sets from these packages, load them manually with a call to <code>library</code>. For example, to access the data sets available as part of <code>MASS</code>, execute the following at the prompt:</p>&#13;
<pre>R&gt; library("MASS")</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Some packages provide a short welcome message upon loading, and R always informs you of any masking (see <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12lev2sec110">Section 12.3.1</a>) that has occurred.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When you close your current R session, the package will close too, so you need to reload it if you open another instance of R and want to use it again. If you decide you no longer need a package in any given session and want to unload it to, for example, avoid any potential masking issues, use <code>detach</code> as follows:</p>&#13;
<pre>R&gt; detach("package:MASS",unload=TRUE)</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can find topics and technical details concerning package loading and unloading in <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09lev1sec31">Sections 9.1</a> and <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12lev2sec110">12.3.1</a> of this book.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="app01lev2sec275"><strong><em>A.2.3 Contributed Packages</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">On top of these built-in and recommended packages, there’s a massive collection of user-contributed packages available through CRAN, serving all kinds of purposes and applications in statistics and mathematics, computing, and graphics. If you navigate to your local CRAN mirror site, the Packages link on the left of the page (see <a href="app01.xhtml#appAfig2">Figure A-2</a>) will take you to a page with further links that provide up-to-date lists of all the available packages on CRAN. You’ll also find the useful CRAN Task Views web page, which is a collection of subject-specific articles giving an overview of relevant packages, as shown in <a href="app01.xhtml#appAfig3">Figure A-3</a>. This is a great way to get familiar with the types of specialized analyses that are possible in R.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Because of the sheer number of available packages, naturally R doesn’t include them all upon its installation, and as a researcher you’ll only ever be interested in a relatively small subset of methods at any one time.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_741"/><img src="../images/fa-03.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figt"><em><a id="appAfig3"/>Figure A-3: The CRAN Task Views web page. Each article discusses prominent CRAN packages in use in the field.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In this book, you’ll make use of a handful of contributed packages. Some are used to access certain data sets or objects, and others are used for their unique functionality or to illustrate statistical methodology. They are listed here:</p>&#13;
<p class="programsn1">car             faraway   GGally     ggplot2   ggvis<br/>gridExtra       ks        misc3d     mvtnorm   rgl<br/>scatterplot3d   shape     spatstat   tseries</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When you want access to any contributed package, you need an Internet connection to first download and install it. Packages are generally less than a few megabytes in size. Once a package is installed, you then load it with the usual call to <code>library</code> to access the relevant functionality. For the packages listed above, you’ll be prompted to do this when necessary in the relevant parts of the book.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You’ll now look at a few ways to perform a package download and installation for R, using the <code>ks</code> package (<a href="ref.xhtml#ref20">Duong, 2007</a>) as an example.</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="notes">NOTE</span></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>Contributed R packages tend to be of good quality in terms of correctness, speed and efficiency, and user-friendliness. Although there are fundamental compatibility checks that must be passed before a submitted package is made available on CRAN, passing them isn’t a sign of the overall quality and usability of a given package. You can gauge that only by using the package, studying its documentation, and seeking out any related publications.</em></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="app01lev3sec130"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_742"/><strong>Finding Packages on CRAN</strong></h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Every R package on CRAN has its own standard web page, providing the direct links to the downloadable files and important information about the package. Locate the package name on one of the lists on CRAN and click it, or do a quick Google search for, in our case, <em>ks r cran</em>. <a href="app01.xhtml#appAfig4">Figure A-4</a> shows the top of the web page for <code>ks</code>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/fa-04.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figt"><em><a id="appAfig4"/>Figure A-4: Descriptive information on the CRAN web page for the</em> <code>ks</code> <em>package</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Along with basic information such as the version number and the maintainer’s name and contact information, you’ll see the Depends field. This is important for installation; if the R package you’re interested in is dependent on other contributed packages (not all are), then you also need to install those packages for your package to install successfully.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Looking at <a href="app01.xhtml#appAfig4">Figure A-4</a>, you can see that your R version needs to be later than 1.4, that <code>ks</code> requires <code>KernSmooth</code> (already installed—it’s one of the recommended packages noted in <a href="app01.xhtml#app01lev2sec274">Section A.2.2</a>), and that it also needs <code>misc3d</code>, <code>mvtnorm</code>, and <code>rgl</code>. Fortunately, if you install an R package directly from R, the dependencies are also installed automatically.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="app01lev3sec131"><strong>Installing Packages at the Prompt</strong></h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The quickest way to download and install a contributed R package is to use the <code>install.packages</code> command directly from the R prompt. Starting with a fresh installation of R, I see the following on my iMac:</p>&#13;
<pre>R&gt; install.packages("ks")<br/>--- Please select a CRAN mirror for use in this session ---<br/>also installing the dependencies 'misc3d', 'mvtnorm', 'rgl'<br/><br/>--<span class="codeitalic">snip</span>--</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_743"/>You may first be asked to choose a CRAN mirror. The list pops up and defaults to the secure HTTPS servers only; choosing HTTP will switch to the unsecured ones. I chose HTTP, found the New Zealand mirror, and clicked OK, as shown in <a href="app01.xhtml#appAfig5">Figure A-5</a>. Once you’ve done this, your selected mirror will remain set as the go-to site until you reset it; see <a href="app01.xhtml#app01lev2sec276">Section A.4.1</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/fa-05.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figt"><em><a id="appAfig5"/>Figure A-5: Pop-up windows for selecting a CRAN mirror site to use for downloading contributed packages. Left: Optional selection of HTTP servers (as opposed to HTTPS). Right: Selection of my local HTTP mirror.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">After you click <strong>OK</strong>, R lists any dependencies that will also be downloaded and installed and then presents download notifications for each package (in the snipped output).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Some additional notes are warranted:</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• You need to install a package only once, and it will save to your hard drive to be loaded with a call to <code>library</code> as usual.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• You might be prompted to use or create a local folder on your computer to store installed packages. This is done to ensure R knows where to get packages from when they’re requested with <code>library</code>. Agreeing to this means you have a user-specific library of packages, which is generally a good idea.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• There are a number of optional arguments for <code>install.packages</code>; see the help file given by a call to <code>?install.packages</code> at the prompt. For example, if you want to specify a CRAN mirror in the console, supply the relevant URL as a character string to the <code>repos</code> argument, or if you want to prevent dependencies from installing, use the <code>dependencies</code> argument.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_744"/>• You can also install R packages from source, that is, from the uncompiled code, which may have more recent updates than the precompiled binary version of the package. If you’re an OS X user, recent versions of R will ask you whether you’d like to download packages from source for packages with versions available that are more recent than the precompiled binary version. To do so, you need certain command line tools installed on your system; if the download fails, you can stick with the binary version by answering <code>n</code> (“no”) at the <code>download from source</code> prompt.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="app01lev3sec132"><strong>Installing Packages with the GUI</strong></h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The basic R graphical user interface (GUI) used in this book gives you the option to download and install contributed packages from the console using menu items. Here, you’ll look briefly at the Windows and OS X versions.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">On Windows, click the <strong>Packages</strong> → <strong>Install package(s)...</strong> menu item, shown on the left of <a href="app01.xhtml#appAfig6">Figure A-6</a>. Select a CRAN mirror and a tall window will open, listing all available packages in alphabetical order. Scroll to select the package you’re interested in. You can see my selection of <code>ks</code> on the right of <a href="app01.xhtml#appAfig6">Figure A-6</a>. Click <strong>OK</strong> to download and install the packages and dependencies.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/fa-06.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figt"><em><a id="appAfig6"/>Figure A-6: Initiating download and installation of a contributed R package (and any missing dependencies automatically) via GUI menus in Windows</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For OS X R, click the <strong>Packages &amp; Data</strong> → <strong>Package Installer</strong> item in the OS X menu bar, as shown on the top of <a href="app01.xhtml#appAfig7">Figure A-7</a>. When the package installer opens, click the <strong>Get List</strong> button to bring up the table of available packages. Select the package you want, being sure to select the <strong>Install Dependencies</strong> box near the bottom of the installer before clicking <strong>Install Selected</strong>. R will then download and install everything it needs, including any dependencies, as shown on the bottom of <a href="app01.xhtml#appAfig7">Figure A-7</a>. You can select more than one package. Note that the options on the bottom left of the installer allow you to choose exactly where the installed packages will be stored; if you’re a nonadmin user, you may need to create a user-specific library, as mentioned earlier.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_745"/><img src="../images/fa-07.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figt"><em><a id="appAfig7"/>Figure A-7: Initiating download and installation of a contributed R package (and any missing dependencies) using the GUI-based package installer in OS X</em></p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="app01lev3sec133"><strong>Installing Packages Using Local Files</strong></h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Lastly, you can download the required package files from CRAN through your Internet browser as you’d download anything else, store them on your local drive, and then direct R to those local files.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">On the CRAN web page for <code>ks</code>, you’ll find a Downloads section as shown in <a href="app01.xhtml#appAfig8">Figure A-8</a>. For Linux, choose the Package source file. For Windows or OS X, choose the corresponding <em>.zip</em> or <em>.pkg</em> file labeled <em>r-release</em>. The <em>r-oldrel</em> and <em>r-devel</em> versions should be used only if you’re experiencing compatibility issues. The Old sources link holds archived source files for old versions.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">On Windows, select <strong>Packages</strong> → <strong>Install package(s) from local zip files...</strong> (shown on the left of <a href="app01.xhtml#appAfig6">Figure A-6</a>). This will open a file browser so you can navigate to the downloaded <em>.zip</em> file for the package; R will do the rest.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_746"/><img src="../images/fa-08.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figt"><em><a id="appAfig8"/>Figure A-8: The Downloads section of the CRAN web page for</em> <code>ks</code></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">On OS X, once you’ve downloaded the <em>.pkg</em> file, select <strong>Packages &amp; Data</strong> → <strong>Package Installer</strong>. Use the drop-down menu at the top of the installer to select <strong>Local Binary Package</strong>, as shown in <a href="app01.xhtml#appAfig9">Figure A-9</a>. To open a file browser to find the local file, you need to click the <strong>Install...</strong> button at the bottom of the installer. R will take it from there.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/fa-09.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figt"><em><a id="appAfig9"/>Figure A-9: Using the package installer on OS X to install an R package from a local file</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">It’s important to know that this method <em>does not</em> automatically install any dependencies. You’ll also need to install any packages your package depends on, any dependencies of those, and so on—so be sure to check the Depends field on the CRAN package web page, as noted earlier.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">It’s far easier to use <code>install.packages</code> directly from the R prompt, or through the GUI, to automate this process. You need to do local file installations only if the automatic methods fail for some reason, if you’re installing a package that isn’t on CRAN (or any other readily accessible repository—see <a href="app01.xhtml#app01lev2sec277">Section A.4.2</a>), or if the package isn’t directly available for your operating system.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="app01lev1sec98"><strong>A.3 Updating R and Installed Packages</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">There are roughly four new releases of R a year that address functionality, compatibility issues, and bug fixes. It’s a good idea to keep up-to-date with these new releases. The R project home page and any CRAN mirror site will tell you the latest release, and you can execute <code>news()</code> at the R prompt for details on what’s new.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_747"/>Contributed R packages are also periodically updated and new package files uploaded to CRAN. Packages you’ve installed won’t auto-update, so it’s up to you to update them. It’s difficult to predict how often such updates will be released, since it’s completely up to the maintainers, but it’s worth checking for newer versions of the packages you’ve installed every few months or, at the very least, when you upgrade your version of R.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Checking for package updates is easy. A simple call to <code>update.packages()</code>, with no arguments, will systematically look through your installed packages and flag any that have more recent versions available.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For example, on my current installation, executing the following tells me that a later version of <code>MASS</code> is available (along with several other packages not shown in this snipped output).</p>&#13;
<pre>R&gt; update.packages()<br/>MASS :<br/> Version 7.3-43 installed in /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/<br/>                              Resources/library<br/> Version 7.3-44 available at http://cran.stat.auckland.ac.nz<br/>Update (y/N/c)? y<br/><br/>--<span class="codeitalic">snip</span>--</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Enter <code>y</code> to download the updated package from CRAN. If there are several packages with updates available, R will ask you one at a time whether you’d like to update, and you have to enter <code>y</code> (or <code>N</code> or <code>c</code>) for each.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can also perform package updates using the R GUI menus (or manually with local file installation). In Windows, select <strong>Packages</strong> → <strong>Update packages...</strong> to open a list of available updates to your current packages. On OS X, a column in the populated table in the package installer provides information on the version of every package you currently have installed, as well as the version currently on CRAN, giving you the option to install the more recent version. There’s also the Update All button, which is what you’d typically use.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="app01lev1sec99"><strong>A.4 Using Other Mirrors and Repositories</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Sometimes you might want to change the CRAN mirror associated with your typical package installation process or, indeed, change the target repository itself to one other than CRAN—there are several options.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="app01lev2sec276"><strong><em>A.4.1 Switching CRAN Mirror</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You’ll rarely need to change your CRAN mirror, but you might want to if, say, your usual mirror site is inaccessible for some reason or you want to use R from a different location. To query your currently set repository, call <code>getOption</code> with <code>"repos"</code>.</p>&#13;
<pre><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_748"/>R&gt; getOption("repos")<br/>                             CRAN<br/>"http://cran.stat.auckland.ac.nz"</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">To change this to, say, the mirror at the University of Melbourne, simply assign the new URL to the <code>repos</code> component in a call to <code>options</code> as follows:</p>&#13;
<pre>R&gt; options(repos="http://cran.ms.unimelb.edu.au/")</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Any subsequent usage of <code>install.packages</code> or <code>update.packages</code> will now use this Australian mirror for downloads.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="app01lev2sec277"><strong><em>A.4.2 Other Package Repositories</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">CRAN isn’t the only repository of R packages. Other repositories include Bioconductor (see <em><a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/">https://www.bioconductor.org/</a></em>), Omegahat (see <em><a href="http://www.omegahat.org/">http://www.omegahat.org/</a></em>), and R-Forge (see <em><a href="https://r-forge.r-project.org/">https://r-forge.r-project.org/</a></em>), and there are several more. These repositories tend to deal with different subjects. Bioconductor, for example, hosts packages that deal with DNA microarray and other genomic analysis methodologies; Omegahat hosts packages that focus on web- and Java-based applications.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In terms of general statistical analyses, CRAN is the go-to repository for most users. To learn more about the other repositories, you can visit the associated websites.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="app01lev1sec100"><strong>A.5 Citing and Writing Packages</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">It’s important that the work put into R and its packages is recognized in the appropriate way when the software is used in, for example, data analysis as part of your research projects. Indeed, when you get to the stage where you’re thinking about writing your own packages, it pays to be aware of the following.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="app01lev2sec278"><strong><em>A.5.1 Citing R and Contributed Packages</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">For citing R and/or its packages, the <code>citation</code> command produces the relevant output.</p>&#13;

<p class="noindent">Once you become an R expert, you may find yourself with a suite of functions, data sets, and objects that others might find useful or that you use often enough to warrant packaging them up in a standardized, easily loadable format. There’s certainly no obligation to submit your packages to CRAN or any other repository, but if you do aim to do so, note that there <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_750"/>are rather strict requirements to assure users of the stability and compatibility of your package.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you’re interested in constructing your own installable R package, see the official <em>Writing R Extensions</em> manual, accessible on any CRAN mirror site by clicking the Manuals link under Documentation on the left of the home page; you can see this link in <a href="app01.xhtml#appAfig2">Figure A-2</a>. If you’re interested, you may also want to seek out the book by Wickham (<a href="ref.xhtml#ref74">2015<em>b</em></a>), which provides useful instruction on the R package-writing process and associated dos and don’ts.</p>&#13;

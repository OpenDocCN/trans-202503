    Since the captain had gone so far as to hire Frank in person, he hadn’t expected
    to run into any officers. If the captain didn’t trust his officers, either they
    were under suspicion—so he’d shuffle them to some case far across the city—or
    they simply weren’t good enough. But, from the looks of it, someone was on the
    case and Frank was already behind.

    arrays with an almost fanatical devotion. They organized everything into linear
    structures with clearly labeled indexes for each element. As he passed barn #0,
    Frank noted 15 pig troughs, each capable of storing one serving of food. A farm

    separate doors, you can walk up to any pen and take an animal out or put one in.
    Easy access to any storage location. Saves hours of wrangling.”

    transportation, there were few places that would rent you a cart, and fewer still

    slipped out of the barn and found the cart lot. As he expected, the lot was organized

    The carts in positions #2 and #4 had 10 pens apiece, so were too large to fit
    Notation’s description. But slot #8 held a six-pen ArrayCart, its wheels still
    coated with fresh mud.'

    ArrayCart. A scattering of straw covered the floor, but the cart was otherwise
    empty. Frank opened each pen in turn, scanning the empty storage spaces for any
    clues. Then, getting down on his hands and knees, he sifted through the straw
    until he found a few scraps of parchment.

    as the scrolls were unloaded. Only two of the pieces contained writing, and those
    appeared to be from ledgers. It wasn’t exactly a solid lead, but it tied the cart
    to the crime.

    around the driver’s seat. The seat itself gave him his first real clue. There
    he found a few black and orange threads caught by the seat’s splintered wood.
    From the vividness of the colors alone, Frank could tell the cloak must have been
    new. Satisfied, he pocketed the threads and stepped down from the cart.

    Around the cart was a stench of rotting fish. He sniffed lightly, following the
    smell, and arrived at the mud-caked wheels. He took a great, deep sniff and immediately
    regretted it. The smell of rotting eel emanating from the mud was as unmistakable
    as it was unpleasant.

- en: The structure of an array means you can access any value (or element) within
    the array, whether to write to it or read from it, by specifying its location,
    or *index*, within the array. Many programming languages use 0-indexed arrays,
    which means the first value of the array resides at index 0, the second at index
    1, and so forth. Commonly, you reference the value at index *i* of array *A* as
    *A*[*i*]; for example, the third element of array *A* would be *A*[2] and equal
    to 19.

    cells in the capital’s police station yesterday. The king personally suggested

    Each station is equipped with an array of four to eight holding cells, depending
    on the size of the local criminal population.

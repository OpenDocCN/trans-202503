    old computational prisons used to rely on their bizarre structure as much as on
    guards. Potential escapees think twice about sneaking through a door when they
    don’t know what lies on the other side: freedom or the guard’s breakroom.'

    from the end of his staff, lighting up the completely unremarkable room.

    what Frank already knew: the entire structure was a grid of rooms, each with doors
    to only some of its neighbors. They would have to navigate from room to room.
    But since they didn’t know which rooms had doors between them, they would have
    to search out a path as they went.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “A search?” asked Socks. “For what?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “The papers, of course,” responded Frank. He had no doubt that the papers were
    stashed here. An abandoned prison provided an ideal location for stashing stolen
    goods, clearly surpassing the more commonly used warehouse. Arguably, the only
    better location would be an abandoned castle—provided it had a moat. The question
    now was whether they could find the documents and then, if they did, whether the
    documents would provide any valuable clues.

- en: “Not another breadth-first search,” protested Socks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Frank considered the idea. In theory, breadth-first worked fine on a grid. Each
    state of the search space was a grid square. Once you explored one grid square,
    you could add its unexplored neighboring squares to your list of things to try.
    Frank could clearly picture the search propagating out over an empty grid, like
    a wave moving across the water.

- en: However, breadth-first search had one major drawback in the physical world—an
    excessive amount of backtracking. Since you were always adding items to the end
    of the list, the next square to explore could be annoyingly far away. Even on
    an empty grid, without walls blocking your path, you could find yourself hiking
    back to the other end of the search space.

    a spell for this one. I’ve been doing depth-first searches through buildings since
    you were in diapers.”

  prefs: []

    search is better suited for walking.”

    ask. Pretending to know algorithms is a recipe for disaster. I’ve seen too many
    rookies tripped up due to bad searches. Good kids, like you.”

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “It’s a simple algorithm,” explained Frank. “Basically we explore deeply down
    each path. We go down one path until we hit a dead end. Then we backtrack to the
    most recent path that we didn’t take and try that. We’ll stop when we find the
    target.

    options, we’ll try north, east, south, then west—avoiding paths we’ve already
    tried, of course. We’ll use the same ordering at every intersection, so we’ll
    always prefer going north if we can. But in this case we have only one option,
    so we start by going south.”

    the options. They had come from the north, so he chose east—the next unexplored
    direction in his ordering. Before leaving the intersection, he retrieved a piece
    of chalk from his pocket and made a small mark on the wall.

    dead end. So far the rooms had either been completely empty or contained only
    the odd prison cell—the cells being enclosures within the rooms. With the complete
    lack of other distinguishing characteristics, Frank chalked a number onto a wall
    in each room and linked that number in his mind to the different mold formations
    he found there.

    horse,” explained Frank as they retraced their steps. This time they chose the
    only unexplored option from room 5, heading west. Unfortunately, they immediately
    hit another dead end—an empty room that sported a complex floral pattern of green
    and blue fuzz.

    exhausted until they had a new option at room 4\. The eastern option was a dead
    end, and they’d already explored the northern option, so this time they went south.

    the occurrence of a large stalactite of orange mold, which they stayed as far
    away from as possible. Orange mold was not known for its structural stability.
    After hitting another dead end, they found themselves retracing their steps all
    the way back to the first intersection in room 2.

    height of the stacks with the mountains of paperwork he had completed through
    the years and did some quick calculations. The captain had never been shy about
    dumping paperwork on him, but Frank had still never seen anything like this. There
    were even mold-stained pages at the bottom of the stacks. Everything felt wrong.

    on the proper use of duck fences. The date and station number marked it as belonging
    to the stolen files. The next sheet, listing noise complaints in the Port of West
    Serial, also came from the stolen collection. It appeared equally random and unhelpful.'

    pages were spotted with a trio of mold-butterflies, but Frank could clearly make
    out supply lists for the castle guards. This ledger could have come only from
    the castle itself. He grabbed another book and found castle guard rotations for
    last November.

    as well.” Frank shifted to an adjacent pile, starting again at the top.

    *Transfer Requests*. Four pages had been torn from the middle of the ledger.

    larger than Frank remembered.

- en: Unlike breadth-first search, depth-first search is an algorithm that explores
    more recently encountered search states first. The algorithm progresses down paths
    until it hits either the target or a dead end.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As with breadth-first search, you can visualize depth-first search as keeping
    a list (in this case, a *stack*) of known but unexplored states. At each step,
    the algorithm picks the next state to explore from the top of the stack. But unlike
    breadth-first search, depth-first search adds new options to the *top* of the
    stack.

    graphs are data structures composed of individual nodes and edges linking those
    nodes. They can be used to represent all sorts of concepts, like city maps, networks
    of criminals, or even the layout of a castle. We’ll use the Kingdom Highway Map
    from the same lecture and start our search from city A—the scene of the crime.

    it has already explored). In this way, the algorithm prioritizes exploring *deeply*
    down paths over exploring *broadly* over the options, as in breadth-first search.

- en: As with breadth-first search, we avoid exploring nodes more than once by keeping
    track of previously visited nodes. This check is particularly important if you
    want to avoid falling into endless loops, checking the same nodes over and over
    again. In the above example, we avoid adding previously seen nodes (either explored
    or unexplored) to our list altogether.

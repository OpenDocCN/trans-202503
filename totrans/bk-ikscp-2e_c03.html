			</header>
			<p class="ChapterIntro"><a id="37"/>After the first introductory chapters, this one
will finally get you started in Inkscape in a serious way. From here on, I will explore practical
topics at a maximum level of detail, leaving no stone
unturned. I cannot know what
features or techniques you will find most useful—that depends on the nature of
your work and your personal tastes.
That's why this book tries to cover <em>everything</em>
Inkscape has to offer.</p>
			<p>In this short chapter, we won't be creating or editing any objects yet. Instead,
we'll prepare our workspace, discuss some useful customizations, and learn
techniques to navigate documents by zooming and panning.</p>
			<a id="section3.1"/><h2>3.1 Preferences</h2>
			<p>
				Inkscape is an extremely configurable piece of software. Throughout this book, I
will mention all sorts of Inkscape <em>preferences</em> you can change to tweak the
program's capabilities and better adapt it to the way you prefer to work. Before you
begin using Inkscape for anything of consequence, let's see how and where all
the various preferences are set and stored in Inkscape.</p>
			<p>All user preferences in Inkscape belong to one of two main classes.</p>
			<a id="section3.1.1"/>
			<h3>
				3.1.1 <a id="38"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_38" title="38"/>Inkscape Preferences</h3>
			<p><em>Inkscape preferences</em> (often called <em>global preferences</em> or just<em>preferences</em>) control those aspects of the program that do not depend on a particular document
you're editing. These include the default behavior of various
tools and shortcuts, details of treatment of various object types, display and color
management options, and so on.</p>
			<p>
				Most of these options are edited in the <span class="ui">Preferences</span> dialog 
(press Shift-Ctrl-P or select <span class="ui"><strong>Edit<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Preferences</strong></span>). Some preferences,
however, are set by commands or shortcuts; for example, when you hide or show scroll bars by
pressing Ctrl-B (or choosing the equivalent command from the <span class="ui">View<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Show/Hide</span> submenu),
that setting is also remembered as a global preference.</p>
			<p>
				Throughout the book, I will discuss specific global options where they are relevant,
referring to the corresponding pages of the <span class="ui">Preferences</span> dialog. The
tree of pages is in the left pane of the dialog; above it, there is a search field where you can type to search within the entire contents of the dialog. Each option in the dialog has
a description; if you need help, just hover your mouse over
an option and read the floating tool tip  (<a href="#fig3-1">Figure 3-1</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig3-1"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="04/inkprefs.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 3-1: A floating tool tip on the <span class="ui">Scrolling</span> page of the <span class="ui">Preferences</span> dialog explains one of the options.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Note that the dialog has no <span class="ui">Save</span> or <span class="ui">Apply</span> button. Most changes take effect
immediately. A few require you to restart Inkscape, which will be mentioned in the
option's description. All global preferences are automatically saved when you exit the
program.</p>
			<p>
				The file where the global preferences are stored is called
preferences.xml; you can view (and change) its location 
from the <span class="ui">Preferences</span> dialog itself, <span class="ui">System</span> page.</p>
			<p>
				Some little-used options have no UI; the only way to set them is by manually editing
the preferences.xml file. This is an XML file with a simple and largely self-explanatory
format. You may need to change a specifically named
attribute of an element with a certain ID, for example, <code>printing</code>. You would
then load that <a id="39"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_39" title="39"/>file in a text editor, search for the string <code>id="printing"</code>,
and edit the value of the specified attribute in that element, for example, by replacing <code>attribute="old"</code> with <code>attribute="new"</code> (note that 
attribute values are always in quotes).</p>
			<a id="section3.1.2"/><h3>3.1.2 Document Properties</h3>
			<p><em>Document properties</em>, unlike global preferences, apply to an individual document. This
category includes the size and orientation of the canvas, the default measurement unit,
various snapping options, status of the snapping grid and guidelines, and so on. Most of these
options are set in the <span class="ui">Document Properties</span> dialog (<a href="#fig3-2">Figure 3-2</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig3-2"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="04/docprefs.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 3-2: The <span class="ui">Page</span> tab of the <span class="ui">Document Properties</span> dialog</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Document properties are automatically saved as part of the Inkscape SVG document for which
they are set. For example, if you change snapping modes in one
document, Inkscape will remember it the next time you load that document, but other documents will 
not be affected. To change the document properties for newly created documents,
edit the document template used to create those documents, as you'll
see in the next section.</p>
			<a id="section3.2"/><h2>
				3.2 <a id="40"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_40" title="40"/>Document Templates</h2>
			<p>When you run Inkscape, it automatically creates a new document for you.
Inkscape's window cannot exist without some document loaded into
it, so if you don't give it an existing document to load, it will create a new one for
you.</p>
			<p>
				Whenever you need to create an empty document from a window where another
document is being edited, just press Ctrl-N or use <span class="ui"><strong>File<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>New</strong></span>.
This will create a document based on the <em>default template</em>. However, Inkscape also has  a number
of other templates that you can use by going to <span class="ui">File<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>New From Template</span>.
Just select a template from the list on the left, set its parameters (such as size)
if necessary, and click <span class="ui"><strong>Create from template</strong></span> (<a href="#fig3-3">Figure 3-3</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig3-3"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="04/new-from-template.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 3-3: The <span class="ui">New From Template</span> dialog</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Inkscape ships with a collection of templates
for standard paper sizes, standard icon and web banner sizes, desktop sizes (for
wallpapers), CD/DVD covers,  business cards, and so on. A template does not have to be empty—it may contain any objects
or document settings that can be useful. For example, look at the <span class="ui">Seamless pattern</span> template that has extensive instructions (top left)
and a test tiling area (right) for the seamless pattern square in the middle, as shown in <a href="#fig3-4">Figure 3-4</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig3-4"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="04/seamlesspattern.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 3-4: Seamless pattern document template.
Create your pattern (replacing the sample content) in the middle and watch it being tiled on the right.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				In the simplest case (templates without parameters), a  template
is just a regular Inkscape SVG document; when creating a new document,
Inkscape simply makes a copy of such a template. 
You can add your own templates to the list; any document that is a better starting point than the default empty canvas can be
turned into a template. For this, just copy or save the document to the user templates
folder you can open from <span class="ui">Preferences</span>, <span class="ui">System</span> page, by clicking <span class="ui">Open</span> next to <span class="ui">User templates</span>.
You can even override the standard templates if you use the same name for your
custom template; in particular, if you save your <a id="41"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_41" title="41"/>template as default.svg, 
it will be used for all new documents created when you run Inkscape or press Ctrl-N.</p>
			<a id="section3.3"/><h2>3.3 Input Device Setup</h2>
			<p>
				You can't really use a graphic editor such as Inkscape without some kind of pointing device.
What probably <em>won't</em> work is any device where you point with your fingers, such as a touchscreen or a laptop 
touchpad—human fingers are too blunt for precise graphics work. A regular computer mouse works just fine, and 
most people do all kinds of Inkscape work with nothing but a mouse.</p>
			<p>
				However, if you plan to use Inkscape for artistic drawing (<a href="c14.xhtml#ch14">Chapter 14</a>), you may want to 
get a pressure-sensitive graphics tablet such as those made by Wacom, HUION, or XP-Pen. With it, you get
more natural pointing and drawing with a pen and the ability to create variable-width strokes that depend on
pressure—just like the darkness of a regular pen or pencil trace depends on how hard you press it on paper.</p>
			<p>
				Inkscape has a dialog for setting up a pressure-sensitive device (<span class="ui">Edit<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Input Devices</span>).
The first edition of this book recommended, for press sensitivity to work, to switch it to the <span class="ui">Screen</span>
mode for each of the available <span class="ui">Devices</span> in this dialog. With modern Inkscape, however, I find that
I never need to change anything in that dialog at all: a pressure-sensitive tablet just works.</p>
			<a id="section3.4"/><h2>3.4 Keyboard Setup</h2>
			<p>Inkscape is unusually rich in keyboard shortcuts. A complete list of all its keyboard
and mouse shortcuts contains almost seven hundred entries.</p>
			<p><a id="42"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_42" title="42"/>Normally, keyboard shortcuts don't require any setup—they just work. Sometimes,
however, you may want to change some shortcuts or add new ones, perhaps
because you're used to a different keyboard layout from another program, or simply
because your work habits are not adequately covered by the existing shortcuts.</p>
			<p>
				Most (although not all) of Inkscape's keyboard shortcuts can be changed.
You can also assign a shortcut to any of the commands that you see in the
menus, including any extensions in the <span class="ui">Extensions</span> menu (<a href="c19.xhtml#ch19">Chapter 19</a>).</p>
			<p>
				To view or edit Inkscape's keyboard shortcuts, go to the <span class="ui"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> dialog (<a href="#section3.1">3.1</a>), <span class="ui"><strong>Interface<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Keyboard</strong></span> (<a href="#fig3-5">Figure 3-5</a>).
Here, you can redefine shortcuts for any menu command or action as well as (on the <span class="ui">Modifiers</span> tab) the keyboard modifiers for the most common mouse actions 
(canvas panning, selection, movement, and transformation). The shortcuts you cannot (yet) configure include those limited to a single
tool or mode.</p>
			<a id="fig3-5"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="04/keyboardshortcuts.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 3-5: Viewing and editing Inkscape's keyboard shortcuts</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Before you do any manual tweaking, check the list of available shortcut files at the top. 
Inkscape offers  keyboard layout emulations of all of its major 
competitors (Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW, Xara Xtreme, Macromedia Freehand) as well as for
some minor vector editors (Zoner Draw, ACD Systems Canvas). There's also a variant of the standard layout that
places the most often used commands <a id="43"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_43" title="43"/>on the left half of the keyboard so you can avoid lifting your
right hand from the mouse or tablet. It may be that one of these emulations suits you better than Inkscape's default,
so you don't have to edit shortcuts one by one.</p>
			<p>Alternative layouts may not be as complete or up to date as the main one. Developers welcome any help in
improving these alternative layouts or adding new ones.</p>
			<p>
				The shortcuts in the list are grouped by the menus that have the corresponding commands; you can filter for a command you're interested in using the <span class="ui">Search</span> field at the top. To edit or assign a shortcut to a command, click in the middle column; once it changes to <span class="ui">New accelerator...</span> (accelerator being a fancy word for shortcut), just press the key combination you want and it becomes assigned to this command. Inkscape will warn you about any conflicts (shortcuts already assigned to other commands). If you messed up, use the <span class="ui"><strong>Reset</strong></span> button.</p>
				<a id="section3.5"/>
				<h2>3.5 Page Setup</h2>
			<p>
				The first tab of the <span class="ui">Document Properties</span> dialog, called <span class="ui">Page</span>
(see <a href="#fig3-2">Figure 3-2</a>), contains some general settings that you will be changing quite often, so
let's look at them now. (Other tabs control grids, guides, and snapping
modes; I will describe them in <a href="c07.xhtml#ch7">Chapter 7</a>.)</p>
			<a id="section3.5.1"/><h3>3.5.1 Default Unit</h3>
			<p>
				The default unit of measurement for your document—such as<span class="ui">px</span> (SVG pixel; see <a href="b01.xhtml#sectionA.6">A.6</a>) or <span class="ui">mm</span> (millimeters)—will
affect all places where you see or can specify lengths or coordinates. For example, the<span class="ui">X</span>, <span class="ui">Y</span>, <span class="ui">W</span>, and <span class="ui">H</span> controls of the Selector tool display their values measured with the
default unit of the document, although you can change that with unit drop-down to the right of them
(see <a href="c06.xhtml#fig6-10">Figure 6-10</a>). Similarly, status bar hints (for
example, when drawing a path with the Pen tool, <a href="c14.xhtml#section14.1.1">14.1.1</a>) indicate distances in the
default unit.</p>
			<a id="section3.5.2"/><h3>3.5.2 Page Size</h3>
			<p>
				The list of
standard document sizes is pretty self-explanatory; in the same area, you can specify
a custom size and the orientation (portrait or
landscape). Inkscape's canvas is virtually limitless (<a href="c01.xhtml#section1.1">1.1</a>), so you can
draw anywhere on it, be it inside or outside the page; however, most standard SVG
viewers will display only what is on the page, ignoring anything outside the page
boundaries.</p>
			<p>
				Therefore, if you're going to publish or share your artwork in SVG format, you can
use the outside-the-page canvas as a clipboard or work area—but then place the finalized
artwork onto the page. Printing or exporting to most vector formats also ignores
everything outside the page. Bitmap export (<a href="c18.xhtml#section18.6">18.6</a>), however, is more flexible; you can export the page rectangle, or the
actual drawing (all objects), or just the selected objects no matter where they are
located.</p>
			<p><a id="44"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_44" title="44"/>If you've been drawing without much regard to page borders but now want your
drawing to fit precisely within the page boundaries, a convenient way to do this is the<span class="ui">Resize page to drawing or selection</span> button in the <span class="ui">Document Properties</span>
dialog (click <span class="ui"><strong>Resize page to content...</strong></span> to expand that area). Clicking this button makes the page 
border frame the selected objects or (if there's no selection) the entire drawing exactly; you can also
specify any of the four margins.</p>
			<p>As you resize the page, the objects in your drawing remain fixed relative to
the top and left sides, whereas the right and bottom sides move.</p>
			<p>
				At other times, however, you may not care about the size of the page at all. For
example, you may be working on a collection of icons or logos, all in the same SVG file,
not intending to share the SVG but exporting each icon to a separate bitmap file. In
that case, the rectangle of the page is just a distraction. The page border
controls at the bottom right of the <span class="ui">Document Properties</span> dialog allow you to change the color and shadow
of this rectangle or just hide it altogether. You can also place the border on top of
the drawing so it remains visible over any objects that might otherwise
obscure the edges of the page.</p>
			<a id="section3.5.3"/><h3>3.5.3 Background</h3>
			<p>
				You can also change the background color and background opacity of a document (the default is
fully transparent white). Just click the color swatch (lower left) and use the pop-up color
selector menu, as shown in <a href="#fig3-6">Figure 3-6</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig3-6"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="04/docprefs-color.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 3-6: Choosing page background color and
opacity</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Changing the opacity of a white background has no visible effect on your
screen, but it will affect the exported PNG files—they will have a transparent
background only if you have a transparent background in your SVG document.
You can also enable the <span class="ui">Checkerboard background</span> option in <span class="ui">Document Properties</span>
to make it easier to manage transparent objects.</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>
				</div>
				<section class="box">
					<h2>No document background in SVG</h2>
					<p><a id="45"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_45" title="45"/>The background color and opacity will not work in other SVG viewers—they will always show a transparent background.
The Inkscape background color setting is limited to display and bitmap export in Inkscape itself.
Similarly, the checkered background is purely an Inkscape visual preference and not part of the SVG document.
If you want a colored background that will show everywhere, create a colored rectangle underlying the
entire drawing.</p>

			<a id="section3.6"/>
			<h2>3.6 Instances, Documents, and Views</h2>
			<p>
				An Inkscape window you see on your screen (such as the one on <a href="c02.xhtml#fig2-2">Figure 2-2</a>) is not the
same as Inkscape itself. A running copy of the program—an <em>instance</em>—may have
many documents open, each document being in its own editing window. Moreover, you can load the same
document into more than one window to have different views of the same
drawing. Any changes made to a document in one window are immediately reflected in all
windows (within the same instance) where that document is loaded.</p>
			<p>
				If you start with
any existing document's window and use the <span class="ui">File<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Open</span> command (Ctrl-O) from it,
you will open a new window with a different document (but within the same instance).
If, however, you start  from a window with a
new and unchanged document (that is, just an empty canvas), it will be replaced by the
opened document without opening a new window.</p>
			<p>
				Alternatively, you can start Inkscape from the command line listing the filenames of all documents you want to open (<a href="b03.xhtml#sectionC.3">C.3</a>):</p>
			<pre>$ inkscape portrait.svg ../path/to/document.svg another.svg</pre>
			<p>
				If you want to open a new window with another view of a document you
already have open, use the <span class="ui"><strong>View<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Duplicate Window</strong></span> command. After that,
you will have two windows with two views
of the same document, but each with its own
independent zoom level, active tool, and selection. Any changes made to the document in
one window are immediately visible in the other.</p>
			<p>To cycle through all the windows belonging to the same instance of Inkscape (whether they have
the same or different documents), press Ctrl-Tab (forward) or
Shift-Ctrl-Tab (backward).</p>
			<p>
				For example, in one window you can work in close zoom on small details of your
drawing, at the same time viewing the entire document zoomed out in another window, as shown in <a href="#fig3-7">Figure 3-7</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig3-7"/><figure>

			<p>
				The main components of Inkscape's window (<a href="c02.xhtml#fig2-5">Figure 2-5</a>) are, from top to bottom: the menu,
the controls bar (whose contents change when you switch tools), the
main toolbox on the left and the dialog dock on the right with the document canvas
between them, and, at the bottom, the palette and the status bar. By default, the canvas
area has rulers (top and left sides) and scroll bars (bottom and right sides).</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">

				<section class="note">

					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<p>
				Using commands in the <span class="ui">Show/Hide</span> submenu of the<span class="ui">View</span> menu, you can hide all parts of an Inkscape window with the exception of the menu and the canvas
itself, as shown in <a href="#fig3-8">Figure 3-8</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig3-8"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="04/minimal-window.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 3-8: A minimal Inkscape window</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Leave only what you need; the more you hide, the more room is left for your
drawing. I usually hide the commands bar, rulers, and scroll bars. Most of the time I
also hide the palette, unless I plan to use Inkscape for color-intensive tasks (such as
coloring cartoons). All these options are remembered and will be restored when you
next start Inkscape.</p>
			<p>
				To switch Inkscape's window to fullscreen
mode, press F11 or use <span class="ui"><strong>View<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Fullscreen</strong></span>. In that mode, the set of
visible interface elements can be entirely different. For example, you may show the
toolbar and the tool controls in the regular mode, where you do all the editing, but hide
them in the fullscreen mode to view your artwork with minimum
distraction.</p>
			<a id="section3.7.1"/><h3>
				3.7.1 <a id="47"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_47" title="47"/>Window Geometry</h3>
			<p>
				The phrase <em>window geometry</em> refers to something very simple: the size of an Inkscape
window and its position on the screen. Trying to be as helpful as possible,
Inkscape remembers the size and position for each document's window and saves those
values in the document. So when you next load the document, its window will open with
the same size and position it had the last time the document was saved.</p>
			<p>
				In most cases, this is helpful. Sometimes, however, this is more of an annoyance—for example, if you get Inkscape SVG files from someone who has a different screen
resolution, the window on your screen may end up in a weird place. To disable this
behavior, in the <span class="ui"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> dialog select <span class="ui"><strong>Interface<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Windows</strong></span> page and change
the <span class="ui"><strong>Saving window geometry</strong></span> option, shown in <a href="#fig3-9">Figure 3-9</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig3-9"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="04/window-geo.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 3-9: The <span class="ui">Saving window geometry</span> option</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The first choice disables both saving and reading window geometry. The second choice
makes window geometry a global rather than per-document preference, so that whenever
you change the size or position of any Inkscape window, this geometry is then applied to
all subsequently opened windows. The last choice—per-document window geometry—is the
default.</p>
			<p>Apart from window geometry, the current zoom level and the view area are always saved
with the document, so you will be looking at the same place at the same zoom when you
next load it into Inkscape.</p>
			<a id="section3.8"/><h2>
				3.8 <a id="48"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_48" title="48"/>Dialogs</h2>
			<p>
				Inkscape's user interface contains a number of
movable panels, called <em>dialogs</em>, each with a specific function. While Inkscape
strives to make most editing operations accessible right on the
canvas via tools and shortcuts, dialogs still exist and are used quite frequently (<a href="#fig3-10">Figure 3-10</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig3-10"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="04/docked-dialogs.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 3-10: Floating and docked dialogs</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				For each dialog, usually there's a menu command and a keyboard shortcut that begins
with Ctrl and Shift (for example, Shift-Ctrl-F opens
the <span class="ui">Fill and Stroke</span> dialog). A newly opened dialog gets keyboard focus, so you can not
only work with it using your mouse, but also navigate it using the Tab key,
switch tabs with Ctrl-Page Up and Ctrl-Page Down, type values into fields,
and so on.</p>
			<p>To close a dialog, click the "X" in the top-right corner, or if the
dialog has keyboard focus, press Ctrl-W. To move keyboard focus back to the
canvas without closing the dialog, click the canvas or press Escape. 
If a dialog is already opened, choosing its command or invoking the shortcut
again does not close it but transfers keyboard focus to it.</p>
			<p>
				A dockable dialog can be <em>docked</em>—placed into the
docking area on the right-hand side of the editing window—or it can be <em>floating</em> in a
small window of its own. (Nondockable dialogs, such as <span class="ui">Preferences</span>, are always in separate windows.) 
Simply drag any  dialog to or from the dock; two or more dialogs can even be docked together into a 
floating dock of their own. Closed, each dialog remembers its status (docked or floating) and position the next time you open it.</p>
			<p><a id="49"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_49" title="49"/>In <a href="#fig3-10">Figure 3-10</a>, one floating window contains two dialogs, another contains one, and the main
dock in the editing window contains three more dialogs.</p>
			<p>
				If you don't like the dock, go to the <span class="ui"><strong>Windows</strong></span> page of <span class="ui"><strong>Preferences</strong></span>
and change the <span class="ui"><strong>Dialog behavior</strong></span> option from<span class="ui"><strong>Dockable</strong></span> to <span class="ui"><strong>Floating</strong></span>. This will disable the dock and 
make all dialogs open in a floating state.</p>
			<a id="section3.9"/><h2>3.9 Themes and Icons</h2>
			<p>Not everyone is pleased by Inkscape's default appearance—which is not surprising given how sensitive its users tend to be
to aesthetics and how much time they spend in the program. Fortunately, Inkscape itself is pretty flexible in this regard.</p>
			<p>
				On the <span class="ui">Interface<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Themeing</span> page of <span class="ui">Preferences</span>, you can choose from a number of preinstalled <em>themes</em> that
affect how all elements of the Inkscape UI look. Perhaps the most practically useful of these are the <span class="ui">HighContrast</span> (better contrast of labels for legibility)
and <span class="ui">HighContrastInverse</span> (same but white-on-black instead of black-on-white) themes (<a href="#fig3-11">Figure 3-11</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig3-11"/><figure>

					<p>
						Figure 3-11: Inkscape using the <span class="ui">HighContrastInverse</span> theme with multicolor icons</p>

			</figure>
			<p>On the same page, you can select one of the alternative icon sets, as well as control the size of the icons in various toolbars. Unfortunately, there's
no way to similarly change the font size of the UI labels. You can add new themes and icon sets to the program; search the internet to see
if there are any you would like to try.</p>

				3.10 <a id="50"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_50" title="50"/>Basic Zooming</h2>
			<p><em>Zooming</em> (in or out) temporarily magnifies your view on a drawing so you
can examine the small details (when zoomed in) or look at the whole picture (when zoomed
out). Zooming does not change the drawing itself, only your view of it.</p>
			<p>
				The (almost) infinite scalability of vector graphics makes zooming one of the most
common operations in vector work. It's not surprising that Inkscape offers <em>a lot</em>
of different ways to zoom.</p>
			<p>
				First of all, the current zoom level is always displayed in the <span class="ui">Z:</span> editable field on the right end of the status bar (below the canvas), as shown in <a href="#fig3-12">Figure 3-12</a>. You can always click it, type
the desired level of zoom, and press Enter.</p>
			<a id="fig3-12"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="04/zoom-spinbutton.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 3-12: Zoom indicator in the status bar</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The simplest way to zoom in or out using the keyboard is by pressing the plus sign and minus sign keys (+ and
–), correspondingly. The keys on the keypad (on the rightmost end of the
keyboard on most desktop computers) work just as well as those on the main keyboard
(above the letter keys). What's more, the equal sign (=), usually located on the same
physical key as the plus sign, also works for zooming in, and the underscore (_), usually on
the same key as the minus sign, works for zooming out; in other words, you never have to press
Shift to access the zooming keys.</p>
			<p>Zooming with the plus and minus keys works in all tools and modes, except when you are editing text.  In
text, the plus and minus keys on the main keyboard insert the corresponding characters,
but the keypad + and – keys still work for zooming.</p>
			<p>Often your hand is on your mouse or tablet pen, so reaching for the keyboard
is inconvenient. The simplest way to zoom in by mouse is with the middle button
(on most mice, this is not actually a button but a scroll wheel that you can click as well as rotate).
The point you click will keep its relative position
in the window after the zoom, so by clicking on some small object, you zoom into that
object—unlike the plus/minus keys that zoom in/out of the center of the visible area. To zoom out,
middle-click with the Shift key pressed.</p>
			<p>
				Additionally, with a scroll wheel mouse, you can rotate the wheel up to zoom in or
down to zoom out. By default, you need to press Ctrl for that, because the scroll wheel
without modifiers scrolls the document, as in most other programs. There's an option,
however, to make it zoom without modifiers and scroll with Ctrl; you can set it in the <span class="ui">Scrolling</span> page of the <span class="ui">Preferences</span> dialog.</p>
			<p>
				You can adjust the amount of zooming in or out that the plus/minus keys, the 
middle click, and the single scroll wheel click perform. This value is set in the <span class="ui">Behavior<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Steps</span> page of the<span class="ui">Preferences</span> dialog. The default is 141 percent, which is 100 multiplied by the
square root of two, so that two subsequent zoom-in keystrokes zoom you in exactly
200 percent.</p>
			<a id="section3.11"/><h2>
				3.11 <a id="51"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_51" title="51"/>The Zoom Tool</h2>
			<p>
				More zooming methods are available in the Zoom tool (the one with the magnifying glass in the
toolbar on the left). In my work, I actually never switch to this tool, because
all of its commands and modes are also available in <em>any</em> tool via various
shortcuts. Still, let's look at the Zoom tool for an overview of Inkscape's zooming capabilities.</p>
			<p>
				As you would expect, simple mouse-clicking in the Zoom tool zooms in, and Shift-click zooms
out. Sometimes, however, you already know the area that you want to zoom into, and you
don't want to go through all the intermediate zoom levels to reach your target zoom. In
that case, simply drag with the tool to create a rectangular rubber band around that area—Inkscape
will zoom directly into the area when you release the mouse, as <a href="#fig3-13">Figure 3-13</a> demonstrates.</p>
			<a id="fig3-13"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="04/zoom-area.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 3-13: Zooming into an area with the Zoom
tool</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>You can also use the zoom-into-an-area trick 
without switching to the Zoom tool. In any tool or mode, dragging the middle mouse
button with Shift starts the same zoom area rubber band and zooms into it when
you release the button.</p>
			<p>
				Let's look at the controls bar of the Zoom tool, shown in <a href="#fig3-14">Figure 3-14</a>.</p>
				<a id="fig3-14"/>
				<figure>
				<img alt="" src="04/zoom-tool.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 3-14: Command buttons on the Zoom tool controls
bar</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The first two buttons do the same as the plus/minus keys. Next are the three predefined
zoom buttons: 100 percent (also via the 1 key), 200 percent (the 2 key), and 50 percent. Then, there
is the very useful <span class="ui">Zoom to fit selection</span> button (also via the 3 key); it zooms in or
out and scrolls the view so that your current selection entirely fits into the
window. The next three buttons do the same for the entire drawing (the 4 key), the page
(the 5 key), and the page width (the 6 key). You can also zoom to selection
temporarily by pressing and holding the Q key; releasing it will return you to previous zoom (if
there's no selection, Q temporarily zooms to the page).</p>
			<p>
				Perhaps the most interesting are the last two buttons on the Zoom controls bar. As
mentioned above, zooming does not change the document—so you can't undo it with the<span class="ui">Undo</span> command. However, there's another way to "undo zooming."</p>
			<p><a id="52"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_52" title="52"/>Every time you change your zoom level, Inkscape remembers the previous zoom and the
area of the canvas you were looking at. The <span class="ui">Previous Zoom</span> and <span class="ui">Next
Zoom</span> buttons on the Zoom controls bar allow you to travel
back and forth in this history of zooms. For example, if after viewing the entire
drawing you zoomed into a small area, edited something, and then want to see the entire
drawing again, you don't need to press the minus sign key repeatedly.
Instead, just press the backquote key (`) and you'll be taken to your previous
zoom and view instantly. The same ` key with
Shift will then re-zoom you back into the same small area.
The zoom history is unlimited—it stores all your zooms from the beginning of your editing session.</p>
			<p>
				Along with the Zoom toolbar and the keyboard shortcuts, all the same commands are also
available in the <span class="ui">Zoom</span> submenu of the <span class="ui">View</span> menu.</p>
			<a id="section3.12"/><h2>3.12 Panning</h2>
			<p>
				When you <em>pan</em> a document in Inkscape, you shift the visible area
inside the window without changing the zoom. It's basically the same as <em>scrolling</em>,
except that scrolling assumes a single axis (such as up and down), whereas panning can
go in any direction. After zooming, panning is the most common action when working in a vector editor.</p>
			<p>An Inkscape document window has the traditional scroll bars that
will scroll both horizontally and vertically to reach any point on the
canvas. Scroll bars, however, are pretty clumsy, so I usually prefer other methods for
panning and turn the scroll bars off (Ctrl-B) to free up some extra room for the
artwork.</p>
			<p>
				You can pan using the keyboard as well as the mouse. With the keyboard, press
Ctrl with the arrow keys to scroll in any of the four
directions. This is handier than it sounds, because if you press and hold
Ctrl and an arrow key, the canvas movement <em>accelerates</em>. This means you can budge the
canvas position a little with a single keystroke or swoosh it quickly
aside if you press and hold. The speed of keyboard scrolling (the distance for a single keystroke)
as well as the acceleration coefficient are set in the <span class="ui">Behavior<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Scrolling</span> page of the <span class="ui">Preferences</span> dialog.</p>
			<p>With the mouse, the easiest way to pan the canvas is by dragging it around with the
middle button. Again, this works in any tool or mode. There's no dedicated "hand" tool
for panning in Inkscape. You can also scroll vertically with the scroll wheel on your
mouse and horizontally with Shift-wheel.</p>
			<p>Inkscape tries to make panning automatic whenever possible. For example, when you
drag selected objects with the Selector tool and push them against the edge of the screen,
the canvas will automatically scroll to give way. Also, when you select a new object or
path node with the Tab key, Inkscape scrolls to make this object or node
visible.</p>

					<h2>Canvas panning in AI vs. Inkscape</h2>
					<p><a id="53"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_53" title="53"/>Canvas panning is one of the areas where Inkscape's user interface is
noticeably different from that of its biggest competitor, Adobe Illustrator. Many
Illustrator users are used to panning by pressing the spacebar and dragging with the
left mouse button. In Inkscape, however, pressing the spacebar in any tool
temporarily switches you to the Selector tool; hitting the spacebar again switches back to
the tool you were using before. Specially for Illustrator refugees, 
Inkscape offers a compatibility option: with the spacebar pressed, simply moving the mouse (no need to click anything) will drag
the canvas. Enabled by default, this option can be disabled in the <span class="ui">Behavior<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Scrolling</span> page of the <span class="ui">Preferences</span> dialog.</p>

			<h2>3.13 Canvas Orientation</h2>
			<p>If you've ever watched professional artists (drawers, cartoonists, illustrators) at work, you may have noticed how freely they handle their media.
They slant, rotate, even overturn their drawings all the time for better view of their work as well as for a more natural pen swipe. You can easily do
this in Inkscape, too.</p>
			<p>
				Simply use your mouse wheel with Ctrl-Shift pressed to rotate the canvas around the cursor point, 
15 degrees per notch (to change this value, go to <span class="ui"><strong>Behavior<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Steps</strong></span> in <span class="ui"><strong>Preferences</strong></span>). For more precise control,
use the <span class="ui"><strong>R:</strong></span> numeric widget at the right end of the status bar, as shown in <a href="#fig3-15">Figure 3-15</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig3-15"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="04/rotate-spinbutton.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 3-15: Rotate indicator in the status bar</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				In <span class="ui">View<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Canvas Orientation</span>,
you can also flip (mirror) the canvas horizontally or vertically; to remove any rotations (but not flips) and return to the default view, use <span class="ui"><strong>Reset Rotation</strong></span>
from the same submenu. Rotation does not affect the SVG code of the document and is not saved at all; it is purely for workspace convenience.</p>
			<a id="section3.14"/><h2>3.14 Rendering Modes</h2>
			<p>
				By default, Inkscape strives to render each document as closely as possible to how it
should be rendered per the SVG standard. However, sometimes you need to<em>work</em> with the document, not just look at it, and such complete rendering may 
become an obstacle. This is when you switch to the <em>Outline</em> view mode (<span class="ui">View<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span> Display Mode<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Outline</span> from the menu). In Outline mode, there are
no fills, no transparency, no color, no gradients, no blurring or any other
filters. Any object is shown as a thin outline whose width (1 screen pixel) does not
depend on zoom, as shown in <a href="#fig3-16">Figure 3-16</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig3-16"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="04/outline-mode.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 3-16: A few objects in the Normal view mode (left)
and the Outline view mode (right)</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="54"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_54" title="54"/>The obvious reason to switch to Outline mode is to make working with complex
slow-rendering documents faster. Also, in Outline mode it's much easier to find
and access invisible objects (those that are completely transparent or hidden
underneath other objects). In this mode, everything is visible, and you can select any
object by clicking its outline.</p>
			<p>
				Different colors of outlines in the Outline mode are used to differentiate object
types. Regular paths and shapes use black outlines, bitmap objects (<a href="c18.xhtml#ch18">Chapter 18</a>) are shown as
red-outline rectangles with two diagonals, clipping paths (<a href="c18.xhtml#section18.3">18.3</a>) are green, and masks (<a href="c18.xhtml#section18.3">18.3</a>) are blue. Text objects are the only kind of objects that are not outlined; instead, they are
shown with black fill. You can also force bitmap images to render even in Outline mode; the corresponding
option is on the <span class="ui">Imported Images</span> page of the <span class="ui">Preferences</span> dialog.</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>
				</div>
				<section class="note">
					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>
						You can force Inkscape to start
in Outline mode. For that, edit your preferences.xml file (see <a href="#section3.1">3.1</a>)
by finding the element with <code>id="startmode"</code> and changing its<code>outline</code> attribute to <code>1</code>.</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<p>
				The Outline mode is so useful that Inkscape offers two more ways to use it. Instead of switching the entire document into Outline,
you can enable the <em>X-Ray</em> mode by choosing <span class="ui">View<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Split Mode<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>X-Ray</span> from the menu or pressing Alt-6.
In this mode, only a circular area around the mouse cursor is rendered in Outline while the rest of
the document is shown as usual (<a href="#fig3-17">Figure 3-17</a>). This way you can examine the structure of a complex drawing piece by piece without losing
the context of the finished work. Or you can enable the <em>Split View</em> mode (<span class="ui">View<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Split Mode<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Split</span> or Ctrl-6) where the drawing is split into two halves, with a draggable 
vertical divider, showing normal rendering on the left and outline on the right.</p>
			<a id="fig3-17"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="04/xray.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 3-17: X-Ray mode: looking inside a complex illustration</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="55"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_55" title="55"/> The <em>Outline Overlay</em> display mode (<span class="ui">View<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Display Mode<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Outline Overlay</span>) is the same as Outline mode, but it adds a faded-out nonclickable rendering of the document in the background. You can still use the outlines to select objects, but this mode provides a better idea of what those outlines correspond to in the normal view.</p>
			<p>
				Yet another way to speed up rendering is the <em>No Filters</em> mode accessible via <span class="ui">View<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Display Mode<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>No Filters</span>. By far the slowest-rendering element in most drawing
is the filters, such as blur (<a href="c17.xhtml#ch17">Chapter 17</a>). By disabling them, this mode may speed up rendering considerably without
the drawing becoming unrecognizable. Another rendering mode, <em>Visible Hairlines</em> (<span class="ui">View<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Display Mode<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Visible Hairlines</span>), differs from normal rendering only
in that it never allows strokes (<a href="c02.xhtml#section2.8">2.8</a>) to become invisibly thin, no matter how far you zoom out; this may be useful
in technical drawings.</p>
			<p>Use Ctrl-5 to switch between all the rendering modes (Normal, No Filters, Outline, Visible Hairlines, Outline Overlay) cyclically.</p>
			<a id="section3.14.1"/>
			<h3>3.14.1 Color Rendering</h3>
			<p>
				Just in case you need it, there's a way to render a document in grayscale; use <span class="ui"><strong>View<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Color Display Mode</strong></span> from the
menu or Alt-5 to toggle.</p>
			<p>
				Also, Inkscape can perform onscreen emulation of the colors of some output device, typically a printer. This is called <span class="ui">Color-Managed View</span>
(from the <span class="ui">View</span> menu). The details of this mode are set up on the <span class="ui">Input/Output<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Color management</span> page of the<span class="ui">Preferences</span> dialog (section <span class="ui">Proofing</span>).  Basically, what you need is an <em>ICC profile</em> of the device you want to emulate, which
you can then direct Inkscape to use; for details, see <a href="c18.xhtml#section18.8">18.8</a>.</p>

<p class="startpara">HERE YOU CAN FIND A FULLY ANNOTATED DIAGRAM OF THE GPIO PINS ON YOUR RASPBERRY PI. EACH PIN IS LABELED WITH ITS PHYSICAL NUMBER AND BCM NUMBER.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_201"/>The physical numbers simply correspond to the pin’s actual physical location, starting at 1 and going all the way down to 40. The BCM number on each pin (for example, BCM 25) is known as the <em>Broadcom</em> pin number, or the <em>GPIO</em> number. These numbers are used internally by your Pi’s processor, and you usually need to use them inside GPIO Zero and other programming libraries.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Some pins have alternate functions specified in brackets; if you want to learn more about these, see the official documentation on the Raspberry Pi website (<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/"><em>https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio</em><em>/</em></a>).</p>&#13;

    community building efforts you can promote at your school to encourage a safe,
    supportive, and engaging learning environment. Research indicates that students
    who feel connected to their school community are more likely to exhibit altruistic
    behaviors, be more academically driven, and develop improved social-emotional
    skills. The activities and programs covered here are intended to foster a sense
    of belonging and accomplishment for your students. They’ll also involve constructing
    a support system that will hopefully extend beyond the school walls and into the
    local community.

    computer science educator, you know the power of large networks. *Metcalfe’s*
    *law* states that the number of possible unique connections in a network grows
    proportional to the square of the number of users connected to it. The maximum
    number of unique connections, is equal to *n*(*n*-1)/2, where *n* is the number
    of nodes on the network. Similarly, the more people in a group, the more ways
    the people in that group can form relationships and collaborate. A classroom of
    20 students can form 190 possible relationship connections, and a computer science
    program of 100 students can form 4,950\. But you, as the educator, must provide
    the environment in which these relationships can grow.

    voice and choice. Classroom coding exercises are one such area. In Chapter 7,
    we walked through several coding exercises and examined how to address multiple
    computer science standards in each one. As an educator, over the years, you’ll

    connections is a *buddy program*. Traditionally, this is where an older student
    is paired with a younger student of at least two grade levels’ difference. The
    younger student benefits from the mentoring and one-on-one time spent with the

- en: The relationship and benefits of this technique can depend on the skill levels
    of the two programmers. If one programmer has more experience, they’ll take a
    mentoring role to the less experienced member. It’s very important in such a pairing
    that the more experienced programmer not drive the development, putting the less
    experienced programmer into a more passive role. If the two programmers are equally
    proficient, they’ll both benefit from the differing backgrounds and experience
    they bring to the exercise. In all pairings, the programmers will benefit from
    increased productivity because they must remain focused out of respect for their
    peer, and increased quality because two sets of eyes review every line of code
    committed during the exercise. Students will also practice their technical communication
    and collaboration skills when using this technique.

    specifically. One study found that girls who took part in pair programming exercises
    in a computer science class performed significantly better on the final exam.
    Another study found that the practice helped to close the gender gap and encourage

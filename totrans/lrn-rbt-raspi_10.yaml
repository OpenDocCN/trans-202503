    PI. EACH PIN IS LABELED WITH ITS PHYSICAL NUMBER AND BCM NUMBER.

- en: The physical numbers simply correspond to the pin’s actual physical location,
    starting at 1 and going all the way down to 40\. The BCM number on each pin (for
    example, BCM 25) is known as the *Broadcom* pin number, or the *GPIO* number.
    These numbers are used internally by your Pi’s processor, and you usually need
    to use them inside GPIO Zero and other programming libraries.

    more about these, see the official documentation on the Raspberry Pi website ([*https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio**/*](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/)).

			</header>
			<p class="ChapterIntro"><a id="57"/>Objects are the bread and butter of Inkscape
graphics. Much of the rest of this book is
devoted to various types of objects, their properties, and techniques for working with them. However,
regardless of type, all Inkscape objects have a lot of things
in common.</p>
			<p>This and the next two chapters cover the fundamentals of objects
and generic object operations in painstaking detail.</p>
			<a id="section4.1"/><h2>4.1 Object Properties</h2>
			<p>An object is just a thing somewhere on the canvas—a part of your
drawing. Of course, it's not always that simple; what looks like a separate
object may be either a part of some other object or a combination of several objects.
Identifying individual objects takes experience and effort.</p>
			<p>
				Inkscape has a number of dialogs for manipulating properties of objects, but
only one of them is generic enough to be called simply <span class="ui">Object Properties</span>
(accessible by pressing Shift-Ctrl-O, from the right-click menu on the object, or from the <span class="ui">Object</span> menu).
Select (<a href="c05.xhtml#ch5">Chapter 5</a>) a single object to view its properties, as shown in <a href="#fig4-1">Figure 4-1</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig4-1"/><figure>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="58"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_58" title="58"/>The <em>identifier</em> (<span class="ui">ID</span> field) of an object is the <code>id</code> attribute of the
corresponding element in the SVG source of the document (<a href="b01.xhtml#chA">Appendix A</a>). Its value is always unique
within the document; Inkscape provides unique IDs for all objects
automatically, but you can change this value so long as it remains unique.</p>
			<p>
				Assigning meaningful names to objects is a useful approach to organizing complex
artwork. The ID is not the best way to do this, however; per XML
rules, you can use only a very limited set of characters in element IDs—no spaces, only
Latin letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, and dots. For a more human-friendly
alternative, use the object's <span class="ui">Label</span> (it
corresponds to the <code>inkscape:label</code> extension attribute in SVG). It can be of any length, use
any characters whatsoever, and need not be unique.</p>

					<h2>Title, Description, Interactivity attributes</h2>
					<p>
						The <span class="ui">Title</span> and <span class="ui">Description</span> fields may contain additional freeform
metadata about the object (these are the standard <code>title</code> and<code>desc</code> elements of SVG). Since these values are stored in elements, not
attributes, they can even contain child elements such as text markup (even though you cannot
do this via the <span class="ui">Object Properties</span> dialog).</p>
					<p>
						Other fields of the dialog correspond to SVG attributes that mostly make sense outside of Inkscape. 
The <span class="ui">Interactivity</span> section (click to unfold it) allows you to edit the interactivity attributes
(<code>onclick</code>, <code>onmouseover</code>, and so on) that are used in SVG
with embedded scripts (usually in JavaScript). Inkscape does not run the scripts, but this can be useful if you
want to view your SVG in a JavaScript-enabled viewer.</p>

			</aside>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Hide</span> and <span class="ui">Lock</span> checkboxes control the locked and
hidden status of the selected object. A <em>locked</em> object is visible, but most
selection methods cannot select it, so it cannot be changed. A <em>hidden</em>
object is both invisible <em>and</em> unselectable.</p>
			<p>
				I do not recommend hiding or locking individual objects.
You may find yourself in a trap where you need to select an
object to unlock or unhide it—but <a id="59"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_59" title="59"/>you cannot because it is hidden or
locked. Specifically for such situations, the <span class="ui">Object</span> menu contains two
commands, <span class="ui">Unhide All</span> and <span class="ui">Unlock All</span>, that will reveal
and make selectable all objects in the current layer.</p>
			<p>
				It's much more convenient to act on the layer containing the objects you want to hide
or lock. Hiding and locking via layers is not only faster  (affects
multiple objects at a time), it's also easier—even if it's locked or hidden, you can always
access any layer (via the <span class="ui">Layers</span> dialog, see <a href="#section4.9.4">4.9.4</a>) to change its status.</p>
			<a id="section4.2"/><h2>4.2 Coordinates and Units</h2>
			<p>Whenever an object is visible on the canvas, you can measure its position and
size in the familiar rectangular coordinate system with a horizontal X axis and
a vertical Y axis.</p>
			<p>
				In Inkscape, the coordinate origin is always in one of the corners of the page
frame (<a href="c02.xhtml#section2.3">2.3</a>). Older versions of Inkscape placed the coordinate origin in the
bottom left corner of the page, with Y values increasing upward. 
However, the SVG standard places the origin in the top-left corner, with Y values
increasing downward (X values always increase to the right), and more recently Inkscape made this the default in its UI as well.
You can still switch it to the old (and frankly more natural) bottom-left origin on the <span class="ui">Interface</span> page
of <span class="ui">Preferences</span> (<a href="c03.xhtml#section3.1">3.1</a>);
just remember that this affects only the UI—when editing your document's SVG code (for example, in Inkscape's XML Editor,<a href="#section4.10">4.10</a>), all coordinates assume the origin in the top-left corner.</p>
			<p>
				The rulers at the edge of your canvas area are one way to measure the coordinates
(press Ctrl-R to reveal them if they are hidden). As you move your mouse over the
canvas, small triangular markers on the rulers reflect its current position. Also, the
X and Y coordinates of the mouse pointer are always displayed on the
right end of the status bar, just before the zoom field marked <span class="ui">Z</span> (<a href="#fig4-2">Figure 4-2</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig4-2"/><figure>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="60"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_60" title="60"/>The measurement unit used by the rulers is the same as the document unit
that you can set in the <span class="ui">Document Properties</span> dialog (<a href="c03.xhtml#section3.5">3.5</a>). To check,
hover your mouse cursor over a ruler until a floating tool tip appears.</p>

					<h2>The Great DPI Change</h2>
					<p>
						There's one related issue that you may run into even if you don't care about units at all. In version 0.92, Inkscape changed the conversion factor between the SVG pixel unit (<code>px</code>) and inch (<code>in</code>). This factor has a name of its own: DPI (for Dots Per Inch). To match the changing SVG standard, Inkscape switched from the DPI value of 90 to 96. Whenever you open a file created in an older version of Inkscape, it pops up a dialog offering to "fix" this file by scaling all contents so that the sizes in inches (or any other physical units, such as centimeters, which are interlocked with inches) stay the same. If you don't care about physical units, simply choose the first option in that dialog to leave your document unchanged; otherwise,  read the detailed explanation at <a href="https://inkscape.org/learn/faq/#dpi_change">https://inkscape.org/learn/faq/#dpi_change</a>.</p>

			<h2>4.3 Bounding Box</h2>
			<p>
				Let's create an object—for example, draw an ellipse with the Ellipse tool. You
will see that the object, initially selected, is framed by a dashed rectangle (<a href="#fig4-3">Figure 4-3</a>). This
rectangle is the visual representation of what is called the <em>bounding box</em> of the
object—the smallest possible rectangle that completely encloses the object. The
bounding box is always upright—that is, its sides are parallel to the coordinate axes;
if you rotate an object, its bounding box may or may not change its size, but it won't
rotate with the object. (Switch to Selector and rotate the ellipse by pressing the square bracket keys, [ and
].)</p>
			<a id="fig4-3"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="05/bbox.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 4-3: The bounding box of an object is always upright.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The coordinates and dimensions (width, height) of the selected object's bounding box are
shown by the four editable fields in the controls bar of the Selector
tool. The <span class="ui">X</span> and <span class="ui">Y</span> give the coordinates of the top-left corner of
the box (or bottom-left, depending on the coordinate origin preference, <a href="#section4.2">4.2</a>);
the <span class="ui">W</span> <a id="61"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_61" title="61"/>and <span class="ui">H</span> give the width and
height of the bounding box.  If multiple objects are selected, the values reflect the bounding
box of the entire selection. You can change the unit of measurement of
these fields in the drop-down
menu on the right; initially, it's set to the document unit (<a href="c03.xhtml#section3.5.1">3.5.1</a>).</p>
			<p>
				Of course, you can click inside any of these fields and type a new value, which will
make the selected object(s) move (for <span class="ui">X</span> and <span class="ui">Y</span>) or scale (for <span class="ui">W</span> and <span class="ui">H</span>). If you want the
change in width to cause a proportional change in height or vice versa (preserving the aspect ratio), click the lock
button between <span class="ui">W</span> and <span class="ui">H</span> to lock them together.</p>
			<p>
				In Inkscape, bounding boxes of objects can be either<em>visual</em> (this is the default) or <em>geometric</em>.
To switch from one type to the other, go to the <span class="ui"><strong>Tools</strong></span> page of the <span class="ui"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> dialog.
The visual bounding box includes <em>everything that's visible</em> about the object—most notably
its entire stroke (<a href="c09.xhtml#section9.1">9.1</a>) but also markers (<a href="c09.xhtml#section9.5">9.5</a>) and filter margins
(<a href="c17.xhtml#section17.5.4">17.5.4</a>). The geometric box enframes only the <em>geometric outline</em> of the
object's path.</p>
			<p>
				The geometric bounding box closely corresponds to the object as it is
appears in the Outline mode (<a href="c03.xhtml#section3.14">3.14</a>); for example, the outer fringe of a stroked object falls<em>outside</em> of the geometric bounding box. Usually, the geometric bounding box is preferred by
those who use Inkscape for technical drawing, while the visual option makes more sense
for almost everyone else. <a href="#fig4-3">Figure 4-3</a> shows the visual bounding
box: note how  it fully encloses the black stroke of the ellipses.</p>
			<a id="section4.4"/><h2>4.4 Z-Order</h2>
			<p><em>Z-order</em> refers to the order in which objects are drawn on top of each
other. An object on top in the z-order may obscure those below it, if they overlap and if
the top object is not transparent. The term <em>z-order</em> implies a
third coordinate axis, Z, imagined to extend perpendicular to the X/Y plane of
the drawing toward the viewer. Objects higher in the z-order are thus "closer" to the
viewer.</p>
			<p>
				A new object you create is always placed at the very top of the z-order of the current
layer (and if you didn't create any other layers, this will be the top of the z-order of
the entire document). For example, if you draw several ellipses, each new one will be
drawn on top of the previous ones, as shown in <a href="#fig4-4">Figure 4-4</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig4-4"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="05/z-order.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 4-4: Z-order</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Selecting, transforming, or style-changing operations never change the z-order of
objects. This means you can move, scale, or paint an object while it remains upon its
own "floor"—provided you've managed to select that object. <a id="62"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_62" title="62"/>(In <a href="c05.xhtml#section5.9">5.9</a>, you'll
learn methods for selecting objects that are at the bottom of the z-order and cannot be
simply clicked to select.)</p>
			<p>
				Quite often, however, you need to rearrange the stack of objects in your
drawing. Inkscape has four basic commands for moving objects up or down in the z-order: two
absolute ones and two relative ones. They are used quite often, so you can access them as
buttons on the Selector controls bar, via the <span class="ui">Object</span> menu, or via simple keyboard
shortcuts.</p>
			<p>The absolute commands are:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><span class="ui">Raise to Top</span> (Home)
				</dt>
				<dd>Raises selected objects to the very top
of the objects' layer.</dd>
				<dt><span class="ui">Lower to Bottom</span> (End)
				</dt>
				<dd>Lowers selected objects to the very
bottom of the objects' layer.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>The relative commands are:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><span class="ui">Raise</span> (Page Up)
				</dt>
				<dd>Raises selected objects up one step (past one
other object).</dd>
				<dt><span class="ui">Lower</span> (Page Down)
				</dt>
				<dd>Lowers selected objects down one step (past one
other object).</dd>
			</dl>
			<p><a href="#fig4-5">Figure 4-5</a> shows an example of how these commands work on the selected ellipse that is
in the middle of a stack of rectangles.</p>
			<a id="fig4-5"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="05/z-order-change.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 4-5: Changing the z-order</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Note that the relative z-order commands take into account only those objects that<em>overlap</em> the selection (more precisely, those objects whose bounding boxes
overlap the bounding box of the selection). If your selected object or objects do
not overlap any others, the <span class="ui">Raise</span> and <span class="ui">Lower</span> commands will just move the selection all
the way to the top or bottom of the layer, correspondingly.</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">

				<section class="box">
					<h2>Document Order vs. Z-Order</h2>
					<p>
						In the SVG code of the document, objects that are <em>higher</em> in the z-order
are those that are closer to the <em>end</em> of the document. Thus, new objects
are normally appended to the end of the list of existing elements.</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<p><a id="63"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_63" title="63"/>Another thing to remember is that all z-order commands work only <em>within
the layer</em>. If you have several layers in your document, these layers form their own
z-order, and an object in a lower layer can never be on top of an object in a layer
above. For rearranging the z-order of layers, use the layer commands described in <a href="#section4.9.2">4.9.2</a>.</p>
			<p>
				It is possible to have objects in different layers or groups selected at the same time. In this
case, the z-order commands work on each  selected object within <em>its own</em> layer or
group. For example, it may be that a <span class="ui">Raise to Top</span> command will change the
z-order of one selected object but will leave the other untouched if it was already the
topmost object in its layer.</p>
			<p>
				If you need to change the z-order for a lot of objects, try the <span class="ui">Extensions<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Arrange<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Restack</span> extension. It can rearrange any number of selected objects
based on their position or current z-order, as shown in <a href="#fig4-6">Figure 4-6</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig4-6"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="05/restack-window.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 4-6: Managing z-order with the <span class="ui">Restack</span> extension</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				For example, you can sort objects into a z-order stepladder that
goes left to right—so that, of any two selected objects, the one further to the right will be
placed higher in the z-order (<a href="#fig4-7">Figure 4-7</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig4-7"/><figure>

						Figure 4-7: Restacking in action; the original scattering of disks (left) was made with the Spray tool (<a href="#section4.7">4.7</a>).</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="64"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_64" title="64"/>The extension command's dialog lets you select the direction of the stepladder
(four cardinal directions, radial inward or outward from the center of selection, or even at a custom angle)
as well as indicate the reference point—the point of each selected object that it will use
when comparing positions (it can be any of the corners, side mid-points, or the center).
Finally, you can reverse the current z-order of selected objects or randomize it.</p>
			<a id="section4.5"/><h2>4.5 Copying, Cutting, Pasting</h2>
			<p>
				Inkscape supports the traditional <em>clipboard operations</em>: copying, cutting, and
pasting.</p>
			<p><em>Copying</em> (Ctrl-C) remembers a copy of the selected object or
objects in the program's clipboard; <em>cutting</em> (Ctrl-X) does the same as
copying but the object is then deleted. Finally, <em>pasting</em> (Ctrl-V)
places the content of the clipboard back into the document (but retains it in the
clipboard as well, so you can paste the same object multiple times).</p>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Paste</span> command has two variants. The regular <span class="ui">Paste</span>
(Ctrl-V) places the object at the point on the canvas where your mouse cursor
currently is. This is handy for moving an object to an entirely
different place in the document; just cut it from where it was, scroll and/or zoom to
where you want it to be, hover your mouse over the desired location, and press
Ctrl-V. You can even "paint" with copies of an object by moving your mouse
around and pressing Ctrl-V repeatedly.</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>
				</div>
				<section class="note">
					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>
						Another command that places an object under your mouse cursor is<span class="ui">Import</span> <span class="rm">(Ctrl-I);</span> see <a href="c18.xhtml#section18.1">18.1</a>.</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<p>
				Sometimes, however, you want to paste an object exactly where it was copied
from. That's what the <span class="ui">Paste in Place</span> (Ctrl-Alt-V) command does. For
example, you can use it for moving an object from one layer to another
without changing its position on the canvas: copy it, switch to the target layer, and paste in place.</p>
			<p>
				With nothing selected, a pasted object is always placed on top of the current layer in z-order.
However, if you have anything selected during paste, the newly pasted object gets placed just above the topmost selected object in z-order.
You can disable this behavior in <span class="ui">Preferences<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Behavior<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Selecting: Paste on top of selection instead of layer-top</span>.</p>
			<a id="section4.6"/><h2>4.6 Duplicating and Stamping</h2>
			<p>
				Sometimes, people use <span class="ui">Copy</span> and <span class="ui">Paste</span>  as a method to
get a duplicate of one or several objects. In Inkscape, you don't need that
workaround; there's a convenient <span class="ui">Duplicate</span> command (Ctrl-D)
that creates a copy of your selection and places it in the same position on the canvas.
This is equivalent to copying and then pasting in place, except that <span class="ui">Duplicate</span>
does not change the contents of your clipboard.</p>
			<p>All pasting and duplication commands, just as  any other methods of creating new objects,
place the new object on top of the z-order in the current layer.</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>
				</div>
				<section class="note">
					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>
						What if you have selected an object somewhere in the middle of the z-order and
want to duplicate it but keep the copy at the same level instead of jumping to
the top? This may be a symptom of your document not having enough layers. By
placing such an object <a id="65"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_65" title="65"/>into its own layer, you will ensure that duplicating it will
place the copy on top of that object's layer instead of on top of the document.</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<p>
				Yet another method for creating copies of objects is <em>stamping</em>. Whenever you
transform a selection (move, scale, rotate, or skew) by dragging the mouse in the Selector
tool (see <a href="c02.xhtml#section2.7">2.7</a>), you can press spacebar to leave behind a copy of the selection
without interrupting the interactive transformation. For example, if you grab and drag
an ellipse and then press and hold the spacebar while dragging, the object being
moved will leave a trail of its copies on the canvas. Stamping also works in the Node tool
when you drag a selection of nodes (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.5.7">12.5.7</a>).</p>
			<p>
				All object copying methods discussed so far created new independent objects that are
not linked in any way to their originals. If you want a <em>linked copy</em> that inherits some
properties of the original and updates itself automatically, read about clones in<a href="c16.xhtml#ch16">Chapter 16</a>.</p>
			<a id="section4.7"/><h2>
				4.7 Spray Tool <span class="NoteHead">[1.1]</span></h2>
			<p>
				As if all that (copy/pasting, duplicating, stamping) were not enough, Inkscape has an entire tool dedicated
to flooding your canvas with objects: the Spray tool (<a href="#fig4-8">Figure 4-8</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig4-8"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="05/spray-tool.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 4-8: The Spray tool will airbrush your drawing with objects.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="66"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_66" title="66"/>Its basic operation is simple: select one or more
existing objects and drag on canvas to spray around their copies. This upends the traditional  vector editing paradigm
where you tend to work with individual objects; the Spray tool, as well as the Tweak tool (<a href="c06.xhtml#section6.10">6.10</a>) with which it is often teamed up, allow
you to think in terms of <em>masses</em> of objects—clouds of particles, forests of trees, galaxies of stars, schools of fish.</p>
			<p>
				Some of the Spray tool's controls are similar to those of the Calligraphic pen (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.2">14.2</a>). To start, set the <span class="ui">Width</span> of the circular area you will be painting, using relative zoom-independent units; the maximum width of 100 gives an area approximately half as tall as the height of your screen. Then, you can adjust the <span class="ui">Amount</span> of the copies spewed out as you drag (think of it as the <em>rate</em> of painting).</p>
			<p>
				Next, you can change how much random <span class="ui">Rotation</span> and <span class="ui">Scale</span> are applied to the copies—from zero (same-size copies in the same orientation) to 100 (free rotation and scaling from zero to twice as big as the original). Within the painting area, you can vary how much <span class="ui">Scatter</span> and <span class="ui">Focus</span> to use, from zero (concentrated in the center of the area) to 100 (evenly spread over the entire area).  Inkscape supports pressure-sensitive input devices, such as Wacom tablets (<a href="c03.xhtml#section3.3">3.3</a>), and this tool allows you to apply pressure to vary the painting area size, rate of painting, or scaling of the copies—or any combination of these.</p>
			<p>
				On the left end of the controls bar, the <span class="ui">Mode</span> switch controls what the Spray tool creates: plain copies (the default), clones (<a href="c16.xhtml#ch16">Chapter 16</a>), or subpaths of a single path (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.1.1">12.1.1</a>). Here, copies are  objects that you can change independently from the original, whereas clones are automatically updated to reflect the style and shape of the original and cannot be edited on their own (other than by transforming). The subpaths mode creates a single path object (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.1">12.1</a>), where overlapping objects are merged together as if by the path union operation (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.2">12.2</a>).  The fourth <span class="ui">Mode</span> button enables a spray-specific eraser: in this mode the tool selectively deletes, within its paint area, previously sprayed copies or clones of the selected object(s) but leaves any other objects alone.</p>
				<a id="section4.7.1"/>
				<h3>4.7.1 Tracing by Spraying</h3>
			<p>At the right end of the Spray tool's controls bar, there are widgets that set up a different way of spraying: tracing the background. When
tracing, Inkscape no longer spews out copies of objects blindly but looks at what is there under your mouse pointer. It samples
the color and opacity of the existing drawing in the spraying area and uses those values to modify the way it sprays. (This functionality is available only 
when spraying copies or clones, not subpaths.)</p>
			<p>
				Often, though not always, the already-existing object you're spraying over will be a bitmap—for example, a photo. Using tracing, you can literally
re-paint, or at least over-paint, a photo in a striking artistic manner using any kind of objects as your "brush."  This is similar to a few other Inkscape features
I'll be discussing later, such as the Calligraphic pen tracing (<a href="c16.xhtml#section16.6.6">16.6.6</a>) and the <span class="ui">Trace</span> tab in the <span class="ui">Create Tiled Clones</span> dialog (<a href="c16.xhtml#section16.6">16.6</a>).</p>
			<p>
				The first two toggle buttons in this area, those with the eye open and eye closed, let you control where you want your spray to appear. When the eye-open button is pressed, sprayed objects can appear over opaque objects; when the eye-closed button is pressed, they can appear over transparent objects, transparent <a id="67"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_67" title="67"/>areas of bitmaps, or empty canvas. By default, both of these buttons are pressed—that is, you can spray anywhere.</p>
			<p>
				Next come the two no-overlap buttons. The plain <em>no-overlap option</em> (similar to the Unclump feature, <a href="c07.xhtml#section7.5.2">7.5.2</a>) ensures that the sprayed objects do not
touch each other, which makes the result look much neater. When this button is pressed, you can additionally specify how far you want the objects
to be from one another; negative values are allowed too, which means you can have a controlled partial overlap.</p>
			<p>
				The other no-overlap button pays attention to the colors under the mouse pointer: it allows overlapping only within areas of the same background color.
This way, you can pile up objects inside single-colored cells but avoid crossing the cell boundaries, as shown in <a href="#fig4-9">Figure 4-9</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig4-9"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="05/spray-trace.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 4-9: Using the Spray tool with color tracing and no-overlap options</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Finally, if you press the button with the eyedropper, you enable the <em>pick color</em> mode where Inkscape picks the color and opacity from the mouse point. The rest of the buttons on the toolbar affect how exactly this picking is done and what to do with the picked values. Specifically, you can assign the color to the objects' fill (that's what <a href="#fig4-9">Figure 4-9</a> demonstrates) and/or stroke; you can invert the picked color; and you can pick it from the exact point of the mouse pointer (instead of averaged over the tool's paint area).</p>
			<p>
				Remember that you can always trim down or thin your sprays, without completely undoing them, using the Eraser mode of the tool. Also, the versatile Tweak tool is indispensable in the toolbox of a spray artist. With it, you can easily nudge, sway, jitter, scale up or down, rotate, or multiply your sprayed objects (<a href="c06.xhtml#section6.10">6.10</a>), as well as style them by shifting their color, opacity, or blur (<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.9">8.9</a>).</p>
				<a id="section4.8"/>
				<h2>4.8 Groups</h2>
			<p><em>Grouping</em> is a way to make a single object out of a number of independent objects. It
is an easily reversible action: objects combined into a group can be ungrouped and made
independent again. Moreover, many of Inkscape's tools disregard grouping
and work directly with individual objects, whether they are grouped or not.
The Selector tool by default selects the group as a whole—but even in it, there are
methods to select an object inside the group without ungrouping it (<a href="c05.xhtml#section5.10">5.10</a>).</p>
			<p>
				To group some objects, just select them and choose <span class="ui"><strong>Object<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Group</strong></span>
(Ctrl-G). Groups can be themselves grouped just like any other objects. You can
even group a single object—for example, select a rectangle and press Ctrl-G.
Now you <a id="68"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_68" title="68"/>have a group with a single rectangle inside. Such groups may be useful in some situations,
such as blurring a clipped object (see <a href="c18.xhtml#section18.3">18.3</a>).</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>
				</div>
				<section class="box">
					<h2>Groups Are Parents</h2>
					<p>
						In SVG, a group is the <code>g</code> element (see <a href="b01.xhtml#sectionA.5">A.5</a>), which is a<em>parent</em> of its member objects. This means, among other things, that objects with
unset style properties (<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.2">8.2</a>) will inherit these properties from their parent group or
from an ancestor further up the tree.</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<p>
				When a single group is selected, the status bar indicates how many member objects are
within this group—for example, <span class="ui">Group of 3 objects in layer Background</span>.</p>
			<a id="section4.8.1"/><h3>4.8.1 Ungrouping</h3>
			<p>
				To ungroup a group, select it and choose <span class="ui"><strong>Object<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Ungroup</strong></span>
(Ctrl-U or Ctrl-Shift-G). The group no longer exists, but all its former members, now released,
remain where they were on the canvas—both the coordinates and the z-order of the objects are
preserved.</p>
			<p>
				You can select any number of groups and ungroup them all at once. Moreover, you can
select any number of different objects, only <em>some</em> of which are groups, and
press Ctrl-U: groups will be ungrouped and all nongroup objects will remain
intact.</p>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Ungroup</span> command removes only the topmost level of
grouping. For example, if you have a group containing two other groups, pressing
Ctrl-U will release the two groups—they will stay selected but not 
ungrouped. You will need to press Ctrl-U again to ungroup them. To ungroup
all groups in a complex drawing, just select all objects and keep pressing
Ctrl-U until the status bar says, <span class="ui">No groups to ungroup in the</span><span class="ui">selection</span>.</p>
			<p>
				Finally, if you have so many levels of grouping that manual ungrouping does not sound like fun, try the<span class="ui"><strong>Extensions<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Arrange<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Deep Ungroup</strong></span> extension. It will  ungroup your document all the way down to subatomic particles—or,
if you prefer, you can control precisely how many levels to ungroup and how many (counting from the bottom)
to leave intact.</p>
			<a id="section4.8.2"/><h3>4.8.2 Uses of Grouping</h3>
			<p>There are several good reasons to group objects:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					First, groups provide an easy way to <em>select sets of objects</em>. With the Selector tool,
click any object in a group, and the entire group gets selected. In this sense, a
group is a "saved selection." After selecting, it is easy to move, scale, or paint the
group just as you would a number of separate selected objects.</li>
				<li>
					Second, grouping is a natural way to <em>organize complex
artwork</em>. When you have thousands of objects in your drawing, sorting out what
belongs together is difficult. One way to structure such complex
documents is via layers, as discussed later in this chapter. Often, however, layers
are too much hassle—for example, if you just want to ensure that the nose and
the eyes in your portrait <a id="69"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_69" title="69"/>are never accidentally moved relative to each other, the
easiest way to do that is by grouping them together.</li>
				<li>
					Finally, sometimes groups allow you to achieve effects that would be impossible
otherwise. One such effect is <em>group transparency</em> (see <a href="c08.xhtml#section8.3">8.3</a> for
more on transparency).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				When you apply transparency to a group, it is made transparent <em>as
a whole</em>, which may look quite different from applying the same level of
transparency to the individual objects, as shown in <a href="#fig4-10">Figure 4-10</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig4-10"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="05/grouptransparency.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 4-10: Group transparency</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>On the left, two independent objects are fully opaque (zero transparency). In the
middle, they are made 50 percent transparent as individual objects; note that the corner of
the rectangle shows through the ellipse. On the right, the original opaque objects are
grouped and then the group is made 50 percent transparent; now, the checkered background
shows through, but the overlapping area of the rectangle is still obscured by the ellipse
and does not show through.</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>
				</div>
				<section class="note">
					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>Because of group transparency and other similar effects,
ungrouping a group does not, in the general case, 
guarantee that the document's appearance will not
change.</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<a id="section4.8.3"/>
			<h3>4.8.3 Groups and Z-Order</h3>
			<p>An important thing to remember is that a group, as an object in its own right, has
its own place in the z-order stack of your document, and all the members of the
group share its z-order position.</p>
			<p>This means that if object A is on top of B, and B is on
top of C, you cannot group A and C without changing the z-order. If you attempt to do
that, C will jump up on top of B, and you will have a group containing A and C lying on top
of the object B.</p>
			<p>Ungrouping, in that case, will not restore the original z-order. If you ungroup 
the "A and C" group,
you will have three independent objects, but they will be now in the order A, C, B (top
to bottom). (Of course, if you simply Ctrl-Z to undo right after grouping,
both grouping and the z-order change will be reverted.)</p>
			<p>For the same reason, you cannot group objects from different layers. Both layers and
groups are branches of the XML tree of the document, and you cannot have a branch (group)
growing from more than one parent branch (layer). If you try to group objects
selected in different layers or within different groups, Inkscape will complain (with a
message in the status bar) and do nothing.</p>
			<a id="section4.9"/><h2>
				4.9 <a id="70"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_70" title="70"/>Layers</h2>
			<p>Layers in Inkscape are just what the name suggests: "levels" or "floors"
within a document, stacked on top of each other and containing other objects. Every
layer has a name. Layers are easy to hide (make invisible), lock (prevent changes), or rearrange.</p>
			<p>
				Every object belongs to one and only one layer. To find out which layer the object belongs to, just select that
object and look at the status bar. It will say something like <span class="ui">Rectangle in layer
Layer 1</span>; here, <span class="ui">Layer 1</span> is the name of the layer.
You can, of course, select objects
from different layers, in which case the status bar will say, for example, <span class="ui">2 objects in 2
layers</span>.</p>
			<p>
				One of the layers in the document is always <em>current</em>.  Any new objects you
create, paste, or import are added to the current layer.
To make layers
in complex drawings easier to work with, Inkscape's current layer <em>follows selection</em>. That is, if you are
in layer A and select some objects in layer B (for example, by clicking it), layer B becomes your new current
layer. Conversely, if you change the current layer, your selection is deselected.</p>
			<p>
				Inkscape remembers the current layer when saving the document and restores it when
you load it afterward. A new document template (see <a href="c03.xhtml#section3.2">3.2</a>) usually contains one initial
layer called <span class="ui">Layer 1</span>; it is current when you load the template—so, if you
don't create any new layers, all your objects will end up in Layer 1.</p>
			<p>
				Just like individual objects, layers may be locked or hidden. In a<em>locked</em> layer, objects are visible but cannot be selected. In a <em>hidden</em> layer,
objects are both invisible and cannot be selected. You cannot add new objects
to a layer that's either hidden or locked.</p>
			<p>Typically, layers are hidden when you want to simplify a complex piece of artwork
to concentrate on some parts of it. Hiding complex layers may speed up screen redraw
considerably and thus make working more comfortable. Locking layers is useful when you
want some background objects to be visible but not selectable—usually to make it easier to
select the foreground objects by clicking or dragging around them.</p>
			<a id="section4.9.1"/><h3>4.9.1 Layer Hierarchy</h3>
			<p>At a more advanced level, layers in Inkscape are closely related to groups. In fact, a
layer is just a kind of group that Inkscape treats in a special way.</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>
				</div>
				<section class="box">
					<h2>Layers Are Groups</h2>
					<p>
						In SVG, both layers and groups are represented by the same element,<code>g</code>. The only difference is that a layer has the attribute<code>inkscape:groupmode="layer"</code> (<a href="b01.xhtml#sectionA.5">A.5</a>).</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<p>
				Just as groups may include other groups as members, layers may contain further<em>sublayers</em>. This is useful for organizing complex artwork. Instead of a flat
list of layers, you may have a hierarchical tree, where related layers are grouped by
a common parent. You can then manage your document by raising/lowering <a id="71"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_71" title="71"/>or hiding/locking the
entire branches of the tree instead of individual layers one by one.</p>
			<p>
				Even better, you can <em>enter a group</em>. That means telling Inkscape
to temporarily treat a group as a sublayer and to make that sublayer current. To do this, just
select the group and double-click it, or press Ctrl-Enter, or right-click it
and choose <span class="ui"><strong>Enter group</strong></span> from the pop-up menu.</p>
			<p>
				This trick combines the advantages of groups (a group is easy to select, 
move, transform, style, view its bounding box, and so on) with the advantages of
layers (a layer defines a context that you can comfortably work in—for example, by
adding new objects to it). In particular, the easiest way to move some object <em>into</em> an
existing group without ungrouping is to cut the object (Ctrl-X), enter the
group, and paste the object there (Ctrl-V, or Ctrl-Alt-V if you want to preserve its position).</p>
			<p>
				To leave a sublayer—whether it's a real sublayer or just a group that you entered—press Ctrl-Backspace, or double-click
an empty canvas area, or right-click anywhere and choose <span class="ui"><strong>Go to Parent</strong></span> from the pop-up menu.</p>
			<a id="section4.9.2"/><h3>4.9.2 The Layer Menu</h3>
			<p>
				The most important layer commands are collected in the <span class="ui">Layer</span> menu:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The <span class="ui">Add Layer</span> command  creates a new layer and asks you for its name (<a href="#fig4-11">Figure 4-11</a>).
You can also choose whether to place it above the current layer
(default), below the current layer, or inside the current layer as a sublayer. Layer
names need not be unique and can use arbitrary characters. In SVG source, the name of the layer is stored in the<code>inkscape:label</code> attribute.<a id="fig4-11"/><figure>
						<img alt="" src="05/addlayer.png"/>
						<figcaption>
							<p>Figure 4-11: Creating a new layer</p>
						</figcaption>
					</figure>
					</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Rename Layer</span>, <span class="ui">Duplicate Current Layer</span>, and <span class="ui">Delete Current Layer</span> commands do what they say they do. Duplicating a layer duplicates all of the objects in it. Similarly (be careful!), deleting a layer deletes all objects that were in that layer.</li>
				<li>
					The two <span class="ui">Switch</span> commands just switch the current layer to one below or
above it. These commands simply define the context for other operations; they
do not change anything in the document and are therefore not undoable (only the commands
that actually change the document can be undone).</li>
				<li>
					The next two commands, <span class="ui">Move Selection to Layer Above</span>
(Shift-Page Up) and <span class="ui">Move Selection to Layer Below</span>
(Shift-Page Down), take the current selection and transport it to the layer above or
below the current one. (If there is no layer above or below the current one, these commands
do nothing and complain in the status bar.) By crossing the layer
boundaries, these <a id="72"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_72" title="72"/>commands are complementary to the regular z-order changing commands, such as<span class="ui">Raise</span> or <span class="ui">Lower</span> (<a href="#section4.4">4.4</a>), that work within the same layer.
					<p>
						To move an object from one layer to any other, not necessarily adjacent,
cut the
object <span class="rm">(Ctrl-X)</span>, switch to the target layer, and paste it in place<span class="rm">(Ctrl-Alt-V).</span> If you need to extract an object from a group, select it
inside its group (<a href="c05.xhtml#section5.10">5.10</a>) and use <span class="ui"><strong>Object<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Pop Selected Objects out of Group</strong></span>.</p>
			</li>
				<li>
					The four z-order commands—<span class="ui">Raise Layer</span> (Shift-Ctrl-Page Up),<span class="ui">Lower Layer</span> (Shift-Ctrl-Page Down), <span class="ui">Layer to Top</span>
(Shift-Ctrl-Home), and <span class="ui">Layer to Bottom</span> (Shift-Ctrl-End)—are 
equivalent to the z-order commands for objects (<a href="#section4.4">4.4</a>), except that they act on the
current layer by moving it (with all of its objects and sublayers) up or down among its sibling
layers. As you may notice, the keyboard shortcuts for these commands are the same as for the
object z-order commands but with Shift-Ctrl added.</li>
				<li>
					Finally, the <span class="ui">Layers...</span> command (Shift-Ctrl-L) opens the<span class="ui">Layers</span> dialog (<a href="#section4.9.4">4.9.4</a>).</li>
			</ul><a id="section4.9.3"/>
			<h3>4.9.3 The Current Layer Indicator</h3>
			<p>
				Inkscape has two main UI controls for working with layers: the basic
current layer indicator in the status bar and the more powerful <span class="ui">Layers</span>
dialog.</p>
			<p>
				The <em>current layer indicator</em> displays the name of the current layer and, with the two
toggle buttons on the left, indicates whether that layer is hidden (the eye button) and/or locked 
(the lock button), as shown in <a href="#fig4-12">Figure 4-12</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig4-12"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="05/cli.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 4-12: The current layer indicator in the status bar</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				It's an interactive control, not just a display; you can toggle the buttons and use
the pop-up menu of all layers to change the current layer (<a href="#fig4-13">Figure 4-13</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig4-13"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="05/cli-open.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 4-13: The pop-up menu of all layers in the
document</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				In the list of the layers, the current layer is marked with bold face and a
bullet. Locked layers have square brackets around their names (for example,<span class="ui">[background]</span>). Hidden layers' names are gray. A temporary layer (such as a group
that you entered, <a href="c05.xhtml#section5.10">5.10</a>) uses italics for its name.</p>
			<a id="section4.9.4"/><h3>
				4.9.4 <a id="73"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_73" title="73"/>The Layers Dialog</h3>
			<p>
				The current layer indicator is handy because it is always active and takes 
little space on screen. However, it is adequate only if your layer structure is small
and simple. In more complex documents, it quickly becomes unwieldy. That's when you
need to use the <span class="ui">Layers</span> dialog (Shift-Ctrl-L), shown in <a href="#fig4-14">Figure 4-14</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig4-14"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="05/layers.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 4-14: The <span class="ui">Layers</span> dialog</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>In the list of layers, you can expand and collapse branches of sublayers inside layers
by clicking the triangle markers. Also, you can lock or unlock and
hide or unhide any layer, without making it current, by clicking the corresponding icon
to the left of the layer name.</p>
			<p>
				Under the list of layers, the six buttons correspond to the following commands, left
to right: <span class="ui">Create a new layer</span> (you need to provide a name), <span class="ui">Delete the current layer</span>, <span class="ui">Raise the current layer to the top</span>, <span class="ui">Raise the current layer</span>, <span class="ui">Lower the lower layer</span>, <span class="ui">Lower the current layer to the bottom</span>. To rename a layer, simply click its name in the list and type
a new name, then press Enter.</p>
			<p>Right-click a layer name to open a pop-up menu. Apart from the familiar commands for adding,
renaming, lowering/raising, or duplicating a layer, it contains commands that let you hide/show
and lock/unlock either all layers or all layers except the one you clicked on.</p>
			<p>
				At the bottom of the dialog, there's a list of blend modes that can be applied to the
entire current layer (<a href="c17.xhtml#section17.2">17.2</a>). Further down, two
slider controls let you set the opacity or blur level of the entire current layer. These controls affect all
the objects in the layer as a whole (see <a href="#section4.8.2">4.8.2</a> about group opacity).</p>
			<a id="section4.9.5"/><h3>
				4.9.5 <a id="74"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_74" title="74"/>The Objects Dialog</h3>
			<p>
				Unlike Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape's <span class="ui">Layers</span> dialog does not show
individual objects within layers. There is another dialog, called simply <span class="ui">Objects</span>
(<span class="ui">Object<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Objects</span>), which does list all individual objects in the layer hierarchy (<a href="#fig4-15">Figure 4-15</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig4-15"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="05/objects.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 4-15: The <span class="ui">Objects</span> dialog</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				In many ways, this dialog duplicates the <span class="ui">Layers</span> dialog. You can add or remove layers, rearrange them, or
set the blend mode (<a href="c17.xhtml#section17.2">17.2</a>), blur, and opacity levels for any layer or an individual object. You can
toggle the visible (<span class="ui">V</span> column) and locked (<span class="ui">L</span>) status of any object, and you can convert groups
to layers and back (click the icon in the <span class="ui">T</span> column for a group or layer). The dialog also marks objects that are clipped or masked
(<span class="ui">CM</span>) and lets you choose the color of the path highlight (<span class="ui">HL</span>) that this object—if it's a path—will have in the
Node tool (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.5.1">12.5.1</a>).</p>
			<a id="section4.10"/><h2>4.10 The XML Editor</h2>
			<p>The XML Editor is one of the things that set Inkscape apart from other vector editors. This is where
you can see the entire raw source of your document, with nothing hidden or
(mis)interpreted. Simply put, if something is not shown in the XML Editor, it's not
in your document.</p>
			<p>If you're learning SVG or are simply interested in what lies behind some of the
objects or properties of your document, the XML Editor is the tool for you. Here, you can
do absolutely anything to your document. I might even say that  XML Editor is the only
essential part of the program, everything else being optional conveniences!</p>
			<p>The XML Editor is completely synchronized with the rest of Inkscape. Any change you
make in the XML tree is immediately reflected on your canvas, and any change you make with
any other tool is immediately visible as an element or attribute change in the XML
Editor.</p>
			<p><a id="75"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_75" title="75"/>The XML Editor has two main panes for the document tree and the attributes of the selected node (<a href="#fig4-16">Figure 4-16</a>).
You can arrange these panes horizontally or vertically (with the toggle in the bottom-right corner).
You can also hide the attributes pane with the <span class="ui">Show attributes</span> switch, bottom left.</p>
			<a id="fig4-16"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="05/xmleditor.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 4-16: The XML Editor</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<a id="section4.10.1"/>
			<h3>4.10.1 The Tree Pane</h3>
			<p>
				This pane shows the entire tree of the document you are
editing. Each node of the tree (each line in this list) is either an XML
element or a text node. In SVG, text nodes are used only for holding the text
content of text objects; all other objects are element nodes. For example,<code>svg:rect</code> is a rectangle, and <code>svg:g</code> is either a group or a layer
(here, <code>svg</code> is the namespace prefix; see <a href="b01.xhtml#sectionA.2">A.2</a>).
Of all the attributes a node might have, this pane only shows the <code>id</code>
attribute (which is unique, so it's a natural way to tell nodes of the same type apart).</p>
			<p>
				Not every element in the list is a visible Inkscape object. Some elements represent things
(such as metadata) that you don't see on the canvas. For more on various SVG and
Inkscape elements, refer to <a href="b01.xhtml#chA">Appendix A</a>.</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>
				</div>
				<section class="note">
					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>
						In the XML Editor, all elements are listed in the <em>document order</em>. This means that the objects
and layers that are <em>topmost</em> in the z-order on the canvas are the <em>last</em> (bottommost) in the
list. In particular, the order of layers in the XML Editor is reversed
compared to the order in the <span class="ui">Layers</span> dialog or the current layer indicator.</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<p>
				In the document tree, you can select any element by clicking it. This
list selection is synchronized with the regular object selection in Inkscape. If
the selected node corresponds to a visible object, that object gets selected on the
canvas; conversely, when you select an object on canvas, the XML tree pane scrolls to the
corresponding node and highlights it. This is one way to reach elements that are
otherwise inaccessible, such as those that are locked or hidden (<a href="#section4.1">4.1</a>).</p>
			<p>
				Above the tree pane, there's a small toolbar with buttons for generic XML
operations: creating a new element or text node and duplicating or deleting the selected
node. The last four buttons are for moving the selected node (and its children) in
the tree. You can shift a node sideways to change the nesting level (the left arrow button converts a
node from a child of its parent to its sibling; <a id="76"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_76" title="76"/>the right arrow button converts a node into a child of
its preceding sibling) or use the up/down arrows to move a node
among its siblings. You can also rearrange nodes by dragging them within the tree.</p>
			<a id="section4.10.2"/><h3>4.10.2 The Attributes Pane</h3>
			<p>This pane lists the attributes of the
selected element node. (If you select a text node, this pane
lets you edit the text of the node as if it were an attribute named "content".)
Every attribute has a name and a value,
listed in the two columns of a table. The order of the attributes does not
matter in XML.</p>
			<p>
				To edit the value of an attribute, just click it and edit in place (<a href="#fig4-17">Figure 4-17</a>). If
the existing value is too long to fit on one line, a convenient little
window pops out where you can edit the auto-wrapped value. (This is typically the case
for <code>style</code> attributes; however, see <a href="c08.xhtml#section8.1">8.1</a>
for a more convenient way to edit an object's style properties.) Pressing
Enter accepts the changes.</p>

			<p>To delete an attribute, click the red "x" button in the left column. To add a new one,
use the blue plus button at the top of that column.</p>

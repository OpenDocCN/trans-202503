Ideally, this would allow developers to solve different problems using the best language for the job. In practice, things didn’t really work out that way, as developers tended to adopt either C# or Visual Basic and build entire solutions with that language. This is hardly surprising given that, with few exceptions, the differences between the languages have historically been purely syntactic (and the languages have only grown closer as the platform has matured).</p><p>Now, after more than a decade, F# has emerged as the third major language in the .NET ecosystem. But what does F# offer that the traditional .NET languages do not, and why should you care?</p><p>F# brings functional programming to .NET development. While both C# and Visual Basic have some functional aspects, they are, first and foremost, object-oriented languages; they’re concerned primarily with behavior and managing an ever-changing system state. In contrast, F# is a functional-first language, concerned with the application of functions to data. This difference has a dramatic impact not only on how you write code, but also on how you think about it.</p><p>As you read through this book, you’ll learn how F#’s functional nature enforces a variety of constraints that may seem limiting at first, but once you embrace them you’ll likely find that your code is smaller, more correct, and more predictable. Furthermore, you’ll discover how F#’s many unique constructs simplify common development tasks, thus allowing you to focus on the problem you’re trying to solve rather than the plumbing required by the compiler. These aspects make F# a perfect complement to C# and Visual Basic, often paving the way toward realizing .NET’s goal of mixed-language solutions.</p><div class="sect1" title="Whom Is This Book For?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="whom_is_this_book_forquestion_mark">Whom Is This Book For?</h2></div></div></div><p>I have been developing software professionally with C# on the .NET platform since its earliest public releases back in 2002 and 2003. Thus, I wrote this book for people like me: experienced .NET developers looking to break into functional programming while retaining the safety net of the tools and libraries they’re already using.</p><p>While this book is written with an emphasis on .NET development, experienced developers approaching F# from other backgrounds should still find plenty of value within these pages, as the principles covered aren’t typically platform specific.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="How Is This Book Organized?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="how_is_this_book_organizedquestion_mark">How Is This Book Organized?</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The Book of F#</em></span> is divided into 12 chapters intended to introduce you to each of the major language features. I recommend that you read this book from beginning to end rather than skipping around, as each chapter builds upon the concepts introduced by its predecessors.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none"><p title="Chapter 1"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Meet F#">Chapter 1</a></strong></span></strong></span>. Provides your first glimpse of F# and describes its place within the .NET ecosystem. In this chapter, you’ll learn what you need to begin coding in F#, how projects are structured, and some of the nuances that can catch newcomers to the language off guard.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: none"><p title="Chapter 2"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. F# Interactive">Chapter 2</a></strong></span></strong></span>. Covers the F# Interactive environment, an indispensable <span class="emphasis"><em>read-evaluate-print loop (REPL)</em></span> tool that ships with F#.

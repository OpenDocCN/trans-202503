    learn increasingly complex sketching tools, features, and techniques. By the end
    of the book, you’ll be a master of 3D modeling and have the skills to design whatever

    Fusion 360, which you’ll use more than any of the complex tools in the chapters
    to come. Just like how a skilled carpenter can do amazing things with a handful
    of basic tools, you’ll learn how to construct models using use simple tools like
    Extrude and Revolve. These foundational tools may not be glamorous or designed
    for specialized work, but they’re powerful and useful for a wide variety of tasks.

    on which plane the sketch will be drawn. When you haven’t yet started a model,
    you will usually select one of the x-y, y-z, or z-x planes, and if you’ve already
    started building a model, you’ll usually select a flat face as a sketch plane.
    You can also start a sketch by selecting one of the sketch tools, like the Line
    tool, and then choosing a plane.'

    to form shapes. This tool is so frequently used it gets a default keyboard shortcut
    key: L.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Rectangle** Creates four line segments automatically joined with *constraints*,
    or rules that specify how sketch entities are linked. For example, a constraint
    might lock the endpoints of two line segments together, make an arc tangent to
    a straight line, or make two lines parallel. In this case, the Rectangle tool
    automatically constrains the endpoints of the four lines and makes them perpendicular
    to each other. The submenu contains options for defining the rectangle, and the
    keyboard shortcut R draws two-point rectangles that are defined by any two corners.'

- en: '**Circle** Draws circles. Multiple options are available under the submenu
    for defining and positioning the circle. Sketch circles are true mathematical
    circles—they’re not divided into arcs or a series of line segments. The C shortcut
    creates a circle defined by its centerpoint and diameter.'

    to define the constraints of the arc. Since arcs aren’t as common as the other
    shapes, the Arc tool doesn’t have a keyboard shortcut.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Fillet** A *fillet* (pronounced “fill-it”) is a frequently-used tool for
    rounding a sketch’s corner. You define it by the radius of the arc that joins
    the two lines. When you use it in a sketch, this tool automatically cuts two line
    segments short, places an arc connecting them, and constrains that arc to be tangent
    to both line segments.'

    to make initial features, which you’ll combine to create 3D shapes. You must always
    use one of these initial features to create your first 3D entity because they
    don’t require any existing model geometry to work off of (though a sketch may
    be required). This contrasts with the tools from the Modify menu, which only work
    with existing geometry. Keep in mind that you can use these tools to create features
    throughout the modeling process, and not just to create initial features.

    feature is also used to cut into an existing solid in the shape of a selected
    sketch. This is the most common feature in 3D modeling, and the keyboard shortcut
    is E.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Revolve** Similar to Extrude, this feature creates a new solid or cuts an
    existing solid from a sketch. The Revolve feature makes a solid body by revolving
    the sketch around a selected center axis by a specified number of degrees. For
    example, a square that touches the axis of revolution would form a cylinder if
    it were revolved a full 360 degrees.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Hole** Streamlines the process of cutting a hole in a solid. With Extrude
    and Revolve, you can create a hole of any shape you can sketch, but using the
    Hole feature can sometimes be faster for creating simple holes. But since cutting
    holes with Extrude or Revolve is more common and versatile, I typically avoid
    using Hole.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Box, Cylinder, Sphere, Torus, Coil, and Pipe** These features create primitive
    solids. Like the Hole feature, these features can all save time in some situations—mostly
    as basic starting points—but for learning purposes, you won’t be using them in
    this book. You can create each of these (with the possible exception of the Coil
    feature) with Extrude or Revolve.'

    now (Extrude and Revolve), but they’re powerful and useful. In fact, Extrude and

    two edges.'

    Go to the **Sketch** drop-down menu and select the **Create Sketch** option. You
    should be asked to choose a plane on which to draw the sketch. [Figure 3-4](ch03.xhtml#ch03fig4)
    shows the sketch on the xy-plane. The plane you choose is completely up to you—you
    can always rotate models at a later point, so it’s really about how you want to

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because you’re modeling a cube, start by sketching a rectangle. In this case,
    you want a *center rectangle*. This means the rectangle will be constrained to
    stay centered on the origin point, or (0, 0, 0). Constraints are geometric rules
    that apply to sketch entities. For instance, a perpendicular constraint forces
    two lines to meet at a 90 degree angle. Keeping your models constrained to the
    origin is typically good practice, because it will make using the default reference
    planes and axes easier in the future.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now navigate to **Sketch** ▸ **Rectangle** ▸ **Center Rectangle**. A dialog
    offering various options should pop up on your screen. Clicking the plane determines
    the centerpoint, so click the origin to automatically create the rectangle’s first
    constraint. Your next click should place a corner of the rectangle, so just click
    off in space a bit away from the origin so you get something rectangular, as shown
    in [Figure 3-5](ch03.xhtml#ch03fig5). The point you click should be mirrored across
    both the x- and y-axes—automatically placing all four points of the rectangle.

    You could have specified one of them, pressed TAB, entered dimensions for the
    other, and then pressed ENTER. This would have defined the dimensions of the rectangle
    and constrained it to them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But because you didn’t do that and just clicked a point in space, Fusion drew
    the rectangle without any associated dimensions. This means that the rectangle
    is constrained to be centered on the origin, the endpoints of the four lines are
    automatically locked together with coincident constraints, and the four lines
    are constrained to be perpendicular to each other. But, it doesn’t have any dimensions
    to constrain its actual size.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At this point, the four lines of your rectangle should be blue, which by default
    signifies that a sketch isn’t completely constrained. You should never finish
    a sketch without it being completely constrained with geometrical constraints
    or dimensions. Until the sketch is completely constrained, points and lines could
    unintentionally shift, which leads to ambiguity about the accuracy of the part;
    and when it comes to CAD, ambiguity is always bad.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To completely constrain the rectangle, you need to define the dimensions of
    the part. Use the D shortcut to create a sketch dimension—or choose it from the
    Sketch menu—and select a vertical line. Move your cursor off to the side of the
    line and click to place the dimension. Then enter **50** and press ENTER. Do the
    same for one of the horizontal lines. The dimensions should display as shown in

    default Photobooth visual environment (colors may look different if you change
    the environment). That means you’ve completely constrained the rectangle, and
    nothing unexpected should happen later on that might affect the precision of the
    sketch. Ensuring sketches are always fully constrained should keep you from having
    to chase down problems when you’re working with more complex models. Leaving a
    sketch partially unconstrained won’t break anything, but it can cause unpredictable
    results if the sketch or features shift.

    choose **Create** ▸ **Extrude**. The view should shift to make it easier to tell
    what your extrusion is doing, and you’ll be asked to choose a *profile*, which
    is any closed loop in a sketch. In this case, your profile is your rectangle,
    so click somewhere inside it. Like in [Figure 3-7](ch03.xhtml#ch03fig7), the selected
    profile should be highlighted. Although it doesn’t apply here, you can select
    multiple profiles if they’re on the same plane by clicking inside them when the

    of the sketch plane, both sides with different distances, or both sides with symmetrical
    distances. You want your cube to stay centered on the origin point, so choose
    **Symmetric**. When you select Symmetric, you’ll be asked if the dimension refers
    to total extrusion length or per side. You want total so that all dimensions match.
    Set the Distance option to 50 mm with a 0 degree taper angle.

    have any other solid bodies in your model, New Body is the only option that makes
    sense, but if you wanted to cut a hole in an existing body, you could use Cut.
    Other options are Intersect, which keeps just the section where two solids overlap,

    use a symmetric extrusion. When you select a sketch plane, the origin point is

    symmetrically around the origin. Now when you center your circle on the origin,
    you know that it’s also centered on the face of the cube. If your cube wasn’t
    centered on the origin, you’d have to use additional constraints, construction
    geometry, or dimensions to center the circle on the face.

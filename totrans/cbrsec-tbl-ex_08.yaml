    audience, such as information technology and information security staff. Depending
    on the organization, participants might include team members from the security
    operations center and the help desk, database and network administrators, and
    relevant technical management, among others. Because the examples in this chapter
    are more technical than the example scenarios in [Chapters 7](chapter7.xhtml)
    and [8](chapter8.xhtml), you’ll need to make significant changes to address the
    technical nuances of your organization.

    on the people, processes, and technology in place to handle the given scenario,
    with specific emphasis on the technological issues to address during a cybersecurity
    incident. However, the exercise shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that technology
    exists to enable the business. If the developed scenario would elicit a collective
    “So what?” from business leaders, it’s possible the exercise isn’t aligned with
    the organization’s needs.

    being used in organizations across the globe, so it had an established, trusted

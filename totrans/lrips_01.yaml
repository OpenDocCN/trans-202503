    sign. “A mile sounds like a long way to walk, but it’s easier if you break it
    into pieces.” She remembered that in Hamilton there are eight blocks to a mile,
    so she made herself think about walking one block at a time.

    crops, an empty road, and the sign.'

    coloring: where the sign was green, the lizard was reddish; where it was white,
    the lizard was black.'

    on, can you *see* me?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Of course I can see you!” Laurie said.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Oh.” Xor looked very sad and blushed a bright purple.

    learn to talk?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “What a silly question!” the creature said. “I learned as a baby, like everybody
    else.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “You did?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Sure. Why, how did *you* learn to talk?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Well . . .” She had always been able to talk, hadn’t she? “I guess I learned
    as a baby too.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “It’s only logical. First you learn to talk, then you learn to think. Too bad
    it’s not the other way around.”

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Another silly question! What does it look like I’m doing? I am blending into
    the background,” Xor said. At that moment he turned pink and violet. “Did you
    say something?”
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Where was I? Oh, yes. Blending in is an honorable and ancient art. It takes
    years of practice. You must have a pretty sharp eye to spot me.” Xor marched around
    the sign as he talked, turning white with large orange polka dots.

    blue. “But sometimes—personally speaking between you and me, of course—sometimes
    . . .” He looked sad again and fell silent.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    keep changing.”

    around to get a better look at himself.

    who saw me and not a hungry bird. You see, I’m a bit color-blind.”

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is a Steganosaurus. She can hide anywhere, even on the back of a postage stamp.”

    feelings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    even see her!” he said.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    you’ll be able to see her, too.”

    Hamilton?”

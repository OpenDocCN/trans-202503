    lock competitions use three-wheel locks exclusively.) On top of the wheel pack
    is the *drive cam*, which is responsible for spinning the wheels when someone

    latches, higher-end padlocks use *ball bearings* that mate with half-circle cuts
    on the shackle. [Figure 3-14](ch3.xhtml#ch3fig14) highlights the difference. The
    balls roll into the housing when the correct key is used, releasing the shackle.

    pin stack is above the master pin, while the master key, which has a different

    tedious, as you must pick each pin stack multiple times while rotating the plug.
    Using specialty tubular picking tools that keep the picked pin stacks at the shear
    line is much easier but can be expensive, as you’ll need different tools for tubular
    locks of different diameters.

- en: A *wafer lock* also works similarly to a pin tumbler lock, but instead of pins,
    it contains flat, spring-loaded wafers that move up and down, riding along the
    surface of a key. A bit of metal protrudes from the top and bottom of each wafer,
    blocking the plug from rotating if the wafer is too high or too low. [Figure 3-25](ch3.xhtml#ch3fig25)
    shows a wafer plug with five wafers protruding from the top, and a sixth wafer-like
    clip that keeps the plug in the housing.

    cabinets. Low-end safes, like fire-rated document boxes and cash boxes found in
    big box stores, often feature cheap—and therefore exceptionally poor—wafer locks.

- en: Wafers are thinner than pins, so a wafer lock can hold more wafers than the
    number of pins in a pin tumbler lock of the same size. It’s common to find 10-wafer
    automotive locks. However, like dimple locks, wafer locks are typically limited
    to only three or four possible key cut depths. [Figure 3-26](ch3.xhtml#ch3fig26)
    shows a wafer lock cylinder and key.

- en: Instead of using a key, you unlock dial-based, or *combination*, locks by dialing
    a series of numbers. Combination locks range from the cheap padlocks ubiquitous
    in gym locker rooms to high-end safe locks used to secure secret government documents
    and vault doors in large banks. The method of inputting the combination and the
    internal mechanism varies among locks, so we’ll focus on safe locks—those found
    on decent safes, not the cheap, allegedly fireproof boxes you can buy at an office
    supply store.

- en: A safe lock has a dial on the face that you spin clockwise and counterclockwise
    to input a numeric combination. Behind this dial is a *dial ring*, which has an
    opening index mark, often at the 12 o’clock position, to indicate where you should
    stop when entering a number before changing direction to enter the next number
    in the combination. The dial ring also usually has a change index, typically at
    the 11 o’clock position, where you can enter a new combination if the lock is
    in its combination change state. (You do so by first unlocking the lock, then
    inserting a special *change key* into the back side.) [Figure 3-27](ch3.xhtml#ch3fig27)
    shows a dial ring and dial.

    pack. When all the wheels are aligned in the correct position, the fence drops
    into the groove created by their gates. With the fence in the gates, rotating
    the dial will pull a lever connected to the fence, which is connected to the bolt
    and opens the lock. [Figure 3-28](ch3.xhtml#ch3fig28) shows the wheel pack and
    fence of a cutaway safe lock. We’ll discuss opening safe locks in [Part IV](part4.xhtml).

- en: Rather than using pins, *lever locks* have metal levers that pivot and are lifted
    by a key. Each lever has a slot and a gate where a metal protrusion on the lock’s
    bolt, called the *stump*, rests and can pass through. When the slots on each lever
    align, the stump can pass through to unlock the door. Lever locks come in padlock
    format, but the mortise lockset format, shown in [Figure 3-29](ch3.xhtml#ch3fig29),
    is the most common type.

    are also common. [Figure 3-30](ch3.xhtml#ch3fig30) shows a key lifting the levers

    rely on *wards*—obstacles within the lock that block pieces of metal other than
    the key from activating the lever. [Figure 3-31](ch3.xhtml#ch3fig31) shows a warded

    to remove as much material as possible (leaving only the “skeleton” of the key)
    while still allowing the key to contact the lever and open the lock. Removing
    the excess material increases the likelihood that the key will work in other warded
    locks, as the metal that may have gotten bound up in the wards is gone.'

    for some applications, like furniture locks or as part of a multilayered security
    system. And with fewer moving parts than most other locking mechanisms, they’re
    sometimes purchased for low-security outdoor or industrial uses, such as lighting
    controls in public parks.

- en: Finally, the *disc detainer* is a unique locking mechanism that uses thin, round
    discs not unlike the wafers in wafer locks. However, instead of using springs
    and being lifted, the discs rotate into position. Each disc has a small gate in
    its outer edge, similar to that in a safe lock’s wheels. If the gates on every
    disc align, a *sidebar*—a metal bar that normally blocks the plug from rotating,
    somewhat akin to a fence—drops into the groove, and the plug can then rotate to
    open the lock (see [Chapter 7](ch7.xhtml)). The bitting on a disc detainer key
    is a series of angled cuts designed to align the discs.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because of their unique design, picking disc detainer locks requires specialty
    tools. In addition, different models often require different tools because of
    variations in the way the locks are tensioned or in the shape of the keyway. The
    number of discs in each lock can range from a few in basic models to more than
    10 in higher-end offerings.

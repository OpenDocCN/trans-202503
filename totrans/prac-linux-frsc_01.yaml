    The earliest computer-related forensics work began during the 1980s, a time when
    practitioners were almost exclusively from law enforcement or military organizations.
    During the 1980s, the growth of home computers and dial-up bulletin board services
    triggered early interest in computer forensics within law enforcement communities.
    In 1984, the FBI developed a pioneering program to analyze computer evidence.
    In addition, the increase in abuse and internet-based attacks led to the creation
    of the first Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) in 1988\. CERT was formed
    by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and is located at Carnegie-Mellon
    University in Pittsburgh.

    home became commonplace. During this time, computer forensics was a major topic
    among law enforcement agencies. In 1993, the FBI hosted the first of multiple
    international conferences for law enforcement on computer evidence, and by 1995,
    the International Organization of Computer Evidence (IOCE) was formed and began
    making recommendations for standards. The concept of “computer crime” had become
    a reality, not just in the United States, but internationally. In 1999, the Association
    of Chief Police Officers created a good practice guide for United Kingdom law
    enforcement handling computer-based evidence. Also during the late 1990s, the
    first open source forensic software, The Coroner’s Toolkit, was created by Dan
    Farmer and Wietse Venema. This software has evolved into today’s Sleuthkit.

    forensics. The tragedy of September 11, 2001 had a tremendous effect on how the
    world viewed security and incident response. The Enron and Arthur Andersen accounting
    scandals led to the creation of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act in the United States, designed
    to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures.
    This act required organizations to have formal incident response and investigation
    processes, typically including some form of digital forensics or evidence collection
    capability. The growth of intellectual property concerns also had an impact on
    civilian organizations. Internet fraud, phishing, and other intellectual property
    and brand-related incidents created further demand for investigation and evidence
    gathering. Peer-to-peer file sharing (starting with Napster), along with the arrival
    of digital copyright legislation in the form of the Digital Millennium Copyright
    Act, led to increased demand for investigating digital copyright violation.

    In some cases, only cached copies of data might remain on end-user devices, with
    the bulk of the data residing with cloud service providers. The interaction between
    a client/user and a cloud provider will involve metadata such as access or netflow
    logs. Collecting this data can be complicated for law enforcement if it resides
    outside their legal jurisdiction and difficult for private organizations when
    outsourced cloud providers have no forensic support provisions in their service
    contract.

    as well. The wide variety of little internet-enabled electronic gadgets (health
    monitors, clocks, displays, security cameras, and so on) typically don’t contain
    large amounts of storage, but they might contain useful telemetry data, such as
    timestamps, location and movement data, environmental conditions, and so forth.

    are the trend toward proprietary, locked-down devices and the use of encryption.
    Personal computer architectures and disk devices have historically been open and
    well documented, allowing for the creation of standard forensic tools to access
    the data. However, the increased use of proprietary software and hardware together
    with encrypted data makes forensic tool development difficult. This is especially
    problematic in the mobile device space where devices may need to be “jailbroken”
    (effectively hacked into) before lower-level filesystem block access is possible.

    infrastructure via an outsourcing partner in country D, and exfiltrates the stolen
    data to a drop zone in country E. In this scenario, five different countries are
    involved, meaning the potential coordination of five different law enforcement
    agencies and the engagement of at least five different companies across five different
    legal jurisdictions. This multiple-country scenario is not unusual today. In fact,

    to combat criminal activity in public–private partnerships. This multifaceted
    cooperation creates opportunities to identify, collect, and transfer digital evidence.
    The challenge is ensuring that private partners understand the nature of digital

    analyzing problems and gaining insight into new criminal methods. In some cases,

    activity on a hard drive (irreversibly deleting cache, history, temporary files,

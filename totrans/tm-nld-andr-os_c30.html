<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">F</span>rom the beginning, Android had a culture that was very distinct from the rest of Google. Even though the tiny Android startup was absorbed into the much larger company, Andy went out of his way to keep the team separate.</p>
<p>Jason Parks said, “Andy and the leadership team realized for this to succeed we needed to be separate from the larger Google culture and come up with our own culture to make this happen. I don’t know how he sold it to Eric, Larry, and Sergey, but he got it done. We were isolated and operated like a small startup, with funding from Google.”</p>
<p>Mike Cleron said that Andy keeping the team intentionally apart from the rest of the company “gave the team breathing room without having to constantly report in to big-G Google to do things.”</p>
<p>Not everyone on the team agreed with this approach. Mike Fleming said, “Android was walled off from Google. That was really a top-down decision. I remember feeling that that wasn’t a good idea and feeling opposed to that idea. I really wanted us to connect and build bridges and participate in Google culture. That really didn’t happen.”</p>
<p>The siloing of Android manifested itself in many ways, including keeping the project secret within the company and not participating in larger discussions and company meetings, which the team felt would have bogged things down.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_280" title="280"/>All of these dynamics helped keep the team focused on the single goal of shipping every release. But much like the physical separation of Australia from the rest of the world’s continents resulted in bizarre subspecies, Android developed a culture that was different, and a bit more reckless, than that of its larger, steadier, corporate parent.</p>
<p>Brian Jones commented on the Android culture and the singularity of mission that it endowed on the team. “We were a little startup within Google. We were shielded from the rest of the big company. We were this little enclave, and we had a lot of autonomy. Once you were in, everybody knew that you were on board towards that mission.</p>
<p>“We can have colorful, passionate arguments about what an implementation detail is, or what technical approach is needed to get there. But nobody in those early years ever doubted that anybody else was not in for the cause. We were all on the same train.”</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c30-0001">Web vs. Mobile</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">One of the things that kept Android separate from the rest of Google was that it was a fundamentally different product from what everyone else at Google worked on. Google, at the time, developed primarily web applications. This resulted in two important implications with respect to Android: unhappiness within Google that Android was not web-based, and incomprehension of the timeframe realities of mobile software.</p>
<p>First, there was a core distrust of what Android was doing because Google was fundamentally about web technologies. So much was possible using the web at that time; why wasn’t Android based around web technologies instead? The fact that other mobile platforms at the time (including Palm’s WebOS and even the iPhone, where Apple’s original plan for external developers was web apps) were using web technologies bolstered this argument. Yet Android stubbornly refused to go in that direction.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c30-footnote-2" id="c30-footnoteref-2">2</a></sup> It offered the ability to integrate web content in native applications (through <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_281" title="281"/>WebView, as well as offering a complete browser app), but applications were expected to be built with native (not web) technology, including a different language, different APIs, and overall different approach than web apps.</p>
<p>Second, Android was trying to ship a fundamentally different kind of product from the web app products that Google was used to writing. If you want to ship a new version of Search, you could do it this afternoon. And if there’s a bug in that version, you could fix it and update the app later tonight. Web products tend to have regular releases every few weeks, and teams launch and iterate constantly. But Android had very different constraints that made that approach and that mindset unworkable.</p>
<p>Brian Jones explained: “In Android, there’s a hardware component, there’s a manufacturing component, there’s a carrier component, there are partnerships. You can launch and iterate a search algorithm. You can’t launch and iterate a piece of hardware. You have to set a date and work backwards.”</p>
<p>Brian Swetland agreed: “The reality is, when you’re trying to ship consumer electronics, and somebody’s committing a factory line, or they’re lining up a big marketing campaign to hit their sales targets, you can’t miss or you really mess up things for your partners. You get a little crazy when you’re trying to hit those deadlines, because the consequences if you miss the window . . . you might not be able to ship that product three months later. You might <em>never</em> be able to ship that product, because now you have to build a whole different product.”</p>
<p>Swetland compared this approach to that of Google teams outside of Android: “It’s all web stuff: you ship it, and if it doesn’t work, you roll it back. It’s not quite as easy when you’re burning images at the factory.”<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c30-footnote-3" id="c30-footnoteref-3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Chiu-Ki Chan, who had transferred onto the Android team from elsewhere in Google, talked about this hardware-driven dynamic: “Android was the first team that taught me that Christmas ends in October. If you want your device to hit the market for Christmas, everything has to be done by October. It was such crazy deadlines because boards<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c30-footnote-4" id="c30-footnoteref-4">4</a></sup> had to be finalized. It <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_282" title="282"/>was the first time that I had real deadlines that could not be missed. Christmas doesn’t wait for anyone and boards can only be printed so fast, so you cannot miss the October deadline.”</p>
<p>This date-driven mentality ended up creating the hard-working, deadline-driven culture that defined Android in those early days.</p>

Programmers end up injecting a lot of software jargon in our regular speech, maybe because we assume that everyone we talk to speaks the same language. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy as people who don’t understand just stop listening.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c30-footnoteref-2" id="c30-footnote-2">2.</a></sup>  While the web held a lot of promise at that time, it lacked some of the capabilities, performance, and ability to run under very tight constraints that were considered critical in mobile at that time. Note that although Apple attempted to go in this direction, they also ended up with native applications for their App Store. Palm tried really hard with WebOS, but that didn’t succeed either. The promise of web technology as a general solution for mobile devices has yet to be realized many years later.</p></aside>

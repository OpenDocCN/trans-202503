<p class="noindent">This chapter will show you how to create sound with electronic components! Unlike other projects you’ve built so far, this chapter’s projects use an <em>integrated circuit (IC)</em>, which is a whole circuit that’s been shrunk down and packaged inside a tiny box. All sorts of circuits can be built as ICs, and most household devices are full of them. Peek inside a computer or an electronic toy, and you’re sure to find a few.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_162"/>To start, I’ll explain what an IC is in more detail and describe how to figure out what a particular IC does. Then, you’ll get some practice with ICs by building a simple circuit that makes some strange noises. At the end of the chapter, I’ll show you how to build your very own electronic instrument that you can use to play music!</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch08lev1sec01"><span class="green">MEET THE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">ICs are really small circuits that are conveniently packaged into little plastic boxes, which are often colored black. Any given IC has metal <em>pins</em> sticking out of it so you can connect other components to the circuit inside.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0162-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">On the inside, an IC might contain a music player circuit, a radio circuit, a remote control circuit, or something else entirely. Because one little IC can contain a very complicated circuit, you can use ICs to make circuits with many different functions without building everything from scratch.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch08lev1sec02"><span class="green">ICS AND DATASHEETS</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Some ICs have only 8 pins, but other ICs have more than 100! To figure out what each pin on a specific IC does, you need to check that IC’s datasheet, just as you did with the relay in “<a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05lev1sec05">Project #11: Blink a Light!</a>” on <a href="ch05.xhtml#page_101">page 101</a>. The datasheet <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_163"/>tells you the function of each pin, and datasheets often show examples of how to use ICs in a circuit, too. To find a component’s datasheet, try searching for the component name plus the term “datasheet” online, or check the website where you bought the component.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Datasheets often have tables with lots of numbers and technical terms, so the first time you see a datasheet for an IC, it might look very complex. But you usually don’t need to read the whole datasheet. Instead, you can just look up the information you need and then go back to building your circuit.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch08lev1sec03"><span class="green">HOW TO MAKE SOUND WITH ELECTRICITY</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><em>Sound</em> is what you hear when air moves back and forth, or <em>vibrates</em>, really fast. Many devices that make noises, like the sound system in a car, do so with a <em>loudspeaker</em>, a component that vibrates air fast enough to make sound.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0163-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">A loudspeaker has an electromagnet inside that moves a <em>diaphragm</em>, which is a surface that pushes the air in front of it. If a circuit turns the power to the loudspeaker’s electromagnet on and off at, say, 1,000 times per second, then the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_164"/>diaphragm pushes the air back and forth 1,000 times per second. This is called the <em>frequency</em> of the sound, and frequency is measured in hertz (Hz). A frequency of 1,000 times per second, or 1,000 Hz, creates a steady beep.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch08lev1sec04"><span class="green">SOUNDS THAT HUMANS CAN HEAR</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Humans can hear sound only from around 20 Hz up to around 20,000 Hz. In “<a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05lev1sec05">Project #11: Blink a Light!</a>” on <a href="ch05.xhtml#page_101">page 101</a>, you built a circuit that blinked a light about once per second. If you had connected the output of the circuit to a speaker instead, the sound from the speaker would have a frequency of 1 Hz, which would be too low to hear. Instead, you would hear clicks from the speaker as it was switched on and off.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This means that to create sound you can hear, you need to create a circuit that can turn the voltage to a speaker on and off hundreds or thousands of times per second! Fortunately, there’s an IC that can help you do just that.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch08lev1sec05"><span class="green">MEET THE 555 TIMER</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">One classic IC is the <em>555 timer</em>, which you can use to switch things rapidly on and off. For example, you could use a 555 timer to blink a light every second, or you could connect it to a loudspeaker to make sound. Along with the 555 timer, you’d need to add a few extra resistors and capacitors, and by carefully selecting the values of those components, you could control how fast the light blinks or the sound’s frequency. The 555 timer is very popular with hobbyists because it’s cheap and pretty easy to use once you learn the basics. You’ll use a 555 timer IC like the one shown here for the projects in this chapter.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0164-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec01"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_165"/><span class="green">Powering an IC</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The datasheet for the 555 timer should tell you what each pin does. Try searching online for “555 timer datasheet” now. When you find the datasheet and open it, you should see a <em>pinout</em> like this:</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0165-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indentb">The 555 timer has eight pins. The pins of an IC are numbered counterclockwise, starting from the top left. (The top is indicated by a little notch or circle; some ICs have both.) The datasheet tells you the functions of each of the eight pins, but the following two pins are the most important to notice right now:</p>&#13;
<p class="noindenth"><strong>Pin 1, ground</strong>   This pin must be connected to the negative terminal of your battery. Circuit diagrams that use ICs often label the negative battery terminal in a circuit schematic “ground,” or GND for short.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindenth"><strong>Pin 8, V</strong><sub>CC</sub>   This pin must be connected to the positive side of your battery, which must be at a voltage between 4.5 and 15 V. This means that a 9 V battery will work fine. On some ICs, this pin is called V<sub>DD</sub> instead.</p>&#13;
<p class="indentt">You’ll find V<sub>CC</sub> and ground pins on all ICs. They’re the first pins to learn from any datasheet because you’ll use them to power the circuit inside the IC.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The datasheet also shows how to connect the 555 timer in a circuit, and the circuit I find the most interesting connects the 555 timer in <em>astable mode</em>. <em>Astable</em> means that something is continually changing (not stable), and in astable mode, a 555 <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_166"/>timer switches its output on and off constantly. That’s perfect to blink a light or to create sound! Here’s the circuit that tells the 555 timer to turn its output on and off:</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0166-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="red">NOTE</span></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>The positions of the 555 pins have been arranged to suit the diagram; they’re not in the same order as on the IC.</em></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec02"><span class="green">How to Set the Output Speed of the 555 Timer</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The values of R1, R2, and C1 in the circuit diagram determine how long the output pin stays <em>high</em>—meaning it outputs a voltage close to the battery voltage—and how long it stays <em>low</em>—meaning it outputs a voltage close to 0 V. The speed of the change in output, or the frequency, is the number of times the output goes from high to low in one second. When the 555 timer is connected in astable mode, as it is in the circuit diagram, the frequency of the output is controlled by resistors R1 and R2 and capacitor C1 according to the following formula:</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0166-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_167"/>Here, the resistor values are in ohms, and the capacitance is in farads. To find the frequency, first replace R1, R2, and C1 in the formula with the values of these parts and then punch the stuff on the right side of the equal sign into a calculator.</p>&#13;
<p class="indentb">Let’s try an example. Imagine a circuit with the following component values:</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> R1 = 100 kΩ</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> R2 = 10 kΩ</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> C1 = 10 nF</p>&#13;
<p class="indentt">What is the frequency of the output? Enter these values into the formula:</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0167-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now convert the units so the values are easier to multiply (120 kΩ = 120,000 Ω and 10 nF = 0.00000001 F):</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0167-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">According to this calculation, the output should turn on and off 1,200 times per second with those values.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch08lev1sec06"><span class="black1">PROJECT #16: MAKE YOUR OWN SOUND WITH THE 555 TIMER</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This project will show you how to play a sound with a frequency of about 1,200 Hz through a speaker. That’s pretty cool! But a 1,200 Hz sound isn’t very pleasant to listen to, and if you have any pets, they might appreciate the sound even less than you. In fact, when I turned on this circuit at <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_168"/>my parents’ home, their dog came running to me looking very confused and a bit scared. I turned it off quickly and moved my experiments to a place with no pets around, and I suggest not building this project around your pets, either.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec04"><span class="green">Step 1: Place the 555 Timer on the Breadboard</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This circuit is built around the 555 timer IC, so first, place that IC in the middle of the breadboard, making it easy to connect all the components around it.</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="red">NOTE</span></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>When connecting an IC to a breadboard, always place it over the middle notch, with one set of pins on the left side and the other on the right side. Otherwise, any pins that share a row on the breadboard will be connected to each other.</em></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Place the IC’s notch marker toward the top of the board so that pin 1 is at the upper-left corner and pin 8 is at the upper-right corner, as shown. Triple-check that you’ve oriented the chip as I describe; otherwise, the rest of the instructions in this project won’t work.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0170-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec05"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_171"/><span class="green">Step 2: Set the Frequency</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Next, connect the resistors and capacitor that set the frequency: R1, R2, and C1. The C1 capacitor isn’t polarized, so it doesn’t matter which way you connect it. Use the two vertical columns on the right for positive and negative: the red column for positive and the other for negative.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Connect R1, the 100 kΩ resistor, from pin 7 of the 555 timer to the positive column. Connect R2, the 10 kΩ resistor, from pin 6 to pin 7. And connect C1, the 10 nF capacitor, from pin 6 to the negative column. Then, connect a jumper wire from pin 2 to pin 6 to complete the rest of the connections that are needed to set the frequency.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0171-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec06"><span class="green">Step 3: Connect the Speaker and Coupling Capacitor</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">All the components to make the 555 timer output pin 3 turn on and off around 1,000 times per second should be in place on your breadboard now. If you were to connect the speaker directly to the output, a large current would flow through the speaker, possibly damaging both the speaker and the 555 IC. You could connect the speaker through a resistor to reduce the current, but using a capacitor is even better. When a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_172"/>capacitor is connected to an AC voltage, the capacitor acts a bit like a resistor, but if you connect it to a constant DC voltage, the current will be blocked. This means that there won’t be any current running through the speaker unless there’s actually a frequency to be played. When a capacitor is used like this, it’s called a <em>coupling capacitor</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The coupling capacitor for this project is a 10 μF polarized capacitor, so first identify which leg is negative. Connect the positive capacitor leg to the 555 timer’s output pin 3. Then connect the capacitor’s negative leg to an empty row on your breadboard.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0172-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Next, if your speaker comes without wires, solder a wire about 6 inches long to each of the two contacts on the back of the speaker (ignore any + or – labels by the speaker contacts). Then, connect one of the speaker wires to the same row as the negative capacitor leg and the other wire to the negative supply column.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0172-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec07"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_173"/><span class="green">Step 4: Connect the Power and Reset Pins</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindentb">Compare your breadboard to the circuit diagram at the beginning of the project, and you’ll see that there are a few connections missing. Once you have all of your components in place on the breadboard, you can make those final connections with jumper wires. Add a jumper wire for each of the following connections:</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> From pin 1 on the 555 timer to the negative supply column</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> From pin 8 on the 555 timer to the positive supply column</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> From pin 4 on the 555 timer to the positive supply column</p>&#13;
<p class="indentt">Note that there’s no connection to pin 5 of the 555 timer in this circuit.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec08"><span class="green">Step 5: Make Some Sound!</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Connect the battery clip to your supply columns on the right side of the breadboard. The red wire goes to the positive supply column, and the black wire goes to the negative supply column.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0173-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">When you’re ready, connect the battery, and you should hear a loud beep. Congratulations: You just made your first electronic sound!</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec09"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_174"/><span class="green">Step 6: What If There’s No Sound?</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">There are a lot of connections in this circuit, so if your circuit doesn’t work on your first attempt, don’t worry: that happens to everyone who plays with electronics at some point. First, disconnect the battery, and then check the resistor and capacitor legs. These legs are long, and they can easily end up in contact with each other by accident, creating a short circuit. (For example, if you accidentally connect the positive terminal of the battery directly to the negative terminal, that short-circuits the battery.)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Next, check the component connections to the 555 timer. The 555 timer’s pins must connect to the rest of the circuit according to the circuit diagram, or the IC won’t work. When there are a lot of connections, it’s easy to plug a wire into the wrong row of the breadboard.</p>&#13;
<div class="sidebar1">&#13;
<p class="sidebart1" id="ch08sb01"><strong>CHECKING CONNECTIONS AS A TEAM</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindentb">Finding circuit problems is called <em>debugging</em>, and it’s easier to do with some help. When you get stuck, ask someone else to look at the circuit diagram and say the connections out loud one by one while you check the real connections. For example, if your friend is reading the schematic and you’re looking at the breadboard, you might have a conversation like this:</p>&#13;
<p class="noindenthi">Friend: “The positive side of the battery is connected to one side of R1.”</p>&#13;
<p class="noindenthi">You: “Got it!”</p>&#13;
<p class="noindenthi">Friend: “The positive side of the battery is also connected to pins 4 and 8 of the IC.”</p>&#13;
<p class="noindenthi">You: “Got it!”</p>&#13;
<p class="noindenthi">Friend: “The other side of R1 is connected to pin 7 of the chip and to one side of the resistor R2.”</p>&#13;
<p class="noindenthi">You: “Oh, wait! I don’t have the connection to pin 7!”</p>&#13;
<p class="indentt">And just like that, you’ll discover the problem.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_175"/>If all your components appear to be oriented correctly and you see no short circuits, then check all your breadboard connections to make sure components that should be connected share a row. Start with the connection from the positive terminal of the battery on your circuit diagram. Is it connected on the board just as the circuit diagram shows? If yes, then move on to the next connection; keep going like this until you’ve checked all the connections.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch08lev1sec07"><span class="green">TURNING AN ANNOYING BEEP INTO MUSIC</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The sound you created in the previous project isn’t very pleasant. So how can you turn it into music? Musical notes are just sound waves that vibrate at specific frequencies, and that means it’s possible to make an electronic instrument with the 555 timer. If you change the frequency of the signal that goes into the speaker, then the tone of the sound will change. You just have to find a way to change the 555 timer’s output frequency at will, without rebuilding the circuit every time.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07">Chapter 7</a> introduced two components that can change their resistance value: the potentiometer and the photoresistor. If you use one of those components to control the frequency of the 555 timer’s output signal, then when that component’s resistance changes, the sound will change, too. That’s how you’ll make the instrument in the next project.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch08lev1sec08"><span class="black1">PROJECT #17: AN INSTRUMENT THAT BEEPS AND BOOPS</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This project shows you how to combine what you’ve learned so far to build your very own electronic instrument. Specifically, you’re going to build an instrument with a button to play sound and a potentiometer shaft to change the tone.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This instrument is like a very simple <em>synthesizer</em> that uses electricity to make sounds. Synthesizers have been used to add all kinds of bleeps, bloops, and glitchy sounds to songs since the beginning of the electronic music genre. This one is pretty basic, but it still makes plenty of fun noises. In fact, the circuit for this project looks very similar to the circuit <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_176"/>from “<a href="ch08.xhtml#ch08lev1sec06">Project #16: Make Your Own Sound with the 555 Timer</a>” on <a href="ch08.xhtml#page_167">page 167</a>, but it has a few twists.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This circuit replaces the separate R1 and R2, which the circuits in Project #16 used, with a potentiometer (and a protective 1 kΩ resistor). The potentiometer acts like two resistors, meaning that you can effectively change the values of R1 and R2 whenever you want to change the tone you hear.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notice that this circuit also has a switch connected to the positive battery terminal. This switch is a push button, and with a switch between power and your circuit, the instrument should make a sound only when you push the button.</p>&#13;

And connect C2, the 10µF capacitor, with its positive leg at pin 3 of the chip and the negative leg on an empty row farther down. When you’re done, your board should look something like this:</p>&#13;

<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec12"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_179"/><span class="green">Step 2: Connect Jumper Wires</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindentb">Use jumper wires to create the following connections:</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> Pin 8 to the breadboard’s positive supply column</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> Pin 4 to the breadboard’s positive supply column</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> Pin 1 to the breadboard’s negative supply column</p>&#13;
<p class="arrow"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/> Pin 2 to pin 6</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0179-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec13"><span class="green">Step 3: Connect the Note Controller and Resistor</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Next up is the potentiometer, which controls the note that plays. Because it takes up more space, plug this in at the bottom of the breadboard, as shown, and be sure each leg is in its own row.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Connect the 1 kΩ resistor from the uppermost leg of the potentiometer to an unused row away from the 555 IC and connect a jumper wire from this row to the positive supply. Then, connect one jumper wire to each of the two remaining <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_180"/>potentiometer legs. Connect the wire on the middle potentiometer leg to pin 7 on the 555 timer, and connect the wire on the lower leg to pin 6 on the 555 timer.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0180-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec14"><span class="green">Step 4: Add the “On” Button</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You’re almost done! Instead of wiring the battery clip directly to the positive supply column on the breadboard, you’re going to connect it through a push button, which will act as an “on” button for your instrument. This way, the circuit will get power from the battery only when the button is pushed and, therefore, make sound only when you push the button.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The push button in the Shopping List (<a href="ch08.xhtml#page_177">page 177</a>) has four pins, but the two legs in the front are connected and the two pins in the back are connected. That means this button works exactly like a two-pin switch. When you push the button, you connect the front pair of pins with the back pair. Your circuit will get power and you’ll hear the sound. When you release the button, the circuit loses power again and the sound will stop.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0180-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_181"/>Plug the push button into your breadboard over the notch in the middle. Then, use a jumper wire to connect one side of the push button to the breadboard’s positive supply column. Next, connect the positive wire from your battery clip to the other side of the push button. Finally, connect the negative battery clip wire to the negative supply column.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0181-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec15"><span class="green">Step 5: Add the Loudspeaker</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Connect one of the speaker wires to the same row as the negative capacitor leg and the other wire to the negative supply column.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec16"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_182"/><span class="green">Step 6: Play Some Music!</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Connect your battery to the battery clip and push the button. Did you hear a sound? Try turning the potentiometer spindle back and forth until you hear something.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can make a beat by pushing the button in any rhythm you like, and you can control the tone by turning the shaft of the potentiometer in between. Beep, baap, booop!</p>&#13;

<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec17"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_183"/><span class="green">Step 7: What If the Instrument Doesn’t Work?</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Some potentiometers aren’t perfectly fitted for breadboards, so start by checking whether your potentiometer is properly connected to the breadboard. Next, check that the two capacitors and the push button are connected according to the circuit diagram at the beginning of the project.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">There are a lot of wires on this board, so it’s easy to mix up connections. If you still aren’t able to hear any sound, then go through all the connections on your board and check that they’re correct. I suggest using the process I described in “<a href="ch08.xhtml#ch08sb01">Checking Connections as a Team</a>” on <a href="ch08.xhtml#page_174">page 174</a>.</p>&#13;

<p class="sidebart1" id="ch08sb02"><strong>TRY IT OUT: MAKE A MOTION-CONTROLLED INSTRUMENT</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Instead of replacing both R1 and R2 with a potentiometer, try using a 1 kΩ resistor for R1 and a photoresistor for R2, as shown in this circuit diagram. As you move your hand over the photoresistor, the amount of light hitting it should change, and the instrument should play different notes!</p>&#13;

<p class="noindent">There are millions of integrated circuits in the world, and they do all kinds of awesome things. Remember, whenever you want to use an IC in your projects, you can use its datasheet to find out both what the IC does and what kind of circuit you need to make it work.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In this chapter, you learned how to use a 555 timer IC to make music. These circuits had lots of connections, so if you didn’t get them right the first time, then you’re in good company. Most people mix up wires the first time they connect a circuit, and fixing the connections is great practice! And speaking of practice, now would be a good time to do some more soldering. Why not solder your instrument on to a prototyping board—and maybe even put it in a box?</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Integrated circuits are very commonly used in <em>digital circuits</em>. Digital circuits can do many things simply by switching the right parts on and off, often very rapidly, just as in the musical instrument you made in this chapter. Modern gadgets like your computer use digital circuits, and you’ll learn more about digital electronics in the last few chapters of this book.</p>&#13;

- en: '**Ya√© Ulrich Gaba** completed his doctoral studies at the University of Cape
    Town (UCT, South Africa) with a specialization in topology and is currently a
    research associate at Quantum Leap Africa (QLA, Rwanda). His research interests
    are computational geometry, applied algebraic topology (topological data analysis),
    and geometric machine learning (graph and point-cloud representation learning).
    His current focus lies in geometric methods in data analysis, and his work seeks
    to develop effective and theoretically justified algorithms for data and shape
    analysis using geometric and topological ideas and methods.'

- en: '**Franck Kalala Mutombo** is a professor of mathematics at Lubumbashi University
    and the former academic director of AIMS Senegal. He previously worked in a research
    position at University of Strathclyde and at AIMS South Africa in a joint appointment
    with the University of Cape Town. He holds a PhD in mathematical sciences from
    the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland. He is an expert in the study
    and analysis of complex network structure and applications. His most recent research
    considers the impact of network structure on long-range interactions applied to
    epidemics, diffusion, and object clustering. His other research interests include
    differential geometry of manifolds, finite element methods for partial differential
    equations, and data science.'

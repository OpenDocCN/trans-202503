    respiratory diseases, but the quality of the lessons wasn’t always up to snuff.
    In March of 2020, in a now-deleted tweet, the US Surgeon General scolded Americans
    who were buying N95 respirators, proclaiming that the masks weren’t effective
    in preventing the spread of respiratory diseases—and that wearing one may even
    somehow leave you worse off.^([1](b02.xhtml#c21-endnote-1)) The early advice from

    Confusingly, many health authorities prohibited the use of common N95 respirators
    with exhalation valves, even though they almost certainly did more to protect
    the populace than a piece of cotton with ear loops. Other poorly substantiated
    promulgations followed: California designated recreational marijuana dispensaries
    as essential businesses and advised people to sing or chant only “below the volume
    of a normal speaking voice,”^([3](b02.xhtml#c21-endnote-3)) while in Michigan,
    big box stores were allowed to stay open, but only if they cordoned off the sections

    The leadership failures in Washington, DC, mounted for years, too, culminating
    in a dizzying display of finger-pointing, wishful thinking, and outright denial.
    The most painful lesson of the pandemic is that the science in the news isn’t

    clear and objective criteria for any potentially disruptive actions is important

    For one, we tend to touch our faces quite a bit, and from there, viruses and bacteria
    can make it onto mucous membranes through the mouth, eyes, or nose. Frequent handwashing,
    a good idea even when there isn’t a pandemic going on, curbs the spread of mundane
    but annoying diseases such as norovirus or pinworms too. When handwashing isn’t

    the likelihood of tracking the pathogen all over the place. Positive-pressure

    playbook. Some of the simplest control techniques include window screens, bed
    nets, head nets, and the removal of breeding grounds such as stagnant water around
    the home. Insecticides can work wonders too. One popular choice is deltamethrin,
    a long-lasting synthetic compound derived from pyrethrin, a natural substance
    produced by chrysanthemums. This extremely potent neurotoxin for insects is poorly
    absorbed and rapidly metabolized in most mammals, thus posing relatively little
    risk if used properly. Other modern insecticides include a family of tobacco-derived
    neonicotinoids such as imidacloprid, a bacteria-produced bug neurotoxin known
    as spinosad, and insect hormone look-alikes such as (S)-hydroprene or pyriproxyfen.
    That last category doesn’t kill on contact; instead, the substances—also known
    as *insect growth regulators*—disrupt the normal life cycle of a bug, for example
    by preventing it from progressing past the larval stage.

    fairly safe compared to their predecessors from 50 years ago, they certainly aren’t

    whereas a mechanical trap needs to be reset after every kill; this can matter
    for vacation homes or for some hard-to-reach spots. On the flip side, the poisons
    can be dangerous to dogs and small children, so they shouldn’t be placed within
    easy reach—not unless contained in a tamper-proof bait station of some sort. A

<p class="h1-title"><strong>ADVANCED DEVICE SECURITY CONCEPTS</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Many managers and developers dream of one-shot security solutions. They believe that a secure device results from <em>just activating</em> a protection feature in the OS kernel or by <em>just integrating</em> a security component into the PCB design of the product. Clearly, thatâ€™s wishful thinking. Engineering secure devices requires focus and attention from development to device production to daily operation.</p>
<p class="indent">The third part of this book covers concepts that can have a strong impact on device security, like system integrity, reliable update procedures, and robustness even under attack. Further, intelligent access control management and system monitoring can significantly reduce the impact of vulnerabilities. However, all of these succeed only if considered and implemented comprehensively.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_140"/></p>

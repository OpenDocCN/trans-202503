<p class="PCO">The next three chapters outline numerous examples of tabletop exercise scenarios that you can personalize to fit your organization. For each example, weâ€™ll provide a storyboard with injects and discussion questions. Keep in mind that these should serve only as inspiration for your tabletop exercise; you should modify these scenarios as needed to fit your environment and the goals and objectives of your exercise.</p>&#13;

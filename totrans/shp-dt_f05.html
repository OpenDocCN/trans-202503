<p class="BodyFirst"><b>Colleen M. Farrelly</b> is a senior data scientist whose academic and industry research has focused on topological data analysis, quantum machine learning, geometry-based machine learning, network science, hierarchical modeling, and natural language processing. Since graduating from the University of Miami with an MS in biostatistics, Colleen has worked as a data scientist in a variety of industries, including healthcare, consumer packaged goods, biotech, nuclear engineering, marketing, and education. Colleen often speaks at tech conferences, including PyData, SAS Global, WiDS, Data Science Africa, and DataScience SALON. When not working, Colleen can be found writing haibun/haiga or swimming.</p>
<p class="BodyFirst"><b>Ya√© Ulrich Gaba</b> completed his doctoral studies at the University of Cape Town (UCT, South Africa) with a specialization in topology and is currently a research associate at Quantum Leap Africa (QLA, Rwanda). His research interests are computational geometry, applied algebraic topology (topological data analysis), and geometric machine learning (graph and point-cloud representation learning). His current focus lies in geometric methods in data analysis, and his work seeks to develop effective and theoretically justified algorithms for data and shape analysis using geometric and topological ideas and methods.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst"><b>Franck Kalala Mutombo</b> is a professor of mathematics at Lubumbashi University and the former academic director of AIMS Senegal. He previously worked in a research position at University of Strathclyde and at AIMS South Africa in a joint appointment with the University of Cape Town. He holds a PhD in mathematical sciences from the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland. He is an expert in the study and analysis of complex network structure and applications. His most recent research considers the impact of network structure on long-range interactions applied to epidemics, diffusion, and object clustering. His other research interests include differential geometry of manifolds, finite element methods for partial differential equations, and data science.</p>

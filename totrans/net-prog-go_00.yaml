    and developers. Today, personal computers, tablets, phones, televisions, watches,
    gaming systems, vehicles, common household items, and even doorbells communicate
    over the internet. Network programming makes all this possible. And *secure* network
    programming makes it trustworthy, driving increasing numbers of people to adopt
    these services. This book will teach you how to write contemporary network software
    using Go’s asynchronous features.

    of developers working with large code bases. Since then, Go has earned a reputation
    as a fast, efficient, and safe language for the development and deployment of
    software at some of the largest companies in the world. Go is easy to learn and
    has a rich standard library, well suited for taking advantage of multicore, networked
    systems.

    You will learn socket-level programming including TCP, UDP, and Unix sockets,
    interact with application-level protocols like HTTPS and HTTP/2, serialize data
    with formats like Gob, JSON, XML, and protocol buffers, perform authentication
    and authorization for your network services, create streams and asynchronous data
    transfers, write gRPC microservices, perform structured logging and instrumentation,
    and deploy your applications to the cloud.

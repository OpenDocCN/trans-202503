<h2 class="h2" id="ch24"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_193"/>—24—<br/>Priority Queues for Investigations</h2>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Captain Donavan,” Notation blurted as she came into the office. “I’d like to personally apologize for conducting an unauthorized investigation outside of working hours. But this is <em>my</em> investigation as much as Frank’s, and if he’s briefing—”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“And how exactly did it become <em>your</em> investigation, Officer Notation?” interrupted the captain. “I thought I had assigned you to the counterfeit yo-yo case. Why were you at Crannock’s farm investigating stolen papers?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I was following a lead—” started Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“You were following a lead?” interrupted the captain. “I didn’t see anything about an ArrayCart in any of your reports.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“It occurred to me that morning,” explained Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“You decided to pursue this lead instead of reporting it to the detective in charge of the investigation?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank winced. The captain was obsessed with following the correct protocol for an investigation. On the captain’s personal list of horrendous violations, the failure to report a lead ranked somewhere above the use of heuristic data structures and right under the refusal to shower. From Notation’s near-panicked expression, he could tell she was thinking the same thing.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_194"/>“I was already near the farm,” she said. “And—”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“What was the lead?” asked Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notation turned to him in surprise, either horror-struck that he’d interrupted the captain’s interrogation or because she’d simply forgotten he was there.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I remembered something from the night of the theft,” she said. “I’d just finished my nightly report when I saw an odd cart out the window. I didn’t think anything of it at the time, because the fishmongers are always using strange carts. I figured it was the morning eel delivery.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">She turned to the captain, her eyes pleading. “It seemed like such a long shot,” she explained. “I figured it would be a dead end, that the cart was just a delivery. I didn’t want to report it until I knew more.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“And then you joined Frank on the investigation for almost two full days,” said the captain.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“We’d found some promising leads,” offered Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Officer Notation,” the captain snapped. “I don’t care if you were being led by the ghost of a former police captain. Procedures exist for a reason. You didn’t follow them.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notation stared hard at the ground. “I understand, sir.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“No,” said the captain. “I’m not sure you do. But you’ll have plenty of time to think about it. You’re on desk duty until further notice.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notation shuddered, but didn’t protest.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The captain turned to Frank. “And you have work to do, Frank,” he said, ending the meeting.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As she turned to leave, Notation’s eyes fixed on the portrait of King Fredrick hanging on the wall. She seemed lost in thought for a moment.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Captain,” she said suddenly. “Do you have any priority queues?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank took a moment to make the connection, but finally dredged up the faint memory. One of his professors had droned on in class about how King Fredrick had popularized priority queues.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_195"/><img src="../images/f0195-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Before he’d become king, Fredrick held audience to hear the complaints and concerns of the kingdom’s citizens. Due to his tight schedule and the abundance of the citizenry’s complaints, he had been forced to develop a prioritization scheme. A prince could only be expected to endure so many complaints at a time.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">First Prince Fredrick had tried a complaint stack, hearing the most recent complaints first, but then he missed important older complaints. Then he tried a complaint queue, hearing the oldest complaints first, but then he missed important recent complaints. Finally, he’d employed a new data structure—the priority queue—which allowed him to hear the most important complaints first.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Priority queues?” asked the captain, clearly thrown off by the sudden question. Almost nobody dared speak following a lecture from the captain. They simply shuffled humbly out of the office or, in some cases, spent the next few hours huddled in a dark broom closet.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Data structures,” explained Notation, apparently on autopilot. “They’re like regular queues: you enqueue and dequeue items. But they also require each item to have a priority score—a measure of importance. When you dequeue an item, the priority queue always gives you the next most important item.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_196"/>Seeing blank stares from both the captain and Frank, Notation pressed on with an example. “If I inserted four items, with priorities 1, 2, 4, and 3, I would extract them in the order 4, 3, 2, 1.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I know what priority queues are,” said the captain. “We use them for storing the list of noise complaints. The louder noises get higher priority, so we are always addressing the worst cases first. I heard they use them for smell complaints near the sewage marshes as well. Although it seems like everything there would have an equally high priority—unbearable. But what’s your point?</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Do you have any?” Notation asked.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The captain shook his head, confusion still keeping his anger in check. “None to spare,” he said. “We’re using all of the priority queues we have—one for noise complaints, three for different types of crimes, one for the most wanted list, and one for vacation requests. Why?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Best-first search,” said Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Best-first search?” asked the Captain. “Frank told me that he was already using best-first search.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“That’s right,” confirmed Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“A priority queue would make it more efficient,” explained Notation. “Each time we find a new lead, we could put it into the priority queue with a score indicating how good a lead it is. Then, when we’re ready to explore the next lead, we take one off the priority queue. We’ll always get the next best lead.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank sighed and shook his head. He knew the captain well enough to see how this was going to go. The captain excelled at his own brand of teaching moments. He wouldn’t yell or curse, but would calmly lead a new officer into realizing their own stupidity. “How were you doing it before?” asked the captain in a patient tone. This was not going to end well.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I keep the leads in a notebook,” responded Notation. “Each time we’re ready to explore a new lead, I scan through the entire list of leads to find the best one.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_197"/>“And how many leads did you have?” asked the captain. “Let’s say on average.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“On average?” Notation thought about this for a moment. “Between two and five, I guess.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“You want me to use one of the department’s priority queues to help you scan through a list of two to five elements?” If the captain had used his customary growl, the question might have sounded less harsh. Instead, his calm patience made it excruciatingly clear how idiotic he found the whole discussion.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notation flushed. “Well, priority queues aren’t that expensive . . .” she started, but trailed off.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Look, Officer Notation,” said the captain. “I agree that priority queues are great for best-first search. After this meeting, I may order a whole new set, one for each detective. But you don’t need one right now. To start with, you don’t have enough leads. More importantly, <em>you aren’t even on this case</em>.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notation’s face had reddened progressively throughout the lecture, and it had now achieved the complexion of beet soup. She took a deep breath, looked the captain straight in the eye, and mumbled, “I understand, sir.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank felt a surge of pity. Notation had made a classic rookie mistake, overoptimizing the solution. He had to hand it to her—the idea of using priority queues for tracking leads was perfectly reasonable. In fact, he’d been using a priority queue this entire time. However, her timing on the question couldn’t have been worse.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Notation,” the captain continued, “you’ve got a lot of promise here. You’re bright, you’re driven, and you have good instincts. But you have to learn to follow orders. Don’t end up like Frank here.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notation opened her mouth as though to protest. Then she glanced at Frank, grimaced, and closed her mouth without a word of argument. She nodded curtly, snapped a salute, and strode from the office.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_198"/>“And you, Frank, have work to do. Get going.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank turned and followed Notation out, not bothering with even a nod.</p>&#13;
<p class="center">_____________________</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank waited until they had reached the stairs before speaking.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“You know . . . there’s a wizard in the Orb district that can make you an inexpensive priority queue. His name is Heaperous, actually. I think that’s how he got into data structures in the first place. With a name like Heaperous, I suppose it’s an inevitability. Anyway, the priority queue won’t be pretty, but it’ll work. He only works mornings, though, so you’ll have to wait ’til tomorrow.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notation stopped walking and gave him a suspicious look. “Why are you telling me this, Frank?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank forced his face into his best sympathetic look. “I’ve been on the receiving end of many of the captain’s speeches. And, more importantly, I know how valuable a good data structure can be during an investigation.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“If good data structures are so valuable, then why don’t <em>you</em> use a priority queue?” she shot back.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank shot her an irritated look. “Of course I use a priority queue. I’ve been using one since we started. Did you think I’ve been keeping all the clues in my head? I’m too old for that sort of thing.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“What?” exclaimed Notation. “You’ve been using a priority queue this whole time? Why didn’t you say anything to the captain?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank laughed at this. “You have a lot to learn about the captain, rookie. First off, you never interrupt him while he’s ranting about <em>anything</em>. I once saw a detective put on desk duty for a month because she derailed a rant about tofu. It wasn’t even a particularly good rant. He’d got stuck alternating between its squishy texture and its lack of taste.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notation stared at Frank, apparently at a loss for words.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_199"/>“The point is,” Frank continued, “sometimes you need to take matters into your own hands. If a priority queue will help you, don’t wait for the requisition process. Just go out and buy one.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notation considered this advice. Finally, she nodded. “I guess that buying my own equipment won’t technically violate any policies. Thank you, Frank.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The excitement on Notation’s face almost made Frank feel guilty. Any wizard shop in town could make a priority queue, and most would match Heaperous’s prices. But Heaperous’s shop in the Orb district was the farthest one still within city limits, and Frank needed to make sure Notation stayed out the way for a little while longer.</p>&#13;

<p class="sidebart"><strong>POLICE ALGORITHMS 101: PRIORITY QUEUES</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="sbsub"><em><strong>Excerpt from Professor Drecker’s Lecture</strong></em></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Of all the data structures you’ll encounter during your career in the police force, I guarantee that priority queues will be the most valuable. Like stacks and queues, priority queues are data structures that allow you to insert data and later remove it in a specific order. Where stacks and queues enforce orderings determined by when an element was inserted, priority queues order the data by decreasing priority. The next element removed is the highest-priority element in the queue, regardless of when it was inserted.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Each item inserted into a priority queue must also have a priority, or score. This could be the value of the element itself or a value computed by a different function.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_200"/>Consider this example of prioritizing noise complaints based on their severity. If you inserted the complaints in the following order:</p>&#13;
<div class="blockquote">&#13;
<p class="noindent">“The crowd at the Exponentiated Expresso” (score = 3)</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">“Crab’s Pinch sea shanty contest” (score = 6)</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">“Farmer Swinson’s rabbit” (score = 1)</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">“Farmer Swinson’s rooster” (score = 5)</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">“Farmer Swinson” (score = 7)</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">You would retrieve them from the priority queue as:</p>&#13;
<div class="blockquote">&#13;
<p class="noindent">“Farmer Swinson” (score = 7)</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">“Crab’s Pinch sea shanty contest” (score = 6)</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">“Farmer Swinson’s rooster” (score = 5)</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">“The crowd at the Exponentiated Expresso” (score = 3)</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">“Farmer Swinson’s rabbit” (score = 1)</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Note that there are no guarantees that the data will be sorted within the priority queue, only that it is extracted in order. As you’ll see in later lectures, data structures called <em>heaps</em> are an efficient way of implementing priority queues that do <em>not</em> keep the data in fully sorted order.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The capital’s station uses a variety of priority functions. As you might expect, the queue most hotly debated is the vacation priority queue. This queue is ordered solely by the officer’s number of unused vacation days. Despite previous requests, no additional priority is given for the niceness of the vacation spot. Upcoming trips to glaciers, beaches, and swamps are treated equally. Instead, the queue prioritizes based on one measure of fairness. It helps to ensure that the next officer to go on vacation is the one who’s taken the fewest vacation days this year.</p>&#13;

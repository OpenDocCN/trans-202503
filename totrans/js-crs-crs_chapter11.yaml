- en: In the previous chapter we built our own version of the game *Pong*. Earlier,
    in [Chapter 6](chapter6.xhtml), you learned about classes and object-oriented
    programming in JavaScript. You might be wondering why we didn’t use any classes
    for our implementation of *Pong*. The main reason was that I wanted to keep the
    game code as simple as possible, without including any unnecessary concepts, to
    make it easier to see what the actual game is doing. As programs get larger and
    more complex, however, it helps to give them more structure, and one common way
    to do that is to use object-oriented programming.

- en: To help you get a better understanding of how to design software in an object-oriented
    style, in this chapter we’ll walk through an object-oriented version of *Pong*.
    There won’t be any changes to the logic of the game, but the structure and organization
    of the code will be different. For example, the code for handling the ball will
    all live in a class called Ball. We’ll use this class to keep track of the ball’s
    position and to determine how the ball should bounce when it hits a wall or paddle.
    Similarly, all the code for handling the paddles will live in a class called Paddle.
    We’ll be able to easily share common code that applies to both balls and paddles
    by making the Ball and Paddle classes inherit from a shared superclass.

    instead of building up the game incrementally, in this chapter we’ll step through
    the full code in order, section by section. Because of that, the code won’t run
    correctly or really *do* anything until you’ve entered it all. But before we get

    organizing the code into classes representing the various aspects of the program.
    This structure makes it easier for other programmers (and even a later version
    of you) to understand how your code works. A complete treatment of object-oriented

- en: 'An important first step in object-oriented design is modeling your domain,
    or the world of your program. What are the different elements in the program,
    what do they need to be able to do, and how do they relate to and interact with
    each other? In this case, the domain is the game *Pong*, and there are several
    visible elements in the game: the ball, the paddles, and the scores. While there
    are two paddles, they mostly behave in the same way, so we can create a single
    Paddle class with two customized instances. Meanwhile, the ball is distinct enough
    to deserve its own class. We also have to model how these elements interact. For
    example, how do we model the ball colliding with a paddle? That code has to live
    somewhere. As you’ll see, in my design, I decided that the code should live in
    the Ball class. In other words, the ball should “know” how to bounce off the paddles
    and the walls when it collides with them.'
  id: totrans-9

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another important aspect of object-oriented programming is *encapsulation*.
    This means hiding the inner details of a class from the rest of the program, and
    providing a simple interface for it to use to interact with the class. Encapsulating
    these details makes it easier to change them later without affecting the rest
    of the program. For example, the Ball class doesn’t need to expose its speed or
    position to the rest of the program. If we decide to change how the speed is represented
    (for example, using angle and speed instead of xSpeed and ySpeed), we shouldn’t
    have to change how any other part of the program works.

    that if a method expects to receive objects of a certain class, then it can also
    receive objects that are instances of subclasses of that class. For example, in
    this chapter you’ll see an Entity class that has a draw method and two subclasses:
    Paddle and Ball. In keeping with polymorphism, any code that uses the draw method
    should be able to receive any kind of Entity as an argument, without caring about
    whether we pass it a Ball or a Paddle.'

    things. With that in mind, let’s dive into our object-oriented *Pong* code.

- en: The Game constructor first instantiates the GameView, Ball, and Paddle classes.
    The leftPaddle instance is created with Paddle.OFFSET for its x-coordinate ❶.
    The right one uses Paddle.OFFSET, Paddle.WIDTH, and this .gameView.width to determine
    its x-coordinate ❷, similar to how we calculated the position of the right paddle
    in the previous chapter.

  zh: Game构造函数首先实例化了GameView、Ball和Paddle类。leftPaddle实例通过Paddle.OFFSET来设置其x坐标 ❶。rightPaddle则通过Paddle.OFFSET、Paddle.WIDTH和this.gameView.width来确定其x坐标
    ❷，这与我们在上一章计算右边挡板位置的方式类似。

- en: 'Next, the Game constructor instantiates Scores ❸ and sets the gameOver Boolean
    to false. Finally, it sets up a mousemove event listener ❹ to update the right
    paddle’s position when the user moves the mouse. An event listener set up in a
    class constructor works just like the other event listeners we’ve seen in the
    book: it will be available as long as the application is running, and it triggers
    its handler function whenever the event is detected.'

  zh: 接下来，Game构造函数实例化了Scores ❸并将gameOver布尔值设置为false。最后，它设置了一个mousemove事件监听器 ❹，当用户移动鼠标时更新右侧挡板的位置。在类构造函数中设置的事件监听器与我们在本书中看到的其他事件监听器一样：只要应用程序运行，它就会一直有效，并在检测到事件时触发其处理函数。
- en: After the constructor is the Game class’s draw method, which has the top-level
    responsibility for drawing all the visual aspects of the game. First the method
    calls this.gameView.draw ❺, passing the three main game elements, this.ball, this.leftPaddle,
    and this.rightPaddle. This is a call to the draw method of the GameView class
    we saw in [Listing 11-1](#Lis11-1), which took a variable number of objects as
    arguments and called the draw method on each one. The net result is that game.draw
    calls gameView.draw, which calls ball.draw, leftPaddle.draw, and rightPaddle.draw.
    It may seem a bit roundabout, but you’ll often find cases like this in object-oriented
    code, where keeping the code in its logical place requires jumping through some
    hoops. In this case, game.draw is responsible for knowing *which* objects get
    drawn (because the Game class keeps track of all the game elements); gameView.draw
    is responsible for the drawing context, clearing the canvas, and calling the draw
    methods on the elements; and the draw method on each game element is responsible
    for knowing how to draw itself.

  zh: 构造函数之后是Game类的draw方法，它负责绘制游戏的所有视觉元素。首先，该方法调用this.gameView.draw ❺，传递了三个主要游戏元素：this.ball、this.leftPaddle和this.rightPaddle。这是对我们在[列表
    11-1](#Lis11-1)中看到的GameView类的draw方法的调用，它接收可变数量的对象作为参数，并对每个对象调用draw方法。最终的结果是，game.draw调用gameView.draw，进而调用ball.draw、leftPaddle.draw和rightPaddle.draw。这个过程看起来有点绕，但你会发现面向对象代码中经常会有类似的情况，保持代码在逻辑上合适的位置有时需要绕过一些复杂的步骤。在这个例子中，game.draw负责知道*哪些*对象需要绘制（因为Game类跟踪了所有的游戏元素）；gameView.draw负责绘制上下文、清空画布，并调用各个元素的draw方法；而每个游戏元素的draw方法则负责知道如何绘制自身。

- en: 'The Game class’s checkCollision method coordinates all the collision detection
    logic. First it calls the ball’s checkPaddleCollision method twice, to check for
    collisions between the ball and each of the paddles. Recall from [Listing 11-5](#Lis11-5)
    that this method takes two arguments: a Paddle object and a new, post-bounce value
    for xSpeed. For the left paddle, we know that we want the ball to bounce right,
    so we make the new xSpeed positive by taking the Math.abs of the current xSpeed
    ❶. For the right paddle we want the ball to bounce left, so we make the new xSpeed
    negative by negating the result of Math.abs(xSpeed) ❷.'

- en: Next, the checkCollision method calls ball.checkWallCollision to handle wall
    collisions ❸. This method takes the width and height (because the Ball object
    doesn’t know how big the playing area is) and the scores (so they can be incremented
    if a side wall is hit). Finally, the method checks to see if either score has
    exceeded the threshold ❹ and, if so, sets this.gameOver to true.

    repetition of the game loop. It calls the ball’s update method to move the ball,

    using the Computer.followBall static method.

    is true. If so ❼, we call draw again to render the final score, and we call gameView.drawGameOver
    to render the “GAME OVER” text. Otherwise, we use setTimeout to call the loop
    method again after 30 ms ❽, continuing the game.

    by the Game class’s constructor, so creating a Game object automatically creates
    all the other objects as well. We could also have had the Game constructor call
    the loop method to set the game in motion as part of the Game class instantiation.
    However, placing the first call to game.loop at the top level of the program makes
    it easier to see exactly where the game gets going.

- en: Object-oriented design is a complex field, and it can take a lot of practice
    to decompose programs into individual objects that make sense on their own. Even
    in this simple game, there are many ways you could split up the game’s components
    into objects and methods. For example, you might decide that the GameView class
    is unnecessary and that Game can keep track of the canvas, avoiding the need for
    the complex dance where draw calls draw calls draw. The main thing is to arrange
    your code in a way that makes sense and is easy for you and other programmers
    to understand and modify.

  zh: 面向对象设计是一个复杂的领域，通常需要大量的实践才能将程序分解成各自独立且合理的对象。即使在这个简单的游戏中，你也可以用许多不同的方式将游戏的组件拆分成对象和方法。例如，你可能会认为GameView类是不必要的，Game类本身就可以跟踪画布，从而避免复杂的绘制调用层层嵌套。最重要的是，以一种对你和其他程序员都易于理解和修改的方式来组织你的代码。

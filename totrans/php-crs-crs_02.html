<p class="INTRO">In this chapter, you’ll learn two ways to create and run PHP programs: using an online coding environment and using an editor installed locally on your own computer. We’ll try both techniques to practice key programming tasks like printing out text messages, assigning values to variables, and working with data of different types. We’ll also explore core PHP language features including comments, constants, and expressions.</p>

<h3 class="H1" id="sec1"><span id="toc-link_5"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Two Methods to Run PHP</span></h3>
<p class="TNI1">Often the easiest way to learn a programming language is to use an online environment that has everything already set up for you. This lets you start coding right away and see the results instantly, without having to install and <span aria-label="4" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_4" role="doc-pagebreak"/>configure language engines, code editors, web servers, or other tools. On the other hand, some prefer the customization and control that comes from working in a programming environment installed on their own machine.</p>
<p class="TX">In this section, you’ll get to explore both approaches as you write your first PHP programs. You can then use either method to follow along with the examples throughout this book.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="sec2" epub:type="division">
<h4 class="H2" id="sec2"><span id="toc-link_6"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_11">The Replit Online Coding Environment</span></h4>
<p class="TNI1">Several online sites facilitate interactive PHP development and can run PHP web servers for you. We’ll focus on Replit (<i><a href="https://replit.com">https://replit.com</a></i>), a popular service that’s free to use for starter projects. To try it out, go to the Replit website and create an account.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="Note"><span class="SANS_Dogma_OT_Bold_B_15">NOTE</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="NOTE-TXT"><i>Replit is named for the</i> <span class="note">read-evaluate-print loop (REPL),</span> <i>a type of computer environment where the programmer enters an expression and the system immediately executes it, prints out the response, and waits for the next input. A command line terminal, where you enter single-line commands and the terminal executes those commands, is a type of REPL.</i></p>
<p class="TX">Replit features two official, preconfigured templates for creating PHP projects: PHP CLI (short for <i>command line interface</i>) and PHP Web Server. The former is appropriate for projects that simply output text in a command line terminal window or work with data files, while the latter is for web development. Let’s take a look at each of these templates so you can learn a bit about how PHP programs work in the process.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="sec3" epub:type="division">
<h5 class="H3" id="sec3"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Creating a Command Line Interface Project</span></h5>
<p class="TNI1">To create a PHP command line interface project, go to the home screen of your Replit account and click <b>Create Repl</b>. This will launch a pop-up window where you can search for project templates. Enter <b>PHP</b> into the search box. The results should include the PHP CLI and PHP Web Server templates from Replit. (Below these official Replit templates, you may also see other templates created by Replit users and tagged for the PHP language.) Choose <b>PHP CLI</b> and enter a name for your project, or take the random-words default name offered. Then click <b>Create Repl</b> to launch the project.</p>
<p class="TX">The website will take a short while to set up your new project, including creating its file and folder structure and starting up a cloud virtual machine to run it. When the project loads, you’ll be presented with the three-column screen shown in <a href="#fig1-1">Figure 1-1</a>.</p>
<span aria-label="5" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_5" role="doc-pagebreak"/>
<figure class="IMG"><a id="fig1-1"/><img alt="" class="img100" height="384" src="../images/figure1-1.jpg" width="1691"/>
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_11">Figure 1-1: The new PHP CLI project screen, with the default “Hello, world!” script</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="TX">The left column lists the project’s files and folders, the middle column is an online code editor, and the right column is the command line terminal output (called <i>Console</i>) and an interactive terminal (called <i>Shell</i>) for the virtual computer that Replit has created. The Run button at the top of the screen runs the project, at which point any output will be displayed in the console.</p>
<p class="TX">A typical PHP project includes one or more files, called <i>scripts</i>, saved with the.<i>php</i> file extension. In this case, the Replit PHP CLI project automatically starts with a prewritten file called <i>main.php</i>. The file contains PHP code to output the message <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Hello, world!</span> in the console. Writing a program that displays this message is a tradition when learning a new language. Besides being fun, it provides an opportunity to learn how to name the text files containing your programs, how to write valid statements in your language of choice, and how to execute a program. What’s more, a “Hello, world!” script serves as a basic test of the language tools on the computer system: if the program runs and successfully outputs the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Hello, world!</span> message, that means PHP is working.</p>
<p class="TX"><a href="#lis1-1">Listing 1-1</a> shows the boilerplate “Hello, world!” script that Replit provides in <i>main.php</i>.</p>
<span id="lis1-1"/>
<pre><code>&lt;?php&#13;
echo "Hello, world!\n";</code></pre>
<p class="CodeListingCaption"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_11">Listing 1-1: The “Hello, world!” program in</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">main.php</span></p>
<p class="TX">The <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;?php</span> at the start of the script is an opening PHP tag. This tag signals that what follows is PHP code. In this case, the code uses the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">echo</span> command to print out the text <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Hello, world!</span> in the console, followed by a line break denoted with a newline character (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">\n</span>). Notice that the text to be <span aria-label="6" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_6" role="doc-pagebreak"/>printed is enclosed in double quotation marks. These quotes indicate that the text is a <i>string</i>, a type of data consisting of a sequence of characters. We’ll discuss strings and special characters like <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">\n</span> in detail in <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter3.xhtml">Chapter 3</a></span>.</p>
<p class="TX">The <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">echo</span> line of code is an example of a <i>statement</i>, a single command directing the computer to perform a task (in this case, to display some text). Every PHP statement must end with a semicolon (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W7Bold_11">;</span>) to indicate the command is over, as this <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">echo</span> statement does. Think of the semicolon as the period at the end of a sentence; without it, the statement is considered incomplete.</p>

<h5 class="H3" id="sec4"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Running the main.php Script</span></h5>
<p class="TNI1">Click the green <b>Run</b> button to run the <i>main.php</i> script. You should see the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Hello, world!</span> message printed to the console. Congratulations, you’ve just run your first PHP program! But what actually happened when you clicked Run?</p>
<p class="TX">PHP is a <i>scripted</i> programming language. This means a program called an <i>interpreter</i> translates the contents of a PHP file into machine code as the file is being executed. Other scripted languages include Python and JavaScript. Scripted languages are different from <i>compiled</i> programming languages like C, C++, and Swift, in which the translation happens in a separate step prior to execution. During this extra step, all program files are compiled and optimized into one or more executable files.</p>
<p class="TX">The interpreter that translates PHP scripts into executable code is usually called the <i>PHP engine</i>. When you click Replit’s Run button to run the <i>main.php</i> file, Replit invokes the PHP engine, which then reads the contents of the file and interprets and executes the lines of code inside it. For simple PHP scripts (such as our Replit <i>main.php</i>) that consist of just one or more statements meant to be executed in order, this is a straightforward process. Almost all programs involve more complex decision logic, however, performing tests so the code can respond dynamically to events and determine which statements to execute and in which order. The way the PHP engine decides what to do next is referred to as the <i>flow of control</i>. We’ll explore this concept further when we discuss conditionals and loops in <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter4.xhtml">Chapters 4</a></span> and <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter6.xhtml">6</a></span>.</p>
<p class="TX">Hitting Replit’s Run button isn’t the only way to run a PHP script. You can also invoke the PHP engine from the command line by using the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">php</span> command followed by the name of the script you want to execute. To try it out, switch over from the Console tab to the Shell tab in the right-hand column of your Replit project to bring up an interactive command line terminal. Then enter the following after the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$</span> prompt:</p>
<pre><code>$ <b>php main.php</b>&#13;
Hello, world!</code></pre>
<p class="TX">The <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">php main.php</span> command instructs the PHP engine to execute the <i>main.php</i> script. As before, this outputs the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Hello, world!</span> message. You can use this same technique to execute PHP files from the command line on your local machine, where you won’t necessarily have Replit’s convenient Run button.</p>

<h5 class="H3" id="sec5"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Creating a Web Server Project</span></h5>
<p class="TNI1">PHP is primarily used for developing web applications, so let’s now try creating a basic web-based PHP project by using Replit’s PHP Web Server template. Go back to your Replit account home page and create a new project, this time choosing the <b>PHP Web Server</b> template after entering <b>PHP</b> into the template search box. Your new project should look like <a href="#fig1-2">Figure 1-2</a>.</p>
<figure class="IMG"><a id="fig1-2"/><img alt="" class="img100" height="546" src="../images/figure1-2.jpg" width="1691"/>

</figure>
<p class="TX">The only file shown in the left column is a boilerplate <i>index.php</i> file. An <i>index</i> file such as this has special significance: it represents the default file served up when you visit the home page of a website. (We’ll discuss how this works in more detail when we explore web programming in <span class="Xref"><a href="part3.xhtml">Part III</a></span>.) The file’s contents are shown in the middle column. In the right column are the Console and Shell tabs, and this is also where a Webview tab will appear when we run the web server to show the rendered web page.</p>
<p class="TX">The <i>index.php</i> file should contain the code shown in <a href="#lis1-2">Listing 1-2</a>.</p>
<span id="lis1-2"/>
<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;&#13;

  &lt;body&gt;&#13;
  <span aria-label="annotation1" class="Code_CodeAnnotation">❶</span> &lt;?php echo '&lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;'; ?&gt;&#13;

<p class="CodeListingCaption"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_11">Listing 1-2: The web server script in</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">index.php</span></p>
<p class="TX">The bulk of this file isn’t PHP code but rather the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) needed to create a generic web page, as indicated by the opening <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;html&gt;</span> and closing <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;/html&gt;</span> tags at the beginning and end of the file, respectively. As we’ll discuss further in <span class="Xref">“Template Text vs. PHP Code” on <a href="#pg_13">page 13</a></span>, many PHP scripts mix dynamic PHP code meant to be interpreted and executed on the fly with static text in a language like HTML. In this case, the only PHP code is an <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">echo</span> statement to display the text <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Hello World</span> <span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotation">❶</span>. The text is wrapped in HTML <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;p&gt;</span> tags, meaning it will be rendered on the resulting web page as a body paragraph, and the entire <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">echo</span> statement <span aria-label="8" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_8" role="doc-pagebreak"/>is enclosed in PHP tags (the opening <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;?php</span> tag and the closing <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">?&gt;</span> tag) to indicate that it’s actual PHP code, unlike the surrounding HTML.</p>

<p class="TNI1">Click the <b>Run</b> button, and Replit will launch a web server hosting the <i>index.php</i> file and running the PHP engine needed to interpret the PHP code in the file. This time, instead of seeing text appear in a Console tab, you should see <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Hello World</span> displayed as a basic web page in the Webview tab (see <a href="#fig1-3">Figure 1-3</a>).</p>

</figure>
<p class="TX">When running the web server, Replit publishes temporary pages to its <i>replit.dev</i> domain. This means it provides publicly served web pages you can view and interact with in a separate web browser tab rather than just through the Replit site itself. To try this, click the green <i>{...}.replit.dev</i> URL address bar in the Webview panel. Then copy the URL shown in the pop-up window and paste it into a new tab in your web browser. You should see the same <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Hello World</span> message rendered as its own web page, separate from the Replit interface.

<h4 class="H2" id="sec7"><span id="toc-link_7"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_11">A Local PHP Installation</span></h4>
<p class="TNI1">Online editors like Replit can be fantastic, but they may be slow and restricted on free plans, and they require a reliable, fast internet connection. Many developers instead prefer to work locally on their own machine. To do this, the first step is to install PHP on your computer. If you haven’t already done so, follow the guidelines in <span class="Xref"><a href="appendix-a.xhtml">Appendix A</a></span> to install the latest version of PHP for your operating system.</p>
<p class="TX">Once PHP is installed, you’ll need an <i>integrated development environment (IDE)</i> where you can write your code. An IDE is a powerful text editor that includes useful programming tools like a terminal, sophisticated search-and-replace functions, code spelling correction, and even automatic code generation for common tasks.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label="9" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_9" role="doc-pagebreak"/>In this section, we’ll focus on local PHP development with PhpStorm, a popular IDE from JetBrains. Anyone can use it free for 30 days, and from there many people (such as students, teachers, and those in coding bootcamps, user groups, and open source projects) can get a free license. Visit <i><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/</a></i> to download PhpStorm and follow the installation instructions.</p>

<h5 class="H3" id="sec8"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Creating “Hello, world!” with PhpStorm</span></h5>
<p class="TNI1">Let’s create a “Hello, world!” project with PhpStorm, similar to the default script that comes with Replit’s PHP CLI template. Open the PhpStorm IDE, click <b>New Project</b>, and choose <b>PHP Empty Project</b> from the list of possible templates. Select a location for the project and change the <i>untitled</i> default name to your desired project name. Make sure to include a forward slash before your project’s name in the location path, as in <i>/program1</i>. Then click <b>Create</b>.</p>
<p class="TX">PhpStorm will set up a new folder with your chosen project name in the desired location. All the files for the project will be contained in this folder; more complex projects might also have subfolders to organize data, program files, configuration files, and so on. With the folder created, PhpStorm will load into the project-editing view shown in <a href="#fig1-4">Figure 1-4</a>.</p>

<figcaption><p class="CAP"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_11">Figure 1-4: The three main PhpStorm panels</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="TX">The top-left panel in PhpStorm shows the project folder and its contents. The top-right panel is where you edit your code and data files. Click the Terminal (<b>&gt;_</b>) icon in the left-hand column of the application window to open a command line terminal at the bottom of the application window, <span aria-label="10" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_10" role="doc-pagebreak"/>where you can enter commands and see the text output of your programs. This terminal automatically opens at the project folder location.</p>
<p class="TX">We’re ready to add a basic “Hello, world!” script to the project. Select your project folder in the top-left panel of the application window and then choose <b>File</b> <span class="MenuArrow">▸</span> <b>New</b> <span class="MenuArrow">▸</span> <b>PHP File</b> from the top menu. Enter <b>hello</b> for the filename (PhpStorm will add the .<i>php</i> file extension for you) and click <b>OK</b>. You should see this new <i>hello.php</i> file appear in the project contents panel, and the file should be opened for editing in the code-editing panel, already containing the opening PHP tag (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;?php</span>) needed to designate the file’s contents as PHP code. Now edit the file so it matches the code in <a href="#lis1-3">Listing 1-3</a>.</p>

<p class="TX">As in our Replit command line program, this code simply prints out the text <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Hello, world!</span> followed by a newline character (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">\n</span>). Notice that this time the statement uses <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">print</span> rather than <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">echo</span> to display the text. The two are largely interchangeable; see the following <span class="Xref">“</span><span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">print</span> <span class="Xref">or</span> <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">echo</span><span class="Xref">?”</span> box for more information.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">In PHP, you can use either</span> <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">print</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">or</span> <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">echo</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">to display text. The two have subtle differences, but they aren’t relevant to beginning PHP programming, so for our purposes we can consider</span> <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">print</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">and</span> <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">echo</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">statements to be essentially equivalent. Which you use comes down to personal preference. Personally, I think the word</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_11">print</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">is a closer match to the intent behind such program statements, so I’ll use</span> <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">print</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">throughout this book. On the other hand, older PHP programs (or new code written by older PHP programmers) tend to use</span> <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">echo</span><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">, since</span> <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">print</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">was a later addition to the language.</span></p>
<p class="BoxBodyLast"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">In many programming languages, the equivalent of</span> <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">print</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">or</span> <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">echo</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">is considered a</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_11">function</span><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">, and therefore the text to be output must be provided inside a set of parentheses after the function name.

<p class="TX">To run your script, open the Terminal panel (if you haven’t already done so) and enter the following at the command line:</p>
<pre><code>% <b>php hello.php</b>&#13;

<p class="BodyContinued">You should see the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Hello, world!</span> message appear on the next line in the terminal.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label="11" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_11" role="doc-pagebreak"/>A second way to run your script in PhpStorm is to click the green Run button (next to the green “bug” button) at the top right of the application window. This should execute the file currently being edited. If clicking the button opens a drop-down menu offering a choice of PHP and JS (JavaScript) ways to run the script, choose the PHP option.</p>
<p class="TX">If you execute the script this way, a Run panel should open at the bottom of the screen showing the PHP engine you’re using and the location of the script being executed. This information is useful if you have multiple versions of the PHP engine on a single computer so that you can test scripts for compatibility with the different engines. Below this should be the output of running the program, followed by an exit code of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">0</span> indicating the program successfully completed execution.</p>

<h5 class="H3" id="sec9"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Running a PHP Web Server Locally</span></h5>
<p class="TNI1">When you install PHP, it comes with a built-in web server for testing web development projects locally on your system. You can see information about this web server (and verify that it’s working) by using the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">phpinfo()</span> function.

<p class="TX">You may wish to scroll through this web page to learn more about your system’s PHP setup. You’ll find the version of the PHP engine, the location of the <i>php.ini</i> configuration file, information about what database extensions (if any) are enabled, the names of key contributors to the PHP language, and more.</p>
<p class="TX">You can also view the result of your <i>index.php</i> script in a real web browser like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox rather than within PhpStorm. (If you’re using a different IDE, this may be your only option.) First, open the IDE’s terminal and enter the following command:</p>
<pre><code>% <b>php -S localhost:8000</b></code></pre>
<p class="TX">This tells PHP to launch its built-in web server and make the current project available at <i>localhost:8000</i>. Here, <i>localhost</i> refers to your local computer system, and <i>8000</i> sets the port number. Each application that needs to send and receive messages over the internet needs a unique port number; you can think of these ports as different mailboxes at the same location. Web servers for testing purposes usually use port number 8000 or 8080, whereas production (live) web servers usually run at port 80. Personally, I always use 8000 when developing locally.</p>
<p class="TX">With the web server running, open a web browser and enter <b>localhost:8000</b> in the address bar. You should see your PHP script’s output as before. When you’re done, go back to the terminal and press <small>CTRL</small>-C to terminate the web server.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label="13" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_13" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Note that to view a script that isn’t named <i>index.php</i> in the browser, you’ll have to append the script’s filename to the end of the URL in the browser address bar. For example, to view the <i>hello.php</i> script from <a href="#lis1-3">Listing 1-3</a> as a web page, you would first run the PHP web server with the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">php -S localhost:8000</span> command, then navigate to <i>localhost:8000/hello.php</i> in your browser.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">If you try to start your web server on port 8000 and get an error stating that the port is already in use, one solution is to try an alternative port number, such as 8001, 8080, or 8888. However, you also may want to find out which application is already running at port 8000, since your computer might already be running a web server in the background that you don’t know about.</span></p>
<p class="BoxBodyLast"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">Although running several web servers on your computer is perfectly possible, you’ll almost always be testing only one web application project at a time, so if several servers are running, you could end up testing the server responses to a different application from the one you’re working on. Personally, if I get a message that I can’t start a web server on port 8000 because it’s already in use, I track down and kill that process (or just reboot the computer) to ensure that I can test the project I’m working on with just one server running on port 8000.</span></p>

<h3 class="H1" id="sec10"><span id="toc-link_8"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Template Text vs. PHP Code</span></h3>
<p class="TNI1">PHP is a popular language for web development because of how easy it is for PHP scripts to output HTML (or CSS or JavaScript) for display in a web browser. Some parts of the output are typically unchanging <i>template text</i>, while other parts are dynamically generated through the execution of PHP program statements. This combination of static template text and dynamic, code-generated text is the backbone of just about any interactive website.</p>
<p class="TX">As an example, think about viewing a shopping cart at an online retail site. The web designer doesn’t need to write a separate script for displaying every possible configuration of items in a shopping cart. They just have to write one script that mixes the generic template text for the elements that would appear in any shopping cart (the hidden HTML head elements, a navigation bar, the company logo, and the like) with the PHP code needed to dynamically fill in the name, price, quantity, and other details of each specific cart item.</p>
<p class="TX">The ability to mix template text with PHP code is why we’ve needed the opening <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;?php</span> tag in our scripts so far, and why we sometimes need the closing <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">?&gt;</span> tag as well. Anything outside these tags is treated as template text and will be output verbatim; anything inside these tags is interpreted as PHP code and executed accordingly. If the script consists entirely of PHP <span aria-label="14" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_14" role="doc-pagebreak"/>code, as in <a href="#lis1-1">Listings 1-1</a>, <a href="#lis1-3">1-3</a>, and <a href="#lis1-4">1-4</a>, then only the opening <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;?php</span> is needed; if the PHP code is followed by template text, as in <a href="#lis1-2">Listing 1-2</a>, the closing <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">?&gt;</span> tag is needed as well.</p>
<p class="TX">To clarify the difference between template text and PHP code, let’s write an example script that combines the two. Create a new project (either online with Replit or locally with PhpStorm), and inside this project create a new file called <i>hello2.php</i>. Edit the file to match the contents of <a href="#lis1-5">Listing 1-5</a> exactly.</p>
<span id="lis1-5"/>
<pre><code>I am template text, not PHP code.&#13;
print "Hello, world!\n";&#13;
I am more template text.</code></pre>
<p class="CodeListingCaption"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_11">Listing 1-5: The</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">hello2.php</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_11">script, featuring template text with no PHP code-block tags</span></p>
<p class="TX">The first and third lines of this script are template text and are meant to be output directly when the script is executed. The middle line is PHP code to output the phrase <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Hello, world!</span> followed by a line break. Or is it? Try running this script by entering <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W7Bold_11">php hello2.php</span> in a command line terminal. Here’s the result:</p>
<pre><code>% <b>php hello2.php</b>&#13;
I am template text, not PHP code.&#13;
print "Hello, world!\n";&#13;
I am more template text.%</code></pre>
<p class="TX">The output reproduces all three lines of text verbatim, just as they appear in the file. In particular, the middle line includes PHP code elements like the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">print</span> keyword, quotation marks, and semicolon that weren’t meant to be seen. The problem is that we haven’t included any opening or closing tags to designate the middle line as PHP code, so the entire script has been interpreted as template text and output directly.</p>
<p class="TX">Notice also that the last line of output ends with a new terminal prompt (in this case, a percent symbol). This is because spaces, tabs, and newline characters are copied exactly as they’re written when they appear outside the PHP script tags as template text. The terminal then picks up right away with a new prompt wherever the output leaves off, without adding an extra line break. Had we included a blank line at the end of the <i>hello2.php</i> script, the new terminal prompt would appear on its own line.</p>
<p class="TX">Let’s update our script to fix both of these problems. <a href="#lis1-6">Listing 1-6</a> shows a revised version of <i>hello2.php</i>, with the changes bolded.</p>
<span id="lis1-6"/>
<pre><code>I am template text, not PHP code.&#13;
<b>&lt;?php</b>&#13;
print "Hello, world!\n";&#13;
<b>?&gt;</b>&#13;
I am more template text.</code></pre>
<p class="CodeListingCaption"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_11">Listing 1-6: Fixing</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">hello2.php</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_11">to distinguish template text from PHP code</span></p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label="15" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_15" role="doc-pagebreak"/>We’ve added an opening <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;?php</span> tag before the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">print</span> statement and a closing <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">?&gt;</span> tag after it. This tells the PHP interpreter that what falls between the tags should be interpreted and executed as PHP code. We’ve also added a blank line to the end of the script.</p>
<p class="TX">If you rerun this script, the PHP engine should now find the starting and ending PHP program tags wrapped around the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">print "Hello, world!\n";</span> statement, and so, as well as outputting template text outside those tags, it will execute that line of code to print out <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Hello, world!</span> and a newline character. Here’s the result of executing the script again:</p>
<pre><code>% <b>php hello2.php</b>&#13;
I am template text, not PHP code.&#13;
Hello, world!&#13;
I am more template text.&#13;
%</code></pre>
<p class="TX">This time, notice that the first and last lines of the script have been output verbatim as template text, while the middle line contains only the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Hello, world!</span> message, indicating it has successfully been interpreted as PHP code. The new terminal prompt now also appears on its own line, since we included a blank line at the end of the script in <a href="#lis1-6">Listing 1-6</a>.</p>

<h3 class="H1" id="sec11"><span id="toc-link_9"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Comments</span></h3>
<p class="TNI1"><i>Comments</i> are a useful feature of any programming language. They’re a way to tell the PHP engine to ignore some text written within a PHP code block, so the text will neither be output nor be interpreted as code that should be executed.</p>
<p class="TX">Comments can play several roles in a computer program. First, they’re a way to embed human-readable notes in the code, such as an explanation of how something works, why you’ve done something the way you have, or a reminder about something you still need to do. Second, turning one or more lines of code into a comment is a great way to temporarily disable that code while debugging or trying an alternative way of doing something, without having to delete the code altogether. Finally, comments can also contain special content for preprocessing tools such as documentation generators or code-testing utilities.</p>
<p class="TX">As with most languages, PHP provides several ways to define comments. A single-line comment begins with two forward slashes (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">//</span>) and looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>// I am a comment and will be ignored.</code></pre>
<p class="TX">Everything on the line after the two slashes is treated as a comment and ignored when the code is executed. This means you can place a comment after a program statement on the same line, and the program statement itself will still be executed, like so:</p>
<pre><code>print 2 + 2; // Should print 4</code></pre>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label="16" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_16" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Here <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">print 2 + 2</span> will be executed, resulting in an output of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">4</span>, but the PHP engine will ignore the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">// Should print 4</span> comment at the end of the line.</p>
<p class="TX">A comment that starts with <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">/*</span> and ends with <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">*/</span> can span multiple lines. <a href="#lis1-7">Listing 1-7</a> illustrates this multiline comment syntax.</p>
<span id="lis1-7"/>
<pre><code>/*&#13;
I&#13;
am&#13;
a multiline&#13;
comment.&#13;
*/</code></pre>
<p class="CodeListingCaption"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_11">Listing 1-7: A multiline comment example</span></p>
<p class="TX">This style of comment is especially useful if you have a longer block of code that you want to temporarily disable, or <i>comment out</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="Note"><span class="SANS_Dogma_OT_Bold_B_15">NOTE</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="NOTE-TXT"><i>You may also meet the older shell-style single-line comment, which begins with the</i> <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_Italic_11">#</span> <i>character rather than two slashes, if you work with or have to maintain legacy code written many years ago. While these shell-style comments are still valid in PHP programs, the</i> <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_Italic_11">//</span> <i>syntax is the preferred style of single-line comment in modern PHP programming.</i></p>

<h3 class="H1" id="sec12"><span id="toc-link_10"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Variables</span></h3>
<p class="TNI1">A distinguishing feature of computer programs is that they are <i>dynamic</i>, meaning their behavior can change each time they’re executed based on different data and events. Fundamental to this is the use of <i>variables</i>, named values or references to data within code. Variables allow you to store values and refer to them with a meaningful name (an <i>identifier</i>).</p>
<p class="TX">They’re called variables because the value they refer to can change each time a program is executed. For example, a variable might refer to the current date or time, and a program might have logic to do something special based on the value of this variable. Perhaps it will display a greeting on the user’s birthday or trigger an alarm each day at 6 <small>AM</small>. Another variable might represent the size of a logfile, and the program might automatically back up the contents of this file and start a new one whenever the size exceeds a certain threshold.</p>
<p class="TX">The values of variables don’t just change from one run of a program to another; they can also change <i>during</i> the course of a program’s execution. For example, a variable representing the total value of an online shopping cart will start at 0 and then update as items are added or removed. A variable holding the number of simultaneous users logged into a system would also change as a program runs. At busy times, if the value is very high, more memory or disk space may need to be added to the system.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="sec13" epub:type="division">

<h4 class="H2" id="sec13"><span id="toc-link_11"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_11">Creating Variables</span></h4>
<p class="TNI1">You create a PHP variable by giving it a name and assigning it a value. Here, for example, we create a variable called <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$age</span> and assign it a value of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">21</span>:</p>
<pre><code>$age = 21;</code></pre>
<p class="TX">PHP variable names must begin with a dollar sign (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$</span>), something that distinguishes PHP code from almost all other programming languages. Assigning a value to a variable hinges around an equal sign (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">=</span>), known in this context as the <i>assignment operator</i>. The variable name goes on the left of the equal sign and its value on the right. Since setting a variable’s value is a type of statement, the whole thing ends with a semicolon.</p>
<p class="TX">The code to the right of the assignment operator is an expression. An <i>expression</i> is something that yields a single value or can be evaluated into a single value. The simplest expression is simply a literal value, like the number <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">21</span> in this example. A <i>literal</i> is a value that is expressed as itself. Examples are <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">21</span> (the whole number twenty-one), <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">3.5</span> (the floating-point number three-point-five), <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span> (the truth value <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span>), and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">"Matt Smith"</span> (the text string <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Matt Smith</span>).</p>
<p class="TX">Other expressions are more complex. They might involve mathematical calculations, incorporate other variables, or even, as you’ll see in <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter5.xhtml">Chapter 5</a></span>, feature a call to a function. In these cases, the expression must be <i>evaluated</i>, meaning its resulting value is determined, before that value is assigned to the variable. <a href="#lis1-8">Listing 1-8</a> illustrates some examples of assignment statements.</p>
<span id="lis1-8"/>
<pre><code>&lt;?php&#13;
$username = "matt";            // A string literal&#13;
$total = 3 + 5;                // A calculated expression&#13;
$numSlices = $numPizzas * 8;   // A calculation with another variable&#13;
$timestamp = time();           // A function that returns a value</code></pre>
<p class="CodeListingCaption"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_11">Listing 1-8: Examples of assigning the value of an expression to a variable</span></p>
<p class="TX">We first assign the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$username</span> variable the value <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">"matt"</span>, a string literal. Variables can hold values representing many types of data, as we’ll discuss in detail in <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter2.xhtml">Chapter 2</a></span>. We next assign the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$total</span> variable the value of the calculation <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">3 + 5</span>. This variable will therefore hold the number <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">8</span>. For the value of the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$numSlices</span> variable, we multiply the value of another variable, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$numPizzas</span>, by <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">8</span> (the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">*</span> symbol denotes multiplication in PHP). Finally, we set the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$timestamp</span> variable to the value that results from calling the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">time()</span> function. (You’ll learn more about how to get values out of functions in <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter5.xhtml">Chapter 5</a></span>.)</p>
<p class="TX">If you try to execute the code in <a href="#lis1-8">Listing 1-8</a>, it won’t quite work. PHP will produce a warning message like the following:</p>
<pre><code>PHP Warning: Undefined variable $numPizzas in main.php on line 4</code></pre>
<p class="TX">The problem here is that the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$numPizzas</span> variable is <i>undefined</i>, meaning it hasn’t been given a value. It’s important to always assign a value to a variable before you first make use of it.</p>

<p class="TNI1">Once you’ve created a variable, you can use its name anywhere you need to reference that variable’s value. For example, <a href="#lis1-9">Listing 1-9</a> shows a program illustrating how to use variables to calculate and print the total number of pizza slices, given a number of pizzas. Create a <i>pizza.php</i> file containing the contents of this listing.</p>
<span id="lis1-9"/>
<pre><code>&lt;?php&#13;
$numPizzas = 1;&#13;
$numSlices = $numPizzas * 8;&#13;
print $numSlices;&#13;
print "\n";&#13;
&#13;

$numSlices = $numPizzas * 8;&#13;
print $numSlices;&#13;
print "\n";</code></pre>
<p class="CodeListingCaption"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_11">Listing 1-9: Working with variables in</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">pizza.php</span></p>
<p class="TX">First, we assign the numeric value <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">1</span> to the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$numPizzas</span> variable. Then we multiply the value of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$numPizzas</span> by <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">8</span> to assign the value of the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$numSlices</span> variable. Remember, variables must be written starting with a dollar sign; you’ll get used to this very quickly as you write more PHP. We next use a <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">print</span> statement to show the value inside <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$numSlices</span>, followed by another <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">print</span> statement with the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">\n</span> newline character to create a line break.</p>
<p class="TX">As mentioned, the value of a variable can change while a program is running, so we next update the value inside the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$numPizzas</span> variable from <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">1</span> to <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">3</span>. Then we update the value of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$numSlices</span> by again multiplying <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$numPizzas</span> by <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">8</span>, and we print out the new value. Here’s the result of executing this program at the command line:</p>
<pre><code>% <b>php pizza.php</b>&#13;
8&#13;
24</code></pre>
<p class="TX">Notice that the value of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$numSlices</span> changes from <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">8</span> to <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">24</span> over the course of the program. These values, in turn, are calculated based on the changing values of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$numPizzas</span>. Try changing the number inside the variable <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$numPizzas</span> yourself to get a different number of slices.</p>

<h4 class="H2" id="sec15"><span id="toc-link_13"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_11">Naming Variables</span></h4>
<p class="TNI1">A few rules and conventions exist for naming variables in PHP. First and foremost, as we’ve already discussed, all variable names must start with a dollar sign. If you forget the dollar sign when referencing a variable, PHP will usually report an undefined constant fatal error, and the program will crash. (We’ll discuss constants in the next section.)</p>
<p class="TX">The next character in a variable name after the dollar sign must be a letter of the alphabet (or in certain cases, an underscore). By convention, <span aria-label="19" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_19" role="doc-pagebreak"/>this letter should be lowercase. While a capital letter is technically permitted, an initial capital is usually reserved for class names rather than variable names. (You’ll begin learning about classes and object-oriented programming in <span class="Xref"><a href="part5.xhtml">Part V</a></span>.) The remaining symbols in a variable name can be letters, numerals, or underscores.</p>
<p class="TX">Single-word variable names should typically be all lowercase, as in <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$name</span> or <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$total</span>. For variable names with multiple words, we follow two common conventions. One is <i>snake case</i> : everything is lowercase, and the words are separated by underscores, as in <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$game_lives_remaining</span> or <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$customer_number</span>. The other is <i>lower camel case</i>: the first word is all lowercase, and subsequent words start with a capital letter, as in <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$gameLivesRemaining</span> or <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$customerNumber</span>.</p>
<p class="TX">The most important rules of thumb are to be consistent in whatever naming convention you choose, to follow PHP’s style recommendations when possible, and above all, to choose names that clearly communicate what the variable represents. A name like <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$customerNumber</span> is clearer than something abbreviated like <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$custNo</span> and certainly clearer than a meaningless variable name like <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$x</span> or <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$variable</span>.</p>
<p class="TX">Keep in mind that PHP variable names are case sensitive, so identifiers like <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$username</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$userName</span> will be treated as separate variables. If you get the capitalization wrong when you reference a variable (or otherwise type the variable name incorrectly), PHP won’t know what you mean. <a href="#lis1-10">Listing 1-10</a> shows an example.</p>
<span id="lis1-10"/>
<pre><code>&lt;?php&#13;
$username = "matt";&#13;
print $userName;</code></pre>
<p class="CodeListingCaption"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_11">Listing 1-10: Misspelling a variable name</span></p>
<p class="TX">We assign the value <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">"matt"</span> to the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$username</span> variable, then attempt to print the value of this variable. Because of the incorrect capitalization in <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$userName</span>, however, executing this script at the command line will result in a warning message like the following:</p>
<pre><code>PHP Warning:  Undefined variable $userName in main.php on line 3</code></pre>
<p class="TX">Because PHP variables are case sensitive, the PHP engine interprets <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$userName</span> as a reference to a completely different variable that hasn’t previously been given a value. In PHP’s eyes, this is therefore the same problem as trying to use the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$numPizzas</span> variable without first defining it in <a href="#lis1-8">Listing 1-8</a>.</p>
<p class="TX">Keep in mind that while some aspects of PHP, like variable names, are case sensitive, other aspects of the language are case insensitive, meaning capitalization doesn’t matter. These include keywords like <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">if</span>, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">for</span>, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">switch</span>, and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">print</span>; data types such as <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">int</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">string</span>; values such as <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">true</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">false</span>; and function and method names. That said, it’s common practice to use lowercase for language keywords and data types, and lower camel case for function and method names. The exercises at the end of the chapter suggest a coding style guide that can help you learn more about these conventions.</p>

<p class="TNI1">Some values never change, such as the value of <i><span lang="el" xml:lang="el">π</span></i> (always 3.14) or the neutral value on the pH scale (always 7). When referencing such values in code, it’s best to use a <i>constant</i> rather than a variable. Unlike a variable, once a constant is defined, its value can’t be updated. By convention, the names of constants are written in <i>upper snake case</i>, with all capital letters and underscores between words, as in <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">MAX_PROJECTS</span> or <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">NEUTRAL_PH</span>. Unlike variables, constants don’t start with a dollar sign.</p>

<p class="TX">You can also create your own custom constants by using the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">define()</span> function. The script in <a href="#lis1-11">Listing 1-11</a> shows an example.</p>
<span id="lis1-11"/>
<pre><code>&lt;?php&#13;
define("MAX_PROJECTS", 99);&#13;
print "The maximum number of projects is: ";&#13;
<span aria-label="21" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_21" role="doc-pagebreak"/>print MAX_PROJECTS;&#13;
print "\n";</code></pre>
<p class="CodeListingCaption"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_11">Listing 1-11: Defining and printing a constant</span></p>
<p class="TX">We call the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">define()</span> function to create a constant named <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">MAX_PROJECTS</span> with the value <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">99</span>. This makes the constant available for use anywhere in the code. We then print out the value of the constant as part of a message. (Multiple <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">print</span> statements in a row will output to the same line if they don’t contain any line breaks; the final <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">print "\n"</span> adds a newline to ensure that the next output—in this case, the next command line prompt—will appear on its own line.) The output of running this script should be as follows:</p>
<pre><code>The maximum number of projects is: 99</code></pre>
<p class="TX">Notice that the constant’s name must be enclosed in quotation marks when we create it with the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">define()</span> function. Without these quotation marks, creating the constant wouldn’t work. For example, if you were to write <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">define(MAX_PROJECTS, 99)</span> without quotes, PHP would interpret <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">MAX _PROJECTS</span> as a reference to a previously defined constant and would report an error. Once you’ve defined a constant, however, you don’t need the quotation marks when you reference it.</p>

<p class="TX">As in mathematics, these operators have an <i>order of precedence</i> that controls the way an expression is evaluated when it contains multiple operations. The arithmetic operators for multiplication, division, and modulo have higher precedence, while the operators for addition and subtraction have lower precedence. Therefore, in the arithmetic expression <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">1 + 2 * 3</span>, the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">2 * 3</span> component will first be evaluated to <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">6</span>, and then <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">1 + 6</span> will be evaluated, so the whole expression evaluates to <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">7</span>. You can use parentheses to force precedence; for example, the expression <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">(1 + 2) * 3</span> evaluates to <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">9</span> rather than <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">7</span> since the parentheses force the addition component to be evaluated to <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">3</span> before the multiplication component.</p>

<h4 class="H2" id="sec19"><span id="toc-link_17"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_11">Combined Arithmetic Assignment Operators</span></h4>
<p class="TNI1">We’ve already discussed how the basic <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">=</span> assignment operator takes a value and assigns it to a variable. Other assignment operators, such as <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">+=</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">-=</span>, combine assignment with arithmetic. These combined operators exist because it’s common to want to take the value in a variable, perform a calculation with it, and store the result back in the same variable, replacing the previous value.</p>
<p class="TX">To illustrate, say we have a <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$total</span> variable for keeping track of the total cost of the items in an online shopping cart. Every time the user adds or removes an item from the cart, we’d want to change <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$total</span> by the cost of that item. We could do this with the regular <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">=</span> operator by writing something like <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$total = $total + 25</span> or <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$total = $total - 15</span>. With combined arithmetic assignment operators, however, we can accomplish the same task by using more concise syntax: <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$total += 25</span> or <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$total -= 15</span>. These statements <span aria-label="23" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_23" role="doc-pagebreak"/>instruct the PHP engine to update the value of the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$total</span> variable by adding <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">25</span> or subtracting <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">15</span> from its previous value.</p>
<p class="TX">Similar arithmetic assignment operators are used for the other arithmetic operations. For instance, the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">*=</span> operator multiplies a variable by a given value. The others, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">/=</span>, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">%=</span>, and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">**=</span> for division, modulo, and exponentiation, respectively, are used much less often.</p>

<h4 class="H2" id="sec20"><span id="toc-link_18"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_11">Increment and Decrement Operators</span></h4>
<p class="TNI1">Numbers can also be <i>incremented</i> (increased by 1) or <i>decremented</i> (decreased by 1) using special operators: a double plus sign (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">++</span>) for incrementing and a double minus sign (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">--</span>) for decrementing. As with the combined arithmetic assignment operators, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">++</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">--</span> provide a more concise syntax for a common programming task. For example, to add <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">1</span> to the existing value of the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$age</span> variable, we could use the basic assignment operator and write <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$age = $age + 1</span>, or use an arithmetic assignment operator and write <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$age += 1</span>. With the increment operator, however, we simply write <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$age++</span>. Likewise, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$age--</span> subtracts <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">1</span> from the value of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$age</span>. These are examples of <i>unary operators</i>, meaning they expect only a single operand.</p>
<p class="TX">When you want to use the result of an increment or decrement operation in an expression, the placement of the operator before or after the value it operates on matters. Say <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$age</span> contains an integer value of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">21</span>. The expression <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$age++</span> yields the current value of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$age</span> (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">21</span>) and then increments the variable. On the other end, <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">++$age</span> will first apply the increment and then yield the variable’s newly incremented value (<span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">22</span>). <a href="#lis1-12">Listing 1-12</a> illustrates this distinction.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php&#13;

<p class="CodeListingCaption"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_11">Listing 1-12: Demonstrating the difference between pre- and post-increment operators</span></p>
<p class="TX">Here we set both <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$person1Age</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$person2Age</span> to <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">21</span>, then use <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">++</span> to increment each person’s age. However, since we use <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">++$person1Age</span> in one case <span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotation">❶</span> and <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$person2Age++</span> in the other <span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotation">❷</span>, the printed results are different, as the script’s output shows:</p>
<pre><code>Person 1 age = 22&#13;
Person 1 age (after increment) = 22&#13;
<span aria-label="annotation1" class="codeannotated_CodeAnnotation">❶</span> Person 2 age = 21&#13;
Person 2 age (after increment) = 22</code></pre>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label="24" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_24" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Both times we print <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$person1Age</span>, we see <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">22</span> in the output. This is because placing the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">++</span> operator before the variable ensures that its value is incremented from <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">21</span> to <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">22</span> before it’s first printed. By contrast, placing the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">++</span> operator after <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$person2Age</span> allows us to first see its original value of <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">21</span> <span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotation">❶</span>, since it forces the increment operation to take place after the variable’s value is used in the expression.</p>
<p class="TX">To avoid confusion about whether the pre- and post-increment value will be used, many programmers opt to use two separate lines of code: one with a statement incrementing a variable’s value, and another with a statement to make use of that new value, as in <a href="#lis1-13">Listing 1-13</a>.</p>
<span id="lis1-13"/>
<pre><code>$person1Age = 21;&#13;
$person1Age++;&#13;
print $person1Age;</code></pre>
<p class="CodeListingCaption"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_11">Listing 1-13: Separating the increment operation from the</span> <span class="TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_Italic_11">print</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_11">statement</span></p>
<p class="TX">Here we use one statement to only increment <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">$person1Age</span> and another statement to only print the variable’s value. This unambiguously ensures that the resulting output will be <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">22</span>.</p>

<p class="TNI1">We’ve covered some important PHP programming basics in this chapter. We looked at two ways to create and run PHP programs: using the Replit online environment and using the PhpStorm IDE on your local computer. We covered statements, expressions, variables, constants, and operators, which are all key building blocks of computer programs, and we discussed how to use comments to help make code more readable for humans and to temporarily disable blocks of code when developing and debugging programs. We also took a first look at how to interweave PHP program statements with unchanging template text, a fundamental technique for creating web applications that can dynamically customize the web pages returned to users.</p>

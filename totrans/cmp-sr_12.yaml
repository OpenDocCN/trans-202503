- en: 'Skype is an app for communicating that gives you a way to make video or audio
    calls to your friends and family. It comes already installed on your Windows 10
    computer and is free to use. It’s similar to a telephone but with two huge advantages:
    you can see the person you’re calling, and you can send written messages. For
    example, you can send happy-birthday notes, arrange lunch meetings, or even plan
    on a time to share a video call.'

- en: For Skype to work, both you and the person you want to contact need to have
    the Skype app on your computer. Fortunately, everyone with the latest version
    of Windows 10 will already have the Skype app installed. Millions of people around
    the world use Skype, so it’s a very well-known app, and because it’s free, a lot
    of people have it or can easily get it.

    make a call or send a message. To make a call, you also need speakers and a microphone,
    and if you want to use video on your calls, you also need a *webcam* (a camera
    for your computer). All laptops and tablets will have these built in, and if you
    don’t already have speakers, a microphone, and a webcam for your desktop computer,
    they are easily obtained from a local computer or electronics store.

    a Skype contact. Adding a profile picture of yourself will make it easier for
    your friends and family to find the real you. If you’re reluctant to add a picture
    of yourself, you can instead add a picture connected to your hobbies or interests.

    that a friend or family member become your contact, and then they must accept
    your request before you can call or message them. If you’ve put contacts into
    your email address book in the past, you might find them showing up here in Skype
    as well. Don’t be alarmed if that’s the case.
  prefs: []

    adding them as a contact, but in any case, it’s polite to add someone as a contact
    before calling them. Once they’re added, they’ll appear in your list of contacts,
    which will make it much easier to talk to them in the future.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can add a contact by searching for their profile using their name, email
    address, or cell phone number, if they chose to provide it. Searching for someone
    using their email address is usually more accurate because an email address has
    to be unique, while many people can have the same name. But if you don’t know
    someone’s email address, you can search for their name and use their profile picture
    to try to identify them. Alternatively, if your contact has an account that they
    created many years ago before Microsoft purchased Skype, they may have a different
    username known as a *Skype Name* that you can also use to find them.

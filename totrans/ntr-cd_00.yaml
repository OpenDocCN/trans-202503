    and print book exploring the unpredictable evolutionary and emergent properties
    of nature in software via the creative coding framework Processing. It’s the understatement
    of the century to say that much has changed in the world of technology and creative
    media since then, and so here I am again, with a new and rebooted version of this
    book built around JavaScript and the p5.js library. The book has a few new coding
    tricks this time, but it’s the same old nature—birds still flap their wings, and
    apples still fall on our heads.

- en: At ITP/IMA (Tisch School of the Arts, New York University), I’ve been teaching
    a course titled Introduction to Computational Media since 2004\. The origins of
    this class date back to 1987 and the work of Mike Mills and John Henry Thompson
    (inventor of the Lingo programming language). In the course, students learn the
    basics of programming (variables, conditionals, loops, objects, arrays) as well
    as concepts related to making interactive media projects (pixels, data, sound,
    networking, 3D, and more). In 2008, I synthesized my materials for this class
    into an introductory book, *Learning Processing*, and in 2015, I created a series
    of video tutorials that follow the same trajectory in JavaScript with the p5.js
    library.

  zh: 在 ITP/IMA（纽约大学 Tisch 艺术学院），我自 2004 年起教授名为《计算媒体导论》的课程。这个课程的起源可以追溯到 1987 年，源自
    Mike Mills 和 John Henry Thompson（Lingo 编程语言的发明者）的工作。在这门课程中，学生们学习编程基础（变量、条件语句、循环、对象、数组），以及与制作互动媒体项目相关的概念（像素、数据、声音、网络、3D
    等）。2008 年，我将这些课程材料汇编成一本入门书籍《Learning Processing》，2015 年，我制作了一系列视频教程，内容与这本书相似，不过这次是在
    JavaScript 和 p5.js 库下进行的。
- en: Once a student has learned the basics and seen an array of applications, their
    next step might be to delve deeply into a particular area. Maybe they want to
    focus on computer vision, data visualization, or generative poetry. My Nature
    of Code course (also taught at ITP/IMA since 2008) represents another possible
    next step. The course picks up exactly where my introductory material leaves off,
    demonstrating a world of programming techniques that focus on algorithms and simulation.
    The book you’re reading has evolved from that course.

    no. True, I might examine topics that come from physics or biology, but I won’t

    the book is “inspired by actual events.” I’m grabbing the parts from science and

    my approach might be, I’m still focusing on algorithms and their related programming
    techniques. Sure, the resulting demonstrations are visual (manifested as animated
    p5.js sketches), but they’re literal visualizations of the algorithms and programming
    techniques themselves, drawn only with basic shapes and grayscale color. It’s
    my hope, however, that you, dear reader, can use your creativity and visual ideas
    to make new, engaging work out of the examples. (I won’t complain if you turn

    motion of the objects will be written directly in p5.js. I’m certainly not the
    first programmer ever to consider the idea of simulating physics and life in animation,
    however, so next I’ll examine how you can use physics libraries (**[Chapter 6](ch06.xhtml#ch06)**)
    to model more sophisticated behaviors. I’ll look at the features of two libraries:
    Matter.js and Toxiclibs.js.'

    the properties of complexity. A complex system is typically defined as a system
    that’s more than the sum of its parts. While the individual elements of the system
    may be incredibly simple and easily understood, the behavior of the system as
    a whole can be highly complex, intelligent, and difficult to predict. Chasing
    complexity will lead you away from thinking purely about modeling motion and into
    the realm of rule-based systems. What can you model with cellular automata (**[Chapter
    7](ch07.xhtml#ch07)**), systems of cells living on a grid? What types of patterns
    can you generate with fractals (**[Chapter 8](ch08.xhtml#ch08)**), the geometry
    of nature?

    to computational systems (**[Chapter 9](ch09.xhtml#ch09)**) in order to evolve
    the behavior of autonomous agents? Taking inspiration from the human brain, can
    you program an artificial neural network (**[Chapter 10](ch10.xhtml#ch10)**)?

    dissected and examined. Sometimes it appears as full, stand-alone examples, other
    times it drops in as a single line or two, and often it’s stretched over whole
    sections in many short snippets, with explanations nestled in between. Whatever
    form it takes, code will always appear in a `monospaced font`. Here’s a quick
    guide on how to navigate the types of code sprinkled throughout the book.

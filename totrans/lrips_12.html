you!” he said. “Why are you running? Did you rob the bank, too?”</p><p>“What? Who are you? Let me go!” Laurie yelled.</p><p>“I’m Officer Custody, and <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> are in big trouble,” the
policeman said. “Lauren Ipsum, <span class="emphasis"><em>if</em></span> that is your real name, I arrest you on
charges!”</p><p>“What charges? What are you talking about?”</p><p>“That doesn’t matter!” Custody shouted in Laurie’s ear, shaking her
around. “Charges!”</p><p>“Ow! But <span class="emphasis"><em>what</em></span> charges?” Laurie repeated. The officer’s
hold on her was painful. People on the street were starting to point and stare. If there ever were a
time Laurie wished she could disappear like a Steganosaurus, it was now!</p><p>“You’re going to be difficult? Let’s do it nice and proper, if you
insist!” Custody took out a roll of paper and cleared his throat.</p><p>“Lauren Ipsum, you are hereby under arrest for Attempted Mythology, Counterfeiting Fair
Coins, <span class="emphasis"><em>two</em></span> counts of Impersonating a Composer, Hacking in the Third Degree, and
Miscellaneous Mopery with Intent to Creep!”</p><p>“Let me go! You’re the creep!” Laurie tried to twist away, but his grip was
too strong. Just then, a shout rang out from the crowd.</p><p>“<span class="emphasis"><em>Hey, Custody! Why are you beating up on little
girls?</em></span>”</p><p>A tough-looking woman stepped forward to confront the policeman. She wore big boots, black
gloves, and an eyepatch in the shape of a heart.</p><p>“This isn’t a girl, Losesome. This is a dangerous criminal! She broke through our
perimeter security,” Custody said.</p><p>“You mean Jane, that little old lady at the gate?” the woman asked.</p><p>“Officer Hecate, yes!”</p><p>“Come on, Custody. Jane isn’t hard to fool. Last week I told her I was Santa
Claus.” People in the crowd chuckled.</p><p>“That’s beside—”</p><p>“And what the heck is ‘Attempted Mythology’?” the woman interrupted.
“I think you just made that up.”</p><p>“What? I—”</p><p>“How do you even know you have the right person?”</p><p>“She matches the description!” Custody insisted.</p><p>“Really? She doesn’t look like Santa Claus to me!”</p><p>“<span class="emphasis"><em>No</em></span>,” he said. “She matches the description of the
hacker who came through this afternoon!”</p><p>“So you are saying a child was able to get through all of your super-duper
security?” the woman said, arching an eyebrow skeptically.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00031a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00031"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="figs/web/081fig01.png.jpg"/></div></div><p>“Well—”</p><p>“Anyway, this girl is my assistant.”</p><p>By now Custody was thoroughly confused. “This little . . . she works for
<span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span>?”</p><p>“Of course. She’s helping me test the security of this place. And if a
<span class="emphasis"><em>child</em></span> can run circles around you . . .” She shook her head.
“Let’s just say, it doesn’t look good.”</p><p>“But you’re—”</p><p>The woman said nothing. She only smiled, showing a lot of teeth.</p><p>Custody was suddenly sweating. He let go of Laurie and pulled out a handkerchief.</p><p>“Hey, now, it was an honest mistake! I didn’t know she worked for the
Col—um, you.”</p><p>“Well, now you do. And now we’re leaving. Come on, Laurel.” The woman took
Laurie by the arm and walked away, head held high.</p><p>“Let’s just walk away slowly,” the woman whispered. “When we turn the
corner, try to make it to the marina before Custody starts using his brain instead of his
mouth.”</p><p>As soon as they were out of Custody’s sight, they broke into a run.</p><p>“That was great! But my name is Laurie, not Laurel.”</p><p>“Close enough. I’m Winsome Losesome.”</p><p>“It’s nice to meet you! Thank you for helping me! I didn’t mean to cause
trouble.”</p><p>“Don’t mention it. I was leaving town anyway. And I really don’t like that
guy. He’s a dumb bully.”</p><p>At the marina, Winsome jumped aboard a boat and went to work getting it ready to depart.
“Come on! Hop on,” she called to Laurie.</p><p>“Whose boat is this, Winsome?”</p><p>“It’s my boat, the <span class="emphasis"><em>Doppelganger</em></span>. Get that other rope for me,
would you?”</p><p>“Wow, how did you get a boat? Are you a pirate?”</p><p>“I’m a lot of things, girl.” Winsome said. “As for the boat, I kind of
stole it. But I stole it honestly!”</p><p>“How can you steal something <span class="emphasis"><em>honestly</em></span>?” Laurie was afraid
that she was getting into even more trouble.</p><p>“I used to be a deckhand on this boat,” she said. “The Boss made me do all
of the dirty work. ‘Losesome, replace the main mast!’ he’d say. ‘Put a new
rigger on the widdershins!’”</p><p>Winsome unfurled the sail.</p><p>“But secretly, I was saving all the old parts I replaced. They were going to the trash
anyway, so might as well keep them, right? Once I collected enough pieces, I quit, and then I put
them back together into a boat. Boss never found out, either! The boat he has is all replacement
parts. A copy. I have the <span class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span> one.”</p><p>“But—” Laurie began.</p><p>“Think about it later, sweetie? We’re busy running from the Law.”</p><p>Winsome had a point. Laurie untied the rope, and they cast off into the moonless night.</p></div></body></html>

		<p class="noindents">Attacks against companies, and even sovereign states, have accelerated over the past decade. In 2021, hackers stole more than 100 million dollars in cryptocurrency, attempted to poison the water supply in Florida, hacked into COVID-19 vaccine producer Pfizer pharmaceuticals, attacked Colonial Pipeline using ransomware, and targeted government agencies and political activists in France, Germany, India, the Netherlands, Sweden, Ukraine, and the United Arab Emirates. Because so much of our productivity depends on technology, attacks on our technological infrastructure can have grave social and economic consequences.</p>
		<p class="indent">Understanding how to defend this infrastructure is not enough. We need more ethical hackers to help secure it. <em>Ethical hackers</em> are people who understand how to attack infrastructure, and discover vulnerabilities before they are exploited by bad actors. These ethical hackers publish new vulnerabilities in the National Vulnerability Database almost daily. Many <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxii"/>also practice responsible disclosure, notifying companies before making a vulnerability public.</p>
		<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1"><strong>Why Read This Book?</strong></h3>
		<p class="noindent">This practical guide teaches you the fundamental skills that you’ll need to become an ethical hacker. After reading this book, you should feel comfortable starting a career in penetration testing, participating in a capture-the-flag competition, and even applying for a position on a company’s red team.</p>
		<p class="indent">Each chapter introduces you to a kind of attack, explains the fundamentals of the target technology, and discusses useful tools and techniques for exploiting it. You’ll become familiar with tools like Kali Linux, Metasploit, the pyca/cryptography library, and Maltego. You’ll learn how to collect open source intelligence, scan systems and networks for vulnerabilities, write custom exploits, and design botnets.</p>
		<p class="indent">You’ll also learn how to build your own tools in the Python programming language to understand the mechanisms behind the commands hackers commonly run. By the end of this book, you should have started to think like an ethical hacker: someone who can carefully analyze systems and creatively craft ways to gain access to them.</p>
		<p class="indent">To that end, this book is for anyone who wants the learn to hack. No previous networking or computer science experience is required to understand the text’s explanations. It’s best if you have some programming experience, especially in Python. But if you’re new to programming, no worries; you’ll still find this guide instructive in its explanation of network technologies, hacking strategies, and tools. Alternatively, check out Eric Matthes’ book <em>Python Crash Course</em>, 2nd edition (No Starch, 2019), for an easy introduction to the language.</p>
		<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev2"><strong>Installing Python</strong></h3>
		<p class="noindent">The virtual machines you’ll use throughout this book come preinstalled with Python 3, so you don’t need to install Python yourself to follow along with the book’s programming projects.</p>
		<p class="indent">I strongly recommend that you develop within this virtual environment. However, if you are using an operating system that doesn’t come preinstalled with Python 3, you’ll need to install it yourself. You can download the latest version of Python 3 for your operating system by visiting <em><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a></em> and then downloading and running the installer.</p>
		<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev3"><strong>What Is in the Book?</strong></h3>
		<p class="noindent">I begin by showing you how to set up your own virtual lab environment in which you’ll execute the attacks described throughout the book. Each subsequent chapter describes a different type of attack that you could perform as you go, from connecting to the Wi-Fi network in a coffee shop to compromising the network of a large corporation.</p>
		<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxiii"/><em><strong><a href="part01.xhtml">Part I: Networking Fundamentals</a></strong></em></h4>
		<p class="noindent">This part of the book focuses on the fundamentals of networking and examines various ways in which you can attack a network. We’ll discuss the TCP protocol and architecture of the internet, in addition to numerous ways attackers exploit these technologies.</p>
		<p class="block"><strong><a href="ch01.xhtml#ch1">Chapter 1: Setting Up</a></strong> In this chapter, you’ll set up your virtual lab. Your virtual lab environment will contain five virtual machines: a router running pfSense, a Kali Linux desktop containing hacking tools, the server you’ll hack into, and two Ubuntu desktop machines.</p>
		<p class="block"><strong><a href="ch02.xhtml#ch2">Chapter 2: Capturing Traffic with ARP Spoofing</a></strong> This chapter explains how the internet transmits data and looks at how an attacker can use ARP spoofing to intercept and read a user’s unencrypted traffic. Then, we’ll use publicly available tools to execute an ARP spoofing attack in our virtual lab environment and extract the URLs of the sites a user visits. We’ll conclude with an exercise that encourages you to write your own ARP spoofing tool in Python.</p>
		<p class="block"><strong><a href="ch03.xhtml#ch3">Chapter 3: Analyzing Captured Traffic</a></strong> This chapter introduces you to the internet protocol stack and shows you how to use Wireshark to capture and analyze the packets you collected during the ARP spoofing attack. I’ll also show you how to capture the packets that flow through the firewall in your virtual environment.</p>
		<p class="block"><strong><a href="ch04.xhtml#ch4">Chapter 4: Crafting TCP Shells and Botnets</a></strong> This chapter explores the fundamentals of sockets and process communication. Then, I’ll show you how to write your own reverse shell that you can use to control a machine remotely. And although controlling one machine is great, attackers usually want to control multiple machines. So I’ll show you how this might be possible by writing a type of hacker tool called a botnet. As a case study, we’ll look at the architecture of the Mirai botnet.</p>
		<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev5"><em><strong><a href="part02.xhtml">Part II: Cryptography</a></strong></em></h4>
		<p class="noindent">In this part of the book, we’ll discuss the fundamentals of the encryption algorithms used to secure digital communications. I’ll also provide you with the background to understand how several encryption algorithms work under the hood.</p>
		<p class="block"><strong><a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5">Chapter 5: Cryptography and Ransomware</a></strong> This chapter looks at symmetric and asymmetric cryptography techniques, like one-time pads, pseudorandom generators, block ciphers, and RSA. You’ll encrypt and decrypt files and send an encrypted email. We’ll then conclude by writing our own ransomware.</p>
		<p class="block"><strong><a href="ch06.xhtml#ch6">Chapter 6: TLS and Diffie-Hellman</a></strong> This chapter focuses on secure communication, beginning with a discussion of the transport layer security (TLS) protocol. Then, I’ll explain the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm and its more secure alternative, Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxiv"/>We’ll conclude by extending the ransomware client so that it can communicate over an encrypted channel.</p>
		<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev6"><em><strong><a href="part03.xhtml">Part III: Social Engineering</a></strong></em></h4>
		<p class="noindent">In this part of the book, I’ll demonstrate how attackers use social engineering techniques and open source intelligence to trick targets into giving them undue access. In doing so, I’ll show how you can hack anyone with the proper bait.</p>
		<p class="block"><strong><a href="ch07.xhtml#ch7">Chapter 7: Phishing and Deepfakes</a></strong> This chapter discusses the fundamentals of email technologies and shows how an attacker could send a fake email. We also discuss how deepfake videos are generated and conclude by generating one of our own.</p>
		<p class="block"><strong><a href="ch08.xhtml#ch8">Chapter 8: Scanning Targets</a></strong> This chapter explores sophisticated open source intelligence collection techniques, as well as how an attacker can use Shodan and Masscan to search the entire internet for vulnerable machines. This chapter will also investigate how an attacker uses tools like Nessus and <span class="literal">nmap</span> to identify vulnerabilities in systems.</p>
		<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev7"><em><strong><a href="part04.xhtml">Part IV: Exploitation</a></strong></em></h4>
		<p class="noindent">In this part, we’ll dive into the numerous ways an attacker can exploit a vulnerability they’ve discovered. Each vulnerability is unique, but general patterns exist. We’ll look at case studies of real-world vulnerability exploitation, pointing out the patterns as we go along. We’ll also take a look at using web pages as an infection vector.</p>
		<p class="block"><strong><a href="ch09.xhtml#ch9">Chapter 9: Fuzzing for Zero-Day Vulnerabilities</a></strong> This chapter begins with a look at the OpenSSL Heartbleed vulnerability and code that can exploit it. Then, I’ll introduce the fuzzing techniques that hackers use to discover these vulnerabilities and you’ll write your own simple fuzzer. I’ll conclude by discussing other techniques, such as symbolic execution and dynamic symbolic execution.</p>
		<p class="block"><strong><a href="ch10.xhtml#ch10">Chapter 10: Building Trojans</a></strong> Trojans are malicious programs that disguise themselves as legitimate ones. We explore them by considering a second case study, the Russian malware Drovorub. Drovorub is an excellent example of modern malware, and I’ll show you how to re-create something similar using the Metasploit Framework. Then, we’ll discuss how you can create your own trojans for Linux, Windows, and Android devices and sneaky ways to hide malware.</p>
		<p class="block"><strong><a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11">Chapter 11: Building and Installing Linux Rootkits</a></strong> Once an attacker has installed malware, they often want to avoid detection. One way they can do that is by installing a rootkit, which can modify the operating system to help hide malware. In this chapter, we’ll examine how you can write your own rootkit for the Linux kernel.</p>
		<p class="block"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxv"/><strong><a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12">Chapter 12: Stealing and Cracking Passwords</a></strong> This chapter considers an attack called SQL injection and shows how a hacker can use a tool called SQLmap to inject malicious code into a web app and then extract information from the database. These databases often contain password hashes, so I’ll show you how to use John the Ripper and Hashcat to crack these hashes.</p>
		<p class="block"><strong><a href="ch13.xhtml#ch13">Chapter 13: Serious Cross-Site Scripting Exploitation</a></strong> This chapter will explore another category of a common web vulnerability, cross-site scripting, and show how an attacker can use it to inject malicious code into a target’s browser. An attacker then could use the malicious code to steal cookies or even compromise the user’s machine.</p>
		<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev8"><em><strong><a href="part05.xhtml">Part V: Controlling the Network</a></strong></em></h4>
		<p class="noindent">In the final part of the book, I’ll reveal how an attacker can go from controlling a single machine to controlling any machine on the network. I’ll also discuss the architecture and protocols used inside corporate networks and how attackers exploit them.</p>
		<p class="block"><strong><a href="ch14.xhtml#ch14">Chapter 14: Pivoting and Privilege Escalation</a></strong> This chapter looks at pivoting and how an attacker might move through a compromised firewall or router to access a private network. I’ll conclude by discussing privilege escalation techniques that allow attackers to gain root privileges by exploiting bugs in the operating system.</p>
		<p class="block"><strong><a href="ch15.xhtml#ch15">Chapter 15: Moving Through the Corporate Windows Network</a></strong> In this chapter, I’ll discuss the architecture of corporate networks and the protocols they use. We’ll look at the NTLM and Kerberos protocols in detail, as well as common attacks against these protocols, like pass-the-hash attacks and the Kerberos golden ticket attack.</p>
		<p class="block"><strong><a href="ch16.xhtml#ch16">Chapter 16: Next Steps</a></strong> In this final chapter, I’ll show you how to set up a hardened virtual private server that lets you audit systems outside your virtual lab environment. I’ll also discuss some areas of ethical hacking that I didn’t explore in this book as well as great ways to connect with the ethical hacking community.</p>

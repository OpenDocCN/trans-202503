- en: The next three chapters outline numerous examples of tabletop exercise scenarios
    that you can personalize to fit your organization. For each example, weâ€™ll provide
    a storyboard with injects and discussion questions. Keep in mind that these should
    serve only as inspiration for your tabletop exercise; you should modify these
    scenarios as needed to fit your environment and the goals and objectives of your
    exercise.

- en: In the early days, several people were working on different aspects of partnerships
    and business deals. Andy Rubin had ideas about whom to work with and how to make
    this strategy succeed. After all, he co-founded and ran a successful mobile device
    company (Danger). But there was also Android co-founder Nick Sears, recently from
    T-Mobile, who was instrumental in signing T-Mobile as the Android launch partner
    for the G1\. Hiroshi Lockheimer was crucial in partnership relationships as well,
    in project-managing the development of Android on partner devices. Rich Miner,
    another Android co-founder, had come from Orange Telecom, where he had worked
    with carriers and had run a venture fund that invested in mobile and platform
    companies (including Danger). In addition to managing the engineering teams working
    on the Android browser and speech recognition, Rich was part of the business team
    that helped make the deal for the Motorola Droid, along with Hiroshi and Tom Moss.

    come into Google on the business side. “I actually started on Android as a lawyer.
    I am the worst of everything. We destroy the world.”

    prior to Google, had been open source technology. As soon as he started, he was
    told that he’d be working on an open source project called Android, which was
    launching an SDK that Fall.

    code, to create Linux drivers that we could release. It was super complicated
    at the time because Qualcomm was scared to death of open source.”

    “I started supporting Andy on deals, and Rich Miner and some of the others as
    a lawyer. More and more, Andy would just leave me alone: ‘Here’s the deal we need.
    Go do the deal.’ Andy was busy, so he wouldn’t want to sit through all of the
    negotiations and everything.”'

    app developers, handset manufacturers, carriers, and platform software teams.
    One of the tricks with open source software is motivation; why would any of these
    partners care about the Android platform except Google? “How do you get everybody
    incentivized and invested into this ecosystem in a way that would maintain compatibility?”'

- en: Of course, app developers would care deeply about compatibility. Being able
    to run the same application across different implementations of Android would
    be a far cry better than what developers faced on platforms like Symbian and Java
    ME, where apps would frequently need to be rewritten to work across different
    devices. But the dynamics for manufacturers were different, and they were used
    to a world where they were responsible only for their own devices and implementations.

- en: Fortunately, Google had popular apps that manufacturers wanted on their devices,
    including Maps, YouTube, and the web browser. So Tom hammered out a system where
    access to those apps was an incentive for partners to maintain compatibility by
    shipping Android as-is, rather than shipping a forked version of it.^([2](#c28-footnote-2))

    into a group called New Business Development (NBD) that specialized in helping
    various Google teams on the business side. He continued working solely for Android,
    but still didn’t report into Android directly.

    there (including internationalization and keyboard support). Tom volunteered to
    help. The move made sense for him since many of the deals he worked on were in
    Asia anyway. He transferred to the Google Tokyo office and hired a team of engineers,
    missing the G1 launch that happened in California just two weeks after he moved.

- en: Meanwhile, Andy wanted to have more direct visibility into Tom’s work for Android,
    so Tom transferred to the Android team. This meant, for silly reasons related
    to Android being part of a large company, that Tom had to be reclassified as an
    engineer. “I was, I believe, the first business person at Google to move to the
    engineering ladder.^([3](#c28-footnote-3)) So I was an engineer on paper. To be
    clear, I never wrote any code.”

    buying a phone from an OEM, a handset manufacturer. But we were integral to a
    lot of these deals in terms of putting our brand or marketing either on the box,
    or the phone, or just on marketing campaigns. We set up these deals to create
    the momentum for Android. We would negotiate with the carrier. We would negotiate
    with the handset manufacturer.

    on the phone, the right apps or services, negotiate with the carrier, which was
    Docomo, negotiate with HTC. And then we worked on the marketing campaign with
    them. Monma-san [an engineer on Tom’s team] and I proofread the translations of
    the user manual in both Japanese and English and made comments and fixed the really
    silly mistakes they had, like ‘The battery was consumable,’ like you could eat
    the battery. We did everything. We did every part of everything that was necessary
    to launch a product.”

    got to the scale that it has. “There are like two billion^([4](#c28-footnote-4))
    devices out there. One company can’t build that many devices and support them
    all. Especially the variety of things: different devices that people want, different
    price points, configurations, all that kind of stuff. It’s a huge variety. By
    doing the open source thing and having one stack that supported that and having
    partners set up the factories that build out the things required—for networks
    in Turkey or whatever, the different requirements—one company can’t take all of
    that on. There are different requirements in different regions. We scaled that
    by having different companies pick that up and take that on.”'

- en: In [Chapter 29](chapter29.xhtml), I demonstrated how to build, access, and update
    arrays and hash tables. These data structures, not often associated with bat files,
    are great applications of the equally atypical real-world Batch objects discussed
    in [Chapter 33](chapter33.xhtml).

    object bat file for each data structure.

    and the method or action being invoked; depending on the method, another argument
    or two might be required. You can add elements to the end of an array or at a
    specific index; you can retrieve the first element, the next element, or an element
    at a particular index. The object has methods for removing an element at a certain
    index, getting the size of the array, and clearing or emptying the array. You
    can get the index of the first instance of a specific value or retrieve a boolean
    telling you whether that value exists anywhere in the array. You can even clone
    or copy the array.'

- en: There are, however, a few interesting bits of code worthy of mention. You’ll
    find plenty of examples of delayed expansion in this listing. In fact, a couple
    methods use nested for commands solely because of delayed expansion; each for
    command transforms a variable assigned in the outer for command into a variable
    resolvable with percent signs ([Chapter 20](chapter20.xhtml)). Also, the :IndexOf
    and :Contains methods perform similar functions. Instead of duplicating work,
    the latter calls the former, converting the result into a boolean. Likewise, multiple
    methods retrieve the array size by calling :GetSize. The :Clone method assigns
    all variables associated with one array to another, taking advantage of text replacement
    and the fact that array elements are thinly disguised ordinary variables.

  zh: 此对象还接受至少两个参数：哈希表的名称和正在调用的方法或操作。您可以通过调用:Put方法向数据结构添加键值对，并通过:Get方法获取给定键的值。其他方法可以清空整个哈希表或仅移除一个键值对。您可以获取键值对的数量，并检索一个布尔值，显示键或值是否存在，并且像数组对象一样，还有一个克隆方法。
- en: Each method and its corresponding parameters are described in the comments at
    the beginning of the bat file. The most interesting method is :ContainsValue,
    which preemptively sets the boolean to false before performing a search for the
    value by looking at every pair. However, determining whether a key exists in the
    hash table requires little more than an if defined.

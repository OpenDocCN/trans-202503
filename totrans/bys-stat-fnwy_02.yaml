    formal process we use to update our beliefs about the world once we’ve observed
    some data. We’ll work through a scenario and explore how we can map our everyday
    experience to Bayesian reasoning.

    this book! Bayesian statistics is closely aligned with how people naturally use
    evidence to create new beliefs and reason about everyday problems; the tricky

    one.

    quantify probability. For now, though, we won’t use any math or models; we’ll
    just get you familiar with the basic concepts and use our intuition to determine
    probabilities. Then, in the next chapter, we’ll put exact numbers to probabilities.
    Throughout the rest of the book, you’ll learn how we can use rigorous mathematical
    techniques to formally model and reason about the concepts we’ll cover in this
    chapter.

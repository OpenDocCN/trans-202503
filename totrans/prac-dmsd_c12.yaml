- en: In some of the more radical flavors of survivalist lore, no sin is as grave
    as letting others know that you prep. The thinking is that the unwashed masses
    are irredeemable and destined to perish in the wake of The Event, so there’s no
    need to trouble yourself with helping them; as for survivalists who spill the
    beans, they’ll undoubtedly have to fend off angry mobs clamoring for a share of
    their supplies. Moved by such visions, many newcomers to the community go to great
    lengths to conceal their hobby—not just from neighbors or relatives, but also
    from delivery people, banks, and other perceived prying eyes.

    come of posting selfies with gold bars or wads of cash, and in a widespread and
    profound downturn, the number of souls a single person can help is limited. But
    in trying times, people almost always come together and find strength in local
    communities. It’s much better to be a part of a resilient group than a lone warrior
    trying to take on the world. Given the localized nature of most disasters, it’s
    also better if your group consists of neighbors, coworkers, and relatives, rather
    than a scattered collection of internet strangers who live hundreds of miles apart.'

    is a fantastic opportunity to make friends and support neighbors in small ways;
    it would be a shame to barricade the door the moment the lights go out, anticipating
    that they might never come back on. It’s also good to remember that most disasters
    don’t unfold precisely as planned. If you break a leg in the midst of the commotion,
    or if your supplies are damaged or spoiled, having self-sufficient kindred spirits
    you can turn to can make all the difference in the world.

- en: 'I suspect the reason some members of the prepping community are so insular
    is that they don’t feel taken seriously by the outside world. The obligatory and
    harmless joke uttered by many outsiders—“Oh, you’re a prepper. I know where to
    go if I need anything!”—is taken as a genuine threat. Some of the difficulties
    the prepared encounter have to do with the lingering toxic influence of TV series
    such as *Doomsday Preppers*, but some of the pain is clearly self-inflicted: when
    survivalists unload fringe critiques of fractional reserve banking or their theories
    of nuclear warfare onto an uninitiated audience, it’s hard to blame the other
    party if all they can come back with is a blank stare or an off-the-cuff joke.'

- en: My favorite approach to getting folks interested in emergency preparedness isn’t
    to school them on how they should be living their lives or to bury them in data,
    but to casually bring up a perilous experience lived by a common friend, or to
    mention a regional disaster that happened some weeks back. Then, rather than giving
    my conversation partner unsolicited advice, I ask them how they feel about it,
    and if there’s anything we could conceivably do to protect our families. If they
    laugh it off, I might try once more some time later, perhaps bringing up one of
    the simple steps I decided to take, but then leave it at that. The goal isn’t
    to convert; it’s to plant the seed of rational doubt about their current approach
    to managing risk. It can be months before the seed takes hold, and if it never
    does, that’s fine. Not prepping is a rational choice too.

- en: Beyond building a network of like-minded individuals interested in disaster
    preparedness, cultivating neighborly relationships throughout your community in
    a more basic way is also worthwhile. In a crisis that overwhelms hospitals, for
    instance, being on good terms with a veterinarian or a physician can help avoid
    misery or even save a life. For introverts and extroverts alike, it pays to say
    hi to neighbors, engage in small talk, and offer to help with minor hurdles every
    now and then; finding common interests is a powerful bonding method too. I figure
    that even if the zombie apocalypse never comes, such gestures can’t be a waste
    of time.

The concept, as well as the organization and early drafts of the chapters, were created by both authors. But after publishers were found (one for the French edition and one for the English edition) and the editing process began, Karine became pregnant and decided that motherhood was her first priority. Olivier offered her his full support and took over the majority of book-related responsibilities after that. In the end, Karine wrote <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Drawing and Illustration">Chapter 3</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Designing a Website">Chapter 8</a>, and Olivier wrote the rest. Karine gave birth to a healthy, happy girl named Lina, and one year later she gave birth to a second baby girl, Sophie.</p><p>Karine is a freelance consultant in web development and lives in Mérignac, near Bordeaux, France. She has a master’s degree in computer science, with a specialization in image and sound, and she has collaborated on the GIMP development project in various ways.</p><p>Olivier is a professor emeritus in computer science at the University of Nice, France. He has a doctorate and a Thèse d’État in computer science. He has been a professor at the Universities of Grenoble, Montréal, Lausanne, and Nice and has taught many aspects of computer science, including algorithmics, programming, data structures, compiling, programming language fundamentals, and graphics processing. He lives in Grasse, a lovely town in the hills of the French Riviera, and several of the photographs used as examples in this book were taken from his house or in his garden.</p></div></body></html>

    with programming. The goal of this book is to guide you in helping the children
    in your life learn programming—and, in the process, learn to design projects,
    solve problems, reason systematically, and express themselves creatively.

    to introduce Scratch and its active online community. In [Appendix A](text00012.html#app01)

- en: We have worked hard to bring coding to young children in a developmentally appropriate
    way. It is our strong belief that programming opens new ways of thinking and new
    forms of expression. We hope to continue making improvements to ScratchJr and
    creating new resources and opportunities for learning and sharing. We want ScratchJr
    to remain free so anyone, anywhere, can use it. So far, we have been able to do
    so through generous grants from the National Science Foundation and the Scratch
    Foundation. If you believe in our vision and want to support us, please consider
    making a donation to the Scratch Foundation ( *[http://www.scratchfoundation.org/](http://www.scratchfoundation.org/)*
    ). Any amount, large or small, is appreciated.

<p class="noindent">At 12:01 <small>AM</small>, the door squeaked open and a guard poked his head into the dark prison cell. He scanned the room slowly with a torch, until his gaze landed on the sleeping prisoner.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Master?” called the guard softly.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The prisoner stirred, sat up, and looked at the guard.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Master, I—” started the guard, but he broke off with a strangled gasp.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank waved at him from the prison bed.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The guard turned to run, but Notation stepped into the doorway holding a large crossbow.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I . . . I was just doing my rounds,” said the guard.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank grunted a laugh and shook his head. “Hand over the torch. Slowly,” he instructed. “My friend here just graduated from the police academy, and I’m told she scored top marks in crossbow usage.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I was second, actually,” said Notation from the doorway.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank sighed. “Really? This is the one time you decide to be modest?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Sorry. I just wanted to be accurate.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“It’s a threat, Notation. You’re allowed to embellish threats.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_232"/>“Sorry,” she repeated.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Anyway, the point remains. She has a crossbow and knows how to use it better than all but one of her classmates. Please hand over the torch.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The guard’s eyes darted around the room, searching for an escape. Finding none, he slowly leaned forward and offered the torch to Frank. As Frank reached for it, the guard shifted and swung it at his head. The fire hissed through the air.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank leaned left to avoid the flaming tip. The guard pivoted for another swing, but Frank stood and plucked the torch from his hands as Notation shoved the guard from behind. He stumbled and fell in an awkward heap on the bed.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank shook his head. “Obvious move, kid,” he said. “Trying to hit me with a torch. Awful execution. Didn’t even come close. I’ll give you credit for trying, though.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The guard blinked dumbly back at Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Now take off that stupid mask. We know it’s you, Socks.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Socks? Who is that? I’ve never heard of anyone named Socks,” said the guard, completely unconvincingly.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Socks, take off the mask,” repeated Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The guard hesitated for a moment before reaching behind his neck and undoing a clasp. A strange whirling sound filled the cell as his face melted and reformed into an elaborate mask. The guard then lowered the mask from his face to reveal Socks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“How did you know?” asked Socks.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0232-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Many little things,” said Frank. “First, you followed us, but didn’t reveal yourself until the Vinettees had us cornered. They have a fierce reputation <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_233"/>but aren’t the most clever gang when it comes to gloating to their prisoners. They posed the real threat of accidentally revealing your plans. But your story was pathetic enough to be believable.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Your actions on Frayed Cable Island were less believable, though. It was your dropped staff that destroyed the evidence. You appeared stymied by the gate outside the prison, but immediately seized upon a metal-weakening spell when your own life was in danger. You even used the Spell of Accelerated Rusting, the very same spell that was used during the attack on the convoy.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“You also refused to help pick the lock outside the prison until I suggested climbing over it alone,” added Notation. “I’m guessing you wanted to be there if we found the papers.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Why not confront me then?” asked Socks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I still wasn’t sure who to trust,” admitted Frank. He gestured toward Notation, who still stood at the door holding the crossbow. “Notation caught on a little faster. She told me that she started to suspect you after the prison, but didn’t have anything solid. When I suggested the parallelized search, it prevented her from keeping tabs on you.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I honestly thought Frank suggested the parallelized search to get you out of the way for a while,” Notation admitted.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank decided never to mention that the goal had been to get them <em>both</em> out of his way. At that point, he had been more suspicious of Notation than of Socks. He’d suggested the parallelized search so he could follow up on the threads alone.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I have to admit,” continued Frank, “your acting during the whole prison episode was pretty good. I actually thought someone had jumped you. At the time, it bothered me that the attacker hadn’t stuck around, but I ignored my gut. I should have seen it sooner.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“One thing I don’t understand, though, is why you closed the door. Why not just ‘trip’ and drop your staff?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Socks shrugged. “The door was an accident. I didn’t mean to lock us in. My sleeve got caught on the door as I pretended to trip.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_234"/>“You played it off well, though,” said Frank. “And trapping us certainly helped sell the attack story.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Socks shrugged, but pride flashed across his face.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“But most of all, it was your shortcuts with the binary search tree,” said Frank. “Anyone who studies binary search trees knows enough to start at the root when inserting nodes. Your mistake meant that either you weren’t the expert you claimed to be or you were trying to sabotage the tree.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Socks smiled. “Not bad,” he said. “I thought my incompetent wizard act would be enough to throw you off.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“You were good,” conceded Frank. “Good enough to make me repeatedly overlook the obvious.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Thank you,” said Socks. “I did a few seasons of Babbageville community theater back at school.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“It shows,” said Frank. “I’m guessing that’s why you were the one chosen to impersonate the new transfer when you robbed the record offices. Although I have to admit, I never figured out exactly whom you had chosen to impersonate.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I used whomever suited the task. There were so many new transfers to choose from.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank nodded. It made sense. “Too bad the station doesn’t keep records of prison cell assignments. I’m guessing you cleared the shelves that could have contained anything about assignments, cell assignments, Exponentious, notices, prison, prisoners, and room assignments. You stole all those documents for nothing.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“It was worth a try,” said Socks. “There’s a lot of cells here. But how did you know I was going after the prison? I didn’t even mention it.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank smiled. “You weren’t subtle in your tip about an attack on the castle,” he explained. “You were trying to draw security away from the prison—not a bad plan. I might have missed the prison option if I hadn’t chatted with Dr. Loop.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Socks scowled at the mention of Dr. Loop’s name. “Her? She’s been a thorn in the side of evil wizards for years. Do you know that she <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_235"/>helped Marcus design the prison’s security? Who puts a Spell of Mild Nausea in the hallways? That’s just mean.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“It doesn’t seem so bad,” Notation chimed in. “They give the guards antinausea charms, and the prisoners are safe as long as they’re with the guards or in their rooms.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I threw up twice already,” countered Socks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“You were breaking in! That’s why—” started Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank cut in, “Where are your accomplices, Socks?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“He’s alone,” said Notation before Socks could answer.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“What?” Frank looked at her. “How do you know that?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“There’s another six-pen ArrayCart parked outside,” she answered. “I have no idea why he would use the same cart, but it’s out there and it’s empty. If he was working with others, someone would be guarding it or waiting to make a getaway.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Socks shrugged. “Only one of us could use the mask to sneak into the prison itself, and large groups hanging around outside a prison are generally considered suspicious. So I volunteered to come alone.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Where can I find your friends?” asked Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Socks laughed. “You won’t need to find <em>them</em>, Mr. Runtime. Once news of my capture gets out, they’ll find <em>you</em>. You’ve made some powerful enemies tonight.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Oh, really?” said Frank. “I seem to be good at making enemies. Perhaps you can give me their names, and I can add them to my fan club. Is Gretchen in on it too?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Socks laughed. “Gretchen? You actually still think I’m her apprentice? After you two revealed all the other lies?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Then who’s behind this?” asked Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“The League of Unnecessary Complexity,” answered Frank. Mentally he added, “which apparently does not include a wizard named Gretchen.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I’m impressed, Mr. Runtime,” said Socks. “Not many people know about our little organization.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“The League of Unnecessary Complexity?” asked Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_236"/>“They’re involved with the wizard Exponentious: followers, accomplices, or maybe just admirers,” Frank explained.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Exponentious!” exclaimed Notation. “The evil wizard? Isn’t he in prison for trying to destroy the <em>whole kingdom</em>?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Yeah, that’s him—the really bad wizard. Didn’t I mention he was the one Socks was going to rescue?” asked Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notation glared back at him.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“You misunderstand,” said Socks. “The kingdom wouldn’t be in ruins. It would have been saved. Once Exponentious comes to power, we’ll witness a new golden age. He—”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“He’s insane,” interrupted Frank. “He would have ruined the kingdom.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Off to the side Notation nodded in agreement. “I have to agree with Frank on this one.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Socks’s eyes shone with fury. He jumped to his feet, flinging back his cloak. He swung up his staff and began chanting a long incantation, whirling the staff in a complex pattern. Socks pointed the staff directly at Frank and finished the spell.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank watched calmly as absolutely nothing happened. Notation rolled her eyes.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Done now?” Frank asked. “You have to know magic doesn’t work in here.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Yeah. I just—” Socks started, slumped in defeat. He broke off suddenly and bolted for the door. Before Notation could fire, Socks swung his staff at the crossbow. She stepped out of range and repositioned the crossbow, mildly disappointed at the pathetic escape attempt. At the same time, Frank grabbed the back of Socks’s robe and pulled him to a stop. The kid’s arms windmilled as he fought to break free.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">With a grunt, Frank heaved on the robe and Socks stumbled back into the cell, toppling onto the bed. Frank crouched to retrieve the fallen staff. It was useless for magic, but could still raise a nasty welt. Then he strode out. As soon as he was clear, Notation slammed the door.</p>&#13;

    work on tools. To begin with, Xav dove into DDMS.^([4](#c24-footnote-4)) DDMS
    was a tool running on a developer’s desktop system that was a container for many
    different tools. For example, DDMS provided a list of the current applications
    running on an Android device connected to the host computer. Selecting one of
    these would cause that application to connect to port 8700 on the host computer,
    at which point you could debug that application by connecting to that port from
    a debugging tool.

    native memory. This isn’t a particularly critical need for most Android developers,
    but it was very important at the time for the Android platform team itself. After
    that project, he refactored the monolithic DDMS tool into separate pieces consisting
    of the core functionality, the user interface layer, and the glue that tied the
    other two together into a standalone tool.

- en: By refactoring DDMS, Xav was able to connect the pieces with an existing open
    source development IDE called Eclipse. By June, he was able to demonstrate, to
    the larger Android team, the entire workflow of opening up an application project
    within this IDE, compiling it, deploying it to the emulator, running it on the

  zh: 对于 Android（以及许多其他平台）来说，“参考文档”往往是由编写 API 和底层功能的工程师来编写的。也就是说，如果一位工程师添加了一个名为 Thingie
    的类，那么他们会（或应该^([14](#c24-footnote-14))) 编写一种概述文档，说明这个类的用途以及为什么开发者应该关注它。Thingie
    类中的函数也会（或应该）有文档，描述何时以及如何调用这些函数。
- en: But reference docs get you only so far. It’s great to be able to go to the docs
    for, say, the Activity class and learn how to use it. But how did you learn enough
    to even know to look for Activity? What developers really need, especially for
    a new platform like Android, is some higher-level documentation, giving an overview
    and teaching the fundamentals. What is this platform? How do we write apps for
    it? Where is sample code that we can look at to see how it is done?

  zh: 但参考文档只能帮你走到一定程度。能够查阅文档，了解如何使用例如 Activity 类，固然很棒。但是你是怎么学会足够的知识，甚至知道要查找 Activity
    的呢？开发者们真正需要的，特别是对于像 Android 这样的新平台，是一些更高层次的文档，提供概述并教授基础知识。这个平台是什么？我们如何为它编写应用？在哪里可以找到示例代码，看看是如何做的？

  zh: Android SDK 将在 2007 年 11 月发布。在此之前的三个月，团队决定他们需要一位技术写作人员，并请来了 Dirk Dougherty。
- en: Dirk had been working at Openwave, a company that made a browser for mobile
    phones. A former colleague forwarded his resume to the Android team. Dirk interviewed
    and started a few weeks later.

    lobby, the one that later would become the arcade.^([15](#c24-footnote-15)) There
    were a bunch of tables stashed in there that were all empty. I didn’t know what
    was going on, or if I was in the right place. Eventually, in came Jason, Dan,
    Dick, David, and Quang, who were starting up what would become the DevRel^([16](#c24-footnote-16))
    team. We all moved in there and started learning about the platform. Someone drew
    a countdown calendar on our whiteboard with the number of days until the SDK launch,
    and right from then we started pushing toward the launch.”

    和 Quang 进来了，他们正组建即将成为 DevRel^([16](#c24-footnote-16)) 团队的成员。我们都搬进了那里，开始学习这个平台。有人在我们的白板上画了一个倒计时日历，显示
    SDK 发布的天数，从那时起我们就开始朝着发布目标推进。”
- en: Dirk and the DevRel team pulled together the pieces that the SDK needed. “The
    first year was just constantly sprinting to get the website up, to get the basic
    documentation in place. It was mostly reference docs and tooling, combined with
    a few guides and API tutorials. We had ongoing preview releases and SDK updates
    as the platform stabilized. With the Developer Challenge and the intense developer
    interest, we needed to expand the docs. I got help from an external writer I’d
    worked with,^([17](#c24-footnote-17)) who partnered with me to write the Android
    fundamentals docs, explaining how all this stuff worked. A few months later, we
    got more reinforcements as another internal writer joined the effort, Scott Main.
    We spent all of our time creating the fundamentals to go around the reference
    docs, and then bringing up the website. The engineering team gave us tons of support
    along the way. Getting things off the ground was a total team effort.”^([18](#c24-footnote-18))

  zh: Dirk 和 DevRel 团队整理了 SDK 所需的各个部分。“第一年我们基本上是在不断冲刺，搭建网站，完成基本的文档编写。大部分是参考文档和工具，再加上一些指南和
    API 教程。随着平台稳定，我们发布了持续的预览版本和 SDK 更新。由于开发者挑战赛和开发者们的强烈兴趣，我们需要扩展文档。我得到了一个我曾合作过的外部作家的帮助，^([17](#c24-footnote-17))
    他与我合作撰写了 Android 基础文档，解释这些东西是如何工作的。几个月后，我们得到了更多的增援，另一个内部作家 Scott Main 加入了我们的工作。我们把所有的时间都花在了围绕参考文档构建基础文档，然后再搭建网站。整个工程团队也给予了我们巨大的支持。项目启动是一个完全的团队合作过程。”^([18](#c24-footnote-18))

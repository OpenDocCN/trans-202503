- en: '*Email* is electronic mail that you can send and receive using your computer.
    There are many advantages to email: it’s free to send and receive regardless of
    the message length; it’s instant; and you can send pictures, videos, links to
    interesting websites, and much more. Millions of people around the world rely
    on email for their daily correspondence. And because so many people use email,
    it’s likely that many of your friends and family are already using it, making
    it a simple way to keep in touch with people you know.'
  prefs: []

- en: Many apps and email services refer to emails as “messages,” so if you see the
    term *message* instead of *email*, just know that it’s often the same thing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Like with traditional mail, to send an email you need to know *where* to send
    it. This is where email addresses come in: an *email address* is a unique address
    that ensures your email goes precisely to the right person. This also means that
    people can contact you at your email address without worrying that their email
    has gone to the wrong person. An email address might look like this: *[chrisewin@outlook.com](mailto:chrisewin@outlook.com)*.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All email addresses have an @ symbol (pronounced “at”) in the middle. The part
    before the @ symbol is your unique address name, which you choose when setting
    up your email account. The part after the @ symbol is the email provider you’re
    using. For example, Google email addresses end in *[@gmail.com](mailto:@gmail.com)*,
    and Microsoft email addresses end in *[@outlook.com](mailto:@outlook.com)*.

    follow along with the chapter. If you followed the steps in “[Setting Up Your
    Computer](ch00.xhtml#toc_lev17)” on [page 17](ch00.xhtml#page_17), you’ll already
    have a Microsoft account with an email address that ends in *[@outlook.com](mailto:@outlook.com)*.
    If not, consult “[Switching to a Microsoft Account](app02.xhtml#app02)” on [page
    297](app02.xhtml#page_297) to check whether you have a Microsoft account and then
    set one up if you do not.

- en: Windows 10 includes the built-in Mail app, which makes sending and receiving
    emails easier. If you’ve used an older Windows computer, you may be familiar with
    Windows Live Mail or Outlook Express, which are also email programs. The Mail
    app performs a similar function, but its layout is quite different from Live Mail
    and Outlook Express. There are other ways to use email with web-based email managers
    such as Gmail and Hotmail, but to keep things simple, we’ll focus on the Mail
    app.

    from, their emails if you don’t want to receive their ads. Just click the link
    in the email that reads “Unsubscribe.” It often appears at the bottom of the email.

- en: While email is a convenient way to keep in touch with your friends and family
    members, scammers might use emails to try to trick you into giving them your financial
    details or into installing a virus on your computer. They might attempt this by
    pretending to be a bank or a legitimate company, asking you to click a link or
    provide personal information. However, a real bank would *never* ask for information
    via email. If you’re concerned that an email from a bank might be a scam, contact
    the bank directly (not using the contact details provided in the email) to confirm.
    For more information about staying safe with emails, jump forward to [Lesson 14](ch14.xhtml#ch14).

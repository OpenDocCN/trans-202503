- en: Attacks against companies, and even sovereign states, have accelerated over
    the past decade. In 2021, hackers stole more than 100 million dollars in cryptocurrency,
    attempted to poison the water supply in Florida, hacked into COVID-19 vaccine
    producer Pfizer pharmaceuticals, attacked Colonial Pipeline using ransomware,
    and targeted government agencies and political activists in France, Germany, India,
    the Netherlands, Sweden, Ukraine, and the United Arab Emirates. Because so much
    of our productivity depends on technology, attacks on our technological infrastructure
    can have grave social and economic consequences.

- en: Understanding how to defend this infrastructure is not enough. We need more
    ethical hackers to help secure it. *Ethical hackers* are people who understand
    how to attack infrastructure, and discover vulnerabilities before they are exploited
    by bad actors. These ethical hackers publish new vulnerabilities in the National
    Vulnerability Database almost daily. Many also practice responsible disclosure,
    notifying companies before making a vulnerability public.

- en: This practical guide teaches you the fundamental skills that you’ll need to
    become an ethical hacker. After reading this book, you should feel comfortable
    starting a career in penetration testing, participating in a capture-the-flag
    competition, and even applying for a position on a company’s red team.

- en: Each chapter introduces you to a kind of attack, explains the fundamentals of
    the target technology, and discusses useful tools and techniques for exploiting
    it. You’ll become familiar with tools like Kali Linux, Metasploit, the pyca/cryptography
    library, and Maltego. You’ll learn how to collect open source intelligence, scan
    systems and networks for vulnerabilities, write custom exploits, and design botnets.

    to understand the mechanisms behind the commands hackers commonly run. By the
    end of this book, you should have started to think like an ethical hacker: someone
    who can carefully analyze systems and creatively craft ways to gain access to
    them.'

    networking or computer science experience is required to understand the text’s
    explanations. It’s best if you have some programming experience, especially in
    Python. But if you’re new to programming, no worries; you’ll still find this guide
    instructive in its explanation of network technologies, hacking strategies, and
    tools. Alternatively, check out Eric Matthes’ book *Python Crash Course*, 2nd
    edition (No Starch, 2019), for an easy introduction to the language.

    a router running pfSense, a Kali Linux desktop containing hacking tools, the server
    you’ll hack into, and two Ubuntu desktop machines.'

    explains how the internet transmits data and looks at how an attacker can use
    ARP spoofing to intercept and read a user’s unencrypted traffic. Then, we’ll use
    publicly available tools to execute an ARP spoofing attack in our virtual lab
    environment and extract the URLs of the sites a user visits. We’ll conclude with
    an exercise that encourages you to write your own ARP spoofing tool in Python.'

    show you how to capture the packets that flow through the firewall in your virtual
    environment.'

    explores the fundamentals of sockets and process communication. Then, I’ll show
    you how to write your own reverse shell that you can use to control a machine
    remotely. And although controlling one machine is great, attackers usually want
    to control multiple machines. So I’ll show you how this might be possible by writing
    a type of hacker tool called a botnet. As a case study, we’ll look at the architecture
    of the Mirai botnet.'

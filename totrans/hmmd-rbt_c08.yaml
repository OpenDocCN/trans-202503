- en: Barreller Bot has seemingly eternal forward propulsion in a given direction.
    Put simply, it has a motor that acts as an off-centered weight inside a can. When
    gravity pulls the weight (that is, the motor) down, the can rolls forward. A normal
    can would likely stop rolling at that point, but this can has a tilt switch that
    turns the motor on when it drops, causing the motor to rotate back upward (and
    turn off again), which restarts the process. If you can imaginethis happening
    really quickly and for a sustained amount of time, you’ll understand what this
    bot does. The Barreller has the appearance of rolling forward on its own and even
    doing seemingly impossible things like rolling up inclines. This bot is great
    fun. If you don’t believe me, build one for yourself. It’s quick and easy to do.

- en: The Barreller is built inside a paint can (I used a clear novelty can). Before
    you do anything, make sure you have modified the continuous servo motor for direct
    drive (Chapter 4) or are using one of the geared motor alternatives, as outlined
    in Appendix A. Once that is complete, the next step is building the inner “weight”
    mechanism, which is essentially a circuit consisting of a motor, battery pack,
    and tilt switch. You’ll insert this mechanism into the can and attach it to the
    center.

    handles.![f08002](image_fi/500235c08/f08002.png)

    tie with the batteries facing down. Place the motor on top of the battery holder
    so that the servo horn sticks off perpendicularly in one direction and the wooden
    handles are sticking off in the opposite direction. Zip-tie everything firmly
    together until it is one singular unit and won’t pull apart.![f08003](image_fi/500235c08/f08003.png)

    the battery holder and solder the connection. Solder the red wire from the battery
    holder to the little spike that sticks out of the tilt switch. Solder the red
    wire from the motor to the conductive metallic shell of the tilt switch. When
    the tilt switch is activated, electricity will flow between the spike and the
    outer shell.![f08004](image_fi/500235c08/f08004.png)

    such that it is parallel with them. However, make certain this doesn’t short out
    the switch. If you are concerned about this, you can cover it with shrink tube
    (not pictured).

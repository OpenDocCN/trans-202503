little hill, she ended up at . . . Recursion Junction!</p><p>“Is this the same place, Xor?” Laurie asked. “It looks like
it.”</p><p>“Try a right turn,” he said.</p><p>She did, but after a short while they were back where they started. When she tried a second,
and a third, and twenty-seventh time, they always came back to Recursion Junction.</p><p>“It seems as though I am going somewhere else, but we always come back to the same
place. What’s going on?” Laurie wondered.</p><div class="literallayout"><p>They went around . . .<br/>
  . . . and around . . .<br/>
    . . . and around . . .<br/>
      . . . and around so many times that Laurie lost count.</p></div><p>Just as she was about to give up, there was a gigantic smashing sound, like a stack of plates
falling to the floor.</p><p>They both jumped in fright, and for a moment Xor accidentally turned the same color as
Laurie’s shirt. They looked around for the source of the noise but couldn’t find it. To
their surprise, the next turn put them on a different road.</p><p>This road was neat and straight, and it seemed to stretch on forever. Up ahead, a man in a
Greek helmet was riding on a large Round Green animal with a Shell. (Eponymous might have called the
creature a <span class="emphasis"><em>turtle</em></span>, though she wouldn’t have been quite right.) The two
were moving slowly and steadily away.</p><p>“Hey! Wait!” Laurie shouted, running up to them.</p><p>“At last, someone has caught up to us!” said the animal.</p><p>“I thought that was <span class="emphasis"><em>impossible</em></span>,” said the man.</p><p>“Hello!” the animal said to Laurie. “I am Tortoise, a humble
tortoise.” He was much too large to be a mere <span class="emphasis"><em>turtle</em></span>. “This is my
esteemed companion, Achilles the Logician.”</p><p>“At your service, miss!” said Achilles, bowing to her from his perch atop
Tortoise.</p><p>“Um, hello. My name is Lauren Ipsum.” She attempted a curtsey.</p><p>“How did you get here, Miss Ipsum?” asked Tortoise.</p><p>“I don’t really know,” Laurie said. “We were following the path to
Symbol, but I got turned around at Recursion Junction.”</p><p>“That often happens. You spent quite a bit of time chasing your tail, I
imagine.”</p><p>“But I don’t have a tail,” she said.</p><p>“So it got away from you, did it?”</p><p>“What?” Laurie asked. “No, I don’t—”</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00010a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00010"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="figs/web/029fig01.png.jpg"/></div></div><p>“Or perhaps it was optimized away,” said Tortoise. “No matter. Most of you
made it through, and that’s the important thing. You can help us resolve a
question.”</p><p>“Well, I can try,” Laurie said, not sure that she and Tortoise were having the
same conversation.</p><p>“Splendid!” said Tortoise. “The question my dear friend Achilles and I are
considering is this: how long is an infinite piece of string?”</p><p>“An infinite string? Infinite means it’s really, really, really, really, really,
<span class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> long. Really,” said Laurie. Really.</p><p>“Ah! So you agree with <span class="emphasis"><em>me</em></span>,” Achilles said. “That means
the burden of proof must be borne by the other side.”</p><p>“The burden of Achilles on my <span class="emphasis"><em>back</em></span> is more than enough!”
Tortoise grumbled.</p><p>“Friend Tortoise is wise about many things,” said Achilles. “But he is
clearly wrong this time. He says that an infinite string can be exactly <span class="emphasis"><em>two
inches</em></span> long!”</p><p>“But how can an infinite string be two inches long?” Laurie asked.</p><p>“His claim is preposterous and indiscrete,” said Achilles. “We are in
continuous disagreement about it.”</p><p>“I never disagree,” said Tortoise. “I only discuss, especially with an
intellect such as yours, Achilles. Your understanding has no limit.”</p><p>“You are too kind, dear Tortoise.”</p><p>“I mean every word,” said Tortoise. “Allow me to suggest a way to settle the
question by Experiment.”</p><p>“Please, suggest away,” said Achilles.</p><p>“Let us build—hypothetically, of course!—an infinitely long piece of string
and then measure it. Miss Ipsum can be our impartial judge.”</p><p>“I accept. Experiment is always better than mere Theory,” Achilles said.
“And an impartial judge sounds wonderful, especially when she already agrees with
me!”</p><p>“Excellent,” said Tortoise. “Miss Ipsum, imagine you have an infinite number
of pieces of string. If you laid them all end-to-end, would that be infinitely long?
Hypothetically?”</p><p>“Yes, it must be,” said Laurie.</p><p>“Infinity is infinity,” said Achilles. “It’s only
logical.”</p><p>“I wonder. Suppose we start with a piece of string <span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> inch
long,” Tortoise said. “Then add a second piece of string that is
<span class="emphasis"><em>one-half</em></span> inch long. How long are they together?”</p><p>“One and a half inches,” Laurie said.</p><p>“And that is shorter than two inches?” Tortoise asked.</p><p>“One-half inch shorter. Unmistakably,” Achilles said.</p><p>“We all agree thus far,” said Tortoise. “Perhaps we shall converge upon the
same conclusion.”</p><p>“I doubt that!” said Achilles. Laurie wasn’t sure what Tortoise was getting
at, but she doubted it, too.</p><p>“Achilles, would you please keep count of our hypothetical string? I want to add a third
piece <span class="emphasis"><em>one-quarter</em></span> of an inch long,” said Tortoise. “Is our string
now one and three-quarters inches long?”</p><p>Achilles retrieved a much-used notebook from under his helmet and scribbled some figures.
“It seems so,” he said.</p><p>“With one-quarter inch to spare?” asked Tortoise.</p><p>“Yes,” replied Achilles. “Only one-quarter inch! You are a finger’s
width away from defeat!”</p><p>“Add an <span class="emphasis"><em>eighth</em></span>-inch piece,” Tortoise said. “Do I still
have some space left over?”</p><p>“Yes, but I’ll have beaten you soon!” the Greek Logician crowed. “Your
string is an eighth of an inch away from the limit, and you’ve done only
<span class="emphasis"><em>four</em></span> pieces!”</p><p>“Your arithmetic is correct as always, Achilles. But in the interest of science, let us
continue until the bitter end,” Tortoise said.</p><p>“It won’t be long,” said Achilles. “What is your next
move?”</p><p>“I would like to add another piece of string, this time one-sixteenth inch
long.”</p><p>“Done!” Achilles scribbled away. “Only one-sixteenth inch left, old
friend!”</p><p>“Only that much?” said Tortoise. “Then for the next one, I would like to add
a piece of string one thirty-second inch long.”</p><p>“As you wish, poor Tortoise. One thirty-second of an inch added. There is only one
thirty-second inch remaining, and an infinity of strings to go! There will be
<span class="emphasis"><em>plenty</em></span> of rope left to trip yourself with!” said Achilles.</p><p>“Please add a sixty-fourth-inch piece of string,” said Tortoise, “then a
one-hundred-twenty-eighth-inch piece, and a two-hundred-and-fifty-sixth-inch piece, and then a
five-hundred-twelfth-inch piece, and then—”</p><p>“Slow down, Tortoise! You are going too fast,” Achilles said. “And those are
very big—no, very <span class="emphasis"><em>small</em></span> numbers.” He figured and scribbled for a
minute. “There is only a five-hundred-and-twelfth inch remaining. It’s too bad
we’re not splitting <span class="emphasis"><em>hairs</em></span>, or you could have gotten a little farther! Do
you give up now?”</p><p>“<span class="emphasis"><em>Oh.</em></span> I see!” exclaimed Laurie. “Achilles, Tortoise is
right.”</p><p>“What? Don’t change your mind <span class="emphasis"><em>now</em></span> when we are so close to
victory!” Achilles cried.</p><p>“No, I’m sure Tortoise is right,” said Laurie. “Don’t you see?
Every piece he adds is <span class="emphasis"><em>half</em></span> as long as the one before. That leaves just enough
room left over. Even if he adds an infinite number of pieces, the string will
<span class="emphasis"><em>never</em></span> reach two inches.”</p><p>“Well, hardly ever,” said Tortoise.</p><p>Achilles grimaced. “It appears you’ve proven the impossible again, Tortoise. But
just to make sure, I will check the arithmetic <span class="emphasis"><em>myself</em></span>.” He continued to
scribble in his notebook:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>+ 1/512 inch<br/>

count to infinity, it’s Achilles. Thank you for your assistance, Miss Ipsum.”</p><p>“You’re welcome, Mister Tortoise,” said Laurie. “I didn’t know
something so big could be so small.”</p><p>“That’s the Power of Two,” said Tortoise. “If you cut a number into
two halves, then cut it in two again, and so on, very soon it will be too small to see. But there
will always be something left over.”</p><p>“Mister Tortoise, do you know how long this road is? It feels like it goes on forever.
I’m trying to get to Symbol.”</p><p>“This road is quite long,” he replied. “In fact, it is
infinite.”</p><p>“Oh, no! How do I get to the end?”</p><p>“You can do it in two simple steps.”</p><p>“How?”</p><p>“How do you think? A step with your right foot, then a step with your left foot,”
said Tortoise. “Your point of view is what’s important. It’s
integral.”</p><p>Of course! If an infinite string could be less than two inches long, then an infinite road
could certainly be less than two steps, if you looked at it in the right way. Laurie closed her eyes
and took a deep breath. She tried to imagine an infinite road. That was a little too much to handle,
so instead she imagined a really, really, really, really long road. Then she imagined folding it in
half. Then she folded it in half again, and again, and again, and again . . .</p><p>When Laurie opened her eyes, Achilles and Tortoise were gone. The infinite road was a tiny,
short thing now, hardly more than a stepping stone. She stepped forward with her right foot. Then
she stepped again with her left foot. In front of her was a road sign that read . . .</p></div></body></html>

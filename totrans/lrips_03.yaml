    don’t exist, huh?”

    good bugs, though.”

    proves my point! Steganosauruses are so good at hiding that people think they’re
    imaginary.”

- en: “Who are you going to believe, me or your own eyes?” *Squawk!* Laurie felt something
    brush her shoulder. Before she knew it, a fat bird was flying away with Xor in
    its talons.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “*Hey!*” Laurie ran after the bird as it slowly flew to a nearby branch. It
    was so fat it was almost spherical, about the size and shape of a coconut. There
    were two more just like it in the tree.
  prefs: []

- en: Laurie jumped at the bird holding Xor, but it tossed the lizard to another bird,
    which caught him in its beak. She jumped at that one, but then Xor was thrown
    to another.

    and mocked her.

- en: “No!” Laurie picked up a stone and threw it at the nearest Round Robin. To her
    utter surprise, it didn’t fly away. The fat, nasty thing *caught the stone*.

- en: They played catch with the stone and Xor. Laurie threw another stone, and then
    another, but the birds caught those, too. Now the Round Robins were juggling three
    stones plus Xor. This wasn’t getting Laurie anywhere. She paused, thinking, another
    stone in her hand.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead of throwing the single stone, Laurie scooped up a large handful and
    started tossing them in nice, easy lobs, one by one. The Robins caught each stone
    and juggled it. If they hadn’t been trying to eat her friend, Laurie would have
    been impressed.

- en: Soon, the three Robins were having trouble keeping so many things in the air.
    Laurie threw the stones harder and faster, trying to knock the birds off balance.
    They sang for reinforcements.

    murderous kin. They evened out the load of stones and mocked Laurie even more
    loudly.

- en: The birds were juggling 15, 20, 25 stones now. They could catch whatever Laurie
    threw at them, and a dozen more of the creatures were waiting to join in. How
    could she get Xor away from them?

- en: It was hard to concentrate with the birds singing and Xor screaming, but Laurie
    waited again, trying to see a pattern. A Round Robin can catch anything. . . .

- en: Just as one of the birds was about to catch Xor, Laurie hit it in the beak with
    a nice big clod of dirt. A Round Robin can catch anything. But it can’t catch
    *two* things!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: She caught Xor as he fell and ran away as fast as she could. Stones and furious
    Robins flew everywhere as the flock lost its rhythm. Some tried to chase her,
    but they were too fat to keep up and too angry to rhyme.

    lizard didn’t look hurt, but he was scared out of his wits. “Birds!”

    you.”

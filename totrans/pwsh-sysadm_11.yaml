    practical—the kind of thing you can do today, right here, right now—don’t worry,
    you’re not alone! I felt the same way. But you can’t always dive in headfirst;
    sometimes it’s good to test the water before you jump in. And that’s what [Part
    I](part1.xhtml#part1) accomplished—giving an introduction for those who are new
    to PowerShell and a refresher for those who aren’t.

    what you’ve learned in [Part I](part1.xhtml#part1) and *applying* those skills
    to real-world scenarios. You’ll walk through how to use PowerShell to automate
    some common scenarios many tech professionals deal with every day. If you’re a
    seasoned tech professional, you’ve undoubtedly encountered some of these scenarios
    before: sleepily clicking your way through an Active Directory, spending way too
    much time copying and pasting between Excel sheets, freaking out as you try to
    rig up some remote-controlled software to connect a dozen machines at a time so
    you can get management that info they wanted two days ago.'

    like these. Of course, I can’t cover everything—there’s just too much boring stuff
    to automate! What follows are a few common scenarios I’ve encountered in my 20
    years in the industry. If your particular problem isn’t covered, don’t fret! By
    the end of this book, you’ll have the foundation you need to figure out how to
    automate tasks for yourself.

    million formats: SQL databases, XML files, JSON objects, CSVs, and all the rest.
    Every type of data has its own specific structure, and each structure has to be
    handled differently. In [Chapter 10](ch10.xhtml#ch10), you’ll learn how to read,
    write, and modify various forms of data.'

- en: Active Directory (AD) is a directory service. At a high level, you can think
    of a *directory service* as a hierarchical way to keep track of which IT resources
    a user can access. AD is Microsoft’s version of a directory service, and as you
    might imagine, it’s used by thousands and thousands of organizations all over
    the world, making it an area ripe for automation.

    objects from the PowerShell console. Once you get used to the AD cmdlets, we’ll
    walk through a few small projects that will help you use various AD cmdlets to
    automate some of the most mundane tasks you’re likely to see.'

    by PowerShell. Understanding how PowerShell works in cloud environments, including
    Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS), will open up shiny new frontiers
    to automate. In [Chapters 12](ch12.xhtml#ch12) and [13](ch13.xhtml#ch13), you’ll
    create virtual machines, web services, and more. You’ll even see an example of
    using PowerShell to interact with both cloud providers at once. Since PowerShell
    is indifferent to which cloud we use (it’s *cloud-agnostic*), we have the ability
    to control any cloud we want!

    before attempting the whirlwind of technical wizardry that is [Part III](part3.xhtml#part3).
    That’s what [Chapter 14](ch14.xhtml#ch14) is all about, combining all the know-how
    you’ve gathered over the course of this book and turning it into a single project.
    Here, you’ll learn how to combine disparate sources of information into a single,
    cohesive report. This will entail querying computers from AD and interrogating
    them with CIM/WMI to access useful information such as name, RAM, CPU speed, operating
    system, IP address, and more.

    tasks you can use PowerShell to automate. Having automated a couple of them yourself,
    you’ll see that there’s really no need to shell out for expensive software or
    fancy consultants to manage your environment. PowerShell can complement hundreds
    of products and services—where there’s a will (and PowerShell), there’s a way.

<p class="PartIntro">In Part III, you’ll create database objects like views, functions, procedures, triggers, and events. These objects will be stored on your MySQL server so you can call them whenever you need them.</p>
<p>In <a class="xref" href="c10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, you’ll learn how to create views that let you access the results of a query as a table-like structure.</p>
<p>In <a class="xref" href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, you’ll create your own functions and procedures to perform tasks like getting and updating the population of states.</p>
<p>In <a class="xref" href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, you’ll create your own triggers that automatically take an action you define when rows are inserted, updated, or deleted from a table.</p>
<p>In <a class="xref" href="c13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>, you’ll create your own MySQL events to manage scheduled tasks.</p>
<p>In these chapters, you’ll use the following naming conventions for different types of objects:</p>
<table id="tabular-503007p03-0001" border="1" class="TabularList">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code class="bold">beer</code></td>
<td>A table that contains data about beer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code class="bold">v_beer</code></td>
<td>A view that contains data about beer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code class="bold">f_get_ipa()</code></td>
<td>A function that gets a list of India pale ales.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code class="bold">p_get_pilsner()</code></td>
<td>A procedure that gets a list of pilsner beers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code class="bold"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="158" id="Page_158"/>tr_beer_ad</code></td>
<td>A trigger that automatically takes an action after some rows in the beer table are deleted. I use the tr_ prefix for triggers so that they won’t be confused with tables, which also start with the letter t. The suffix _ad stands for after delete. _bd stands for before delete. _bu and _au stand for before and after update, respectively. _bi and _ai stand for before and after insert, respectively. You’ll learn what those suffixes mean in Chapter 12.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code class="bold">e_load_beer</code></td>
<td>A scheduled event to load new beer data into the beer table.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In previous chapters, you’ve named tables descriptively so that other programmers can quickly understand the nature of the data that the table is storing. For database objects other than tables, you’ll continue using that approach and also prefix the name of the object with a short description of its type (as in <code>v_</code> for <em>view</em>); occasionally, you’ll add a suffix as well (as in <code>_ad</code> for <em>after delete</em>).</p>
<p>While these naming conventions aren’t law, consider using them, as they help you quickly understand a database object’s purpose.</p>

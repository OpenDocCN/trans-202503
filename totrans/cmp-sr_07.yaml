    known as a web address. But you won’t always know the address of a particular
    website. For example, you may want to find new recipes for a delectable triple
    chocolate mud cake but not know the address of a website with that recipe.

    is a very handy skill, as you’ll see! In this lesson, you’ll search for information
    on topics that interest you, such as recipes, car reviews, or puppy training advice.
    You’ll then learn how to find images on the internet, and we’ll look at a few

    nutritional information, stock prices, or anything you can think of.

    the gray bar. These are websites that have paid a substantial amount of money
    to Bing to appear first when you search for certain words. This doesn’t necessarily
    mean they’re bad sites, but they may not be as relevant as the real search results
    further down the page and may be trying to sell you something. You can recognize
    ads because they have “Ad” written next to them in small gray text.
  prefs: []

    are search terms that Bing thinks might be good alternatives to what you’ve searched

    ads shown below the list of related searches, as well as at the bottom of the

    identical information. Bing will use information such as the country you reside
    in and websites you’ve visited previously to try to decide which results suit
    you best, and it will list the results in that order. For example, if someone
    living in Australia searches for information about local veterinarians, they will
    see very different search results than someone living in Germany will.

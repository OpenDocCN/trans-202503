<p class="ChapterIntro">This book is a guide for software professionals who want to better understand concepts essential to the discipline of software security and learn how to practice the art of secure software design and implementation. Several of the topics covered here I was fortunate to have innovated myself. Others, I witnessed develop and take root. Based on my own industry experience, this book is packed with actionable ideas you can start using right away to make the software you work on more secure. </p>
<p>Two central themes run through this book: encouraging software professionals to focus on security early in the software construction process, and involving the entire team in the process of—as well as the responsibility for—security. There is certainly plenty of room for improvement in both of these areas, and this book shows how to realize these goals. </p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xxviii" id="Page_xxviii"/>I have had the unique opportunity of working on the front lines of software security over the course of my career, and now I would like to share my learnings as broadly as possible. Over 20 years ago, I was part of the team at Microsoft that first applied threat modeling at scale across a large software company. Years later, at Google, I participated in an evolution of the same fundamental practice, and experienced a whole new way of approaching the challenge. Part II of this book is informed by my having performed well over a hundred design reviews. Looking back on how far we have come provides me with a great perspective with which to explain it all anew.</p>
<p>Designing, building, and operating software systems is an inherently risky undertaking. Every choice, every step of the way, nudges the risk of introducing a security vulnerability either up or down. This book covers what I know best, learned from personal experience. I convey the security mindset from first principles and show how to bake in security throughout the development process. Along the way I provide examples of design and code, largely independent of specific technologies so as to be as broadly applicable as possible. The text is peppered with numerous stories, analogies, and examples to add spice and communicate abstract ideas as effectively as possible. </p>
<p>The security mindset comes more easily to some people than others, so I have focused on building that intuition, to help you think in new ways that will facilitate a software security perspective in your work. And I should add that in my own experience, even for those of us to whom it comes easily, there are always more insights to gain.</p>
<p>This is a concise book that covers a lot of ground, and in writing it, I have come to see its brevity as essential to what success it may achieve. Software security is a field of intimidating breadth and depth, so keeping the book shorter will, I hope, make it more broadly approachable. My aim is to get you thinking about security in new ways, and to make it easy for you to apply this new perspective in your own work.</p>
<h2 id="h1-501928f08-0001">Who Should Read This Book?</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">This book is for anyone already proficient in some facet of software design and development, including architects, UX/UI designers, program managers, software engineers, programmers, testers, and management. Tech professionals should have no trouble following the conceptual material so long as they understand the basics of how software works and how it’s constructed. Software is used so pervasively and is of such great diversity that I won’t say <em>all</em> of it needs security; however, most of it likely does, and certainly any that connects to the internet or interfaces significantly with people.</p>
<p>In writing the book, I found it useful to consider three classes of prospective readers, and would like to offer a few words here to each of these camps.</p>
<p><em>Security newbies</em>, especially those intimidated by security, are the primary audience I am writing for, because it’s important that everyone working in software understands security so they can contribute to improving it. To <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xxix" id="Page_xxix"/>make more secure software in the future we need everyone involved, and I hope this book will help those just starting to learn about security to quickly get up to speed.</p>
<p><em>Security-aware</em> readers are those with interest in but limited knowledge of security, seeking to deepen their understanding and learn more practical ways of applying these skills to their work. I wrote this book to fill in the gaps and provide plenty of ways you can immediately put what you learn here into practice.</p>
<p><em>Security experts</em> (you know who you are) round out the field. They may be familiar with much of the material, but I believe this book provides some new perspectives and still has much to offer them. Namely, the book includes discussions of important relevant topics such as secure design, security reviews, and “soft skills” that are rarely written about. </p>
<p>Part III of this book, which covers implementation vulnerabilities and mitigations, includes short excerpts of code written in either C or Python. Some examples assume familiarity with the concept of memory allocation, as well as an understanding of integer and floating-point types, including binary arithmetic. In a few places I use mathematical formulae, but nothing more than modulo and exponential arithmetic. Readers who find the code or math too technical or irrelevant should feel free to skip over these sections without fear of losing the thread of the overall narrative. References such as <code>man(1)</code> are *nix (Unix family of operating systems) commands <code>(1)</code> and functions <code>(3)</code>.</p>
<h2 id="h1-501928f08-0002">What Topics Does the Book Cover?</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The book consists of 13 chapters organized into three parts, covering concepts, design, and implementation, plus a conclusion.</p>
<h3 id="h2-501928f08-0001">Part I: Concepts</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Chapters 1 through 5 provide a conceptual basis for the rest of book. <b><span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 1">Chapter 1</span>: Foundations</b>, is an overview of information security and privacy fundamentals. <b><span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 2">Chapter 2</span>: Threats</b>, introduces threat modeling, fleshing out the core concepts of attack surfaces and trust boundaries in the context of protecting assets. The next three chapters introduce valuable tools available to readers for building secure software. <b><span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 3">Chapter 3</span>: Mitigations</b>, discusses commonly used strategies for defensively mitigating identified threats. <b><span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 4">Chapter 4</span>: Patterns</b>, presents a number of effective security design patterns and flags some anti-patterns to avoid. <b><span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 5">Chapter 5</span>: Cryptography</b>, takes a toolbox approach to explaining how to use standard cryptographic libraries to mitigate common risks, without going into the underlying math (which is rarely needed in practice).</p>
<h3 id="h2-501928f08-0002">Part II: Design</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">This part of the book represents perhaps its most unique and important contribution to prospective readers. <b><span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 6">Chapter 6</span>: Secure Design</b>, and <b><span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 7"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xxx" id="Page_xxx"/>Chapter 7</span>: Security Design Reviews</b>, offer guidance on secure software design and practical techniques for how to accomplish it, approaching the subject from the designer’s and reviewer’s perspectives, respectively. In the process, they explain why it’s important to bake security into software design from the beginning. </p>
<p>These chapters draw on the ideas introduced in the first part of the book, offering specific methodologies for how to incorporate them to build a secure design. The review methodology is directly based on my industry experience, including a step-by-step process you can adapt to how you work. Consider browsing the sample design document in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Appendix A">Appendix A</span> while reading these chapters as an example of how to put these ideas into practice.</p>
<h3 id="h2-501928f08-0003">Part III: Implementation</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Chapters 8 through 13 cover security at the implementation stage and touch on deployment, operations, and end-of-life. Once you have a secure design, this part of the book explains how to develop software without introducing additional vulnerabilities. These chapters include snippets of code, illustrating both how vulnerabilities creep into code and how to avoid them. <b><span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 8">Chapter 8</span>: Secure Programming</b>, introduces the security challenge that programmers face and what real vulnerabilities actually look like in code. <b><span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 9">Chapter 9</span>: Low-Level Coding Flaws</b>, covers the foibles of computer arithmetic and how C-style explicit management of dynamic memory allocation can undermine security. <b><span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 10">Chapter 10</span>: Untrusted Input</b>, and <b><span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 11">Chapter 11</span>: Web Security</b>, cover many of the commonplace bugs that have been well known for many years but just don’t seem to go away (such as injection, path traversal, XSS, and CSRF vulnerabilities). <b><span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 12">Chapter 12</span>: Security Testing</b>, covers the greatly underutilized practice of testing to ensure that your code is secure. <b><span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 13">Chapter 13</span>: Secure Development Best Practices</b>, rounds out the secure implementation guidance, covering some general best practices and providing cautionary warnings about common pitfalls.</p>
<p>The excerpts of code in this part of the book generally demonstrate vulnerabilities to be avoided, followed by patched versions that show how to make the code secure (labeled “vulnerable code” and “fixed code,” respectively). As such, the code herein is not intended to be copied for use in production software. Even the fixed code could have vulnerabilities in another context due to other issues, so you should not consider any code presented in this book to be guaranteed secure for any application.</p>
<h3 id="h2-501928f08-0004">Conclusion</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">The Afterword concludes the book and describes some ways that I hope it will make a positive impact. Here I summarize the key points made in the book, attempt to peer into the future, and offer speculative ideas that could help ratchet software security upward, beginning with a vision for how this book can contribute to more secure software going forward. </p>
<h3 id="h2-501928f08-0005"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xxxi" id="Page_xxxi"/>Appendices</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst"><b><span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Appendix A">Appendix A</span></b> is a sample design document that illustrates what security-aware design looks like in practice.</p>
<p><b><span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Appendix B">Appendix B</span></b> is a glossary of software security terms that appear throughout the book.</p>
<p><b><span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Appendix C">Appendix C</span></b> includes some open-ended exercises and questions that ambitious readers might enjoy researching.</p>
<p><b><span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Appendix D">Appendix D</span></b> consists of a collection of cheat sheets that summarize key concepts and processes.</p>

<h2 id="h1-501928f08-0003">Good, Safe Fun</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Before we get started, I’d like to add some important words of warning about being responsible with the security knowledge this book presents. In order to explain how to make software safe, I have had to describe how various vulnerabilities work, and how attackers potentially exploit them. Experimentation is a great way to hone skills from both the attack and defense perspectives, but it’s important to use this knowledge carefully.</p>
<p>Never play around by investigating security on production systems. When you read about cross-site scripting (XSS), for instance, you may be tempted to try browsing your favorite website with tricky URLs to see what happens. Please don’t. Even when done with the best of intentions, these explorations may look like real attacks to site administrators. It’s important to respect the possibility that others will interpret your actions as a threat—and, of course, you may be skirting the law in some countries. Use your common sense, including considering how your actions might be interpreted and the possibility of mistakes and unintended consequences, and err on the side of refraining. Instead, if you’d like to experiment with XSS, put up your own web server using fake data; you can then play around with this to your heart’s content.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while this book presents the best general advice I can offer based on many years of experience working on software security, no guidance is perfect or applicable in every conceivable context. Solutions mentioned herein are never “silver bullets”: they are suggestions, or examples of common approaches worth knowing about. Rely on your best judgment when assessing security decisions. No book can make these choices for you, but this book can help you get them right.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_114" title="114"/>The 1917 Zimmermann Telegram (<a href="#figure7-1" id="figureanchor7-1">Figure 7-1</a>), whose solving changed the course of World War I, was a secret diplomatic note sent by the German secretary of state, Arthur Zimmermann, to Mexico in January 1917. It proposed a military alliance between Germany and Mexico in the event that the United States entered the war against the Germans.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-1" id="c07-noteref-1">1</a></sup> The telegram was surreptitiously intercepted in England and forwarded to British cryptanalysts, who succeeded in breaking it. Revelation of the contents enraged Americans and helped generate support within the United States (which had thus far been neutral) for declaring war on Germany.</p>

</figure>
<p>As can be seen, the text of the Zimmermann Telegram consists of numbers, most of which have five digits. Each number stands for a word. For instance, <code>4458</code> means <code class="bold">zusammen</code> (<code class="bold">together</code>), <code>13850</code> stands for <code class="bold">finanziell</code> (<code class="bold"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_115" title="115"/>financial</code>), and <code>36477</code> represents <code class="bold">Texas</code>. To encrypt the message, the Germans used a kind of dictionary with thousands of entries for every common word of their language. Decrypted and translated, the Zimmermann Telegram reads as follows:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>On the first of February we intend to begin submarine warfare unrestricted. In spite of this, it is our intention to endeavor to keep neutral the United States of America.</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code> </code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>If this attempt is not successful, we propose an alliance on the following basis with Mexico: that we shall make war together and together make peace. We shall give general financial support, and it is understood that Mexico is to reconquer the lost territory in New Mexico, Texas, and Arizona. The details are left to you for settlement . . .</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code> </code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>You are instructed to inform the President of Mexico of the above in the greatest confidence as soon as it is certain that there will be an outbreak of war with the United States and suggest that the President of Mexico, on his own initiative, should communicate with Japan suggesting adherence at once to this plan; at the same time, offer to mediate between Germany and Japan.</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code> </code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>Please call to the attention of the President of Mexico that the employment of ruthless submarine warfare now promises to compel England to make peace in a few months.</code></p>

<p class="BodyFirst">An encryption method that replaces entire words or phrases with single numbers, letter groups, or symbols is referred to as a <em>code</em>. Codes were especially popular in the days of telegraphy, when—as will be pointed out below—many were used not only for secrecy but also for shortening messages.</p>
<p>In the case of the Zimmermann Telegram, secrecy, not condensing a message, was the main goal. The Germans introduced the system used, named Code 13040, in 1916. It was partially based on earlier codes already known to the British cryptanalysts. By analyzing dozens of telegrams in Code 13040, codebreakers in London could improve their knowledge of it, and in early 1917, when they were ordered to decipher the Zimmermann Telegram, they were well prepared. They could immediately solve parts of the message and later broke it completely.</p>
<p>Most encryption methods described in this book are not technically codes, but <em>ciphers</em>, because they work on single letters, not on words. Simple substitution ciphers such as the Caesar cipher (or ROT-13), the polyalphabetic Vigenère system, and the digraph-swapping Playfair methodology are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_116" title="116"/>all ciphers. The systems used for the Zimmermann Telegram, a dictionary code (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 14"><a href="c14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a></span>), and Navajo code talking (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 15"><a href="c15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a></span>) are all codes. To say it in a different way: a code is an encryption method that typically operates at the level of words or phrases, while a cipher generally encrypts messages at the level of individual letters.</p>
<p>We must briefly touch on some additional terminology. A <em>codegroup</em> is a number, letter group, or symbol that represents a word in a code. Any code designed for encrypting arbitrary texts needs to provide a codegroup for every single common word of a language. This could mean thousands of entries and is why writing a code usually requires creating a whole book, called a <em>codebook</em>. A code, as defined here, can therefore also be called a <em>codebook code</em>. Figures <a href="#figure7-2">7-2</a> and <a href="#figure7-3">7-3</a> show pages from codebooks printed in 1911 and 1892.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-2" id="c07-noteref-2">2</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-3" id="c07-noteref-3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>While some codes were used for all kinds of messages, others provided special-purpose vocabulary for use in telegrams. Among others, there were timber, cotton, railway, machinery, and chess codes. Some companies created codes based on their sales catalogs, with codegroups for every product. Stockbroker codes provided codegroups for words such as <code class="bold">sell</code> and <code class="bold">buy</code>, as well as company names and numbers. Codes of this kind allowed for telegraphy-based trading, the forerunner of today’s online trading.</p>
<p>A distinction needs to be made between one-part and two-part codes. In a <em>one-part code</em>, the plaintext units and the codegroups are assigned according to some order (such as the alphabetical sorting in <code class="bold">A </code>= <code>1</code>, <code class="bold">AM </code>= <code>2</code>, <code class="bold">AND </code>= <code>3</code>, <code class="bold">ARMY </code>= <code>4</code>, <code class="bold">AT </code>= <code>5</code>, <code class="bold">AUSTRIA </code>= <code>6</code> . . .). In a <em>two-part code</em>, no such sorting is possible (such as in <code class="bold">A </code>= <code>1523</code>, <code class="bold">AM </code>= <code>912</code>, <code class="bold">AND </code>= <code>2303</code>, <code class="bold">ARMY </code>= <code>809</code>, <code class="bold">AT </code>= <code>1825</code>, <code class="bold">AUSTRIA </code>= <code>145</code> . . .). Code 13040, the one used in the Zimmermann Telegram, is a two-part code.</p>
<p>A two-part code usually requires two substitution tables—one sorted by words and letters (for encryption) and another sorted by codegroups (for decryption). Decrypting a two-part code message without access to a table sorted by codegroups is laborious unless the code is very short. Likewise, Code 13040, which filled a whole book, would have been effectively unusable with a table sorted by codegroups only. Decryption would have been easy, but encryption would have been extremely time-consuming due to the difficulty of finding the words that needed to be encrypted.</p>
<p>The additional substitution table makes a two-part code more cumbersome to design than a one-part code. On the other hand, a two-part code is much more secure because a cryptanalyst can’t take advantage of the relationships between related code expressions and codegroups. For instance, if a codebreaker dealing with a one-part code knows that <code>1</code> stands for <code class="bold">A</code> and <code>3</code> stands for <code class="bold">AND</code>, they can guess that <code>2</code> represents a word located in the codebook between <code class="bold">A</code> and <code class="bold">AND</code>: for instance, <code class="bold">AM</code>. We will come back to this weakness later.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Now let’s look at a system that constitutes a sort of hybrid between two systems: the <em>nomenclator</em>. This system includes both a code, as in numbers representing different words; and a cipher, with numbers or other symbols representing letters or letter combinations. The term itself is derived from the fact that these often consisted of a collection of names. At large events, there would be a person, called a nomenclator, who would announce the names of arrivals. The word <em>nomen</em> means “name” in Latin—specifically, a person’s second name, which designated their clan.</p>
<p>No exact border can be drawn between a code and a nomenclator. Most would consider any codebook with 50,000 entries to be a code, even if it contains codegroups for the letters of the alphabet. (Most codebooks do, as it is impossible to list all words and names a potential user might want to encrypt.) Most authors use the term <em>code</em> if an encryption table contains at least a few thousand words or phrases. If it contains fewer, the table is usually referred to as a nomenclator.</p>
<p>Nomenclator encryption systems were most commonly used between the fourteenth and nineteenth centuries. For example, <a href="#figure7-4" id="figureanchor7-4">Figure 7-4</a> shows an excerpt from a letter written by a William Perwich in 1670.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-4" id="c07-noteref-4">4</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-5" id="c07-noteref-5">5</a></sup> It starts with some fifteen words in cleartext (<code class="bold">But now whilst all the world was in . . .</code>), followed by several lines of numbers beginning with 76 and interrupted by a few more plaintext words.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure7-4">Figure 7-4</a>: This letter from the seventeenth century is partially encrypted with a nomenclator.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We are dealing here with a message that is partially encrypted. An unknown person (hopefully the recipient!) wrote the plaintext equivalent above each number. The message reads as follows (bold has been removed from the parts that were originally encrypted):</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code class="bold">But now whilst all the world was</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code class="bold">in tears &amp; extraordinary affliction, you may well</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code class="bold">aske</code><code> what did Monsieur whi he</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code class="bold">imediatly</code><code> emploied himsel</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>f in sesing all Madame’s money</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_119" title="119"/><code>to a far</code><code class="bold">thing in any of</code><code> her</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>ladis hands al her Jewels</code></p>
<p>While most of the numbers (codegroups) in this message stand for letters, like in a cipher, some replace complete words, like in a code. For instance, <code>76</code> stands for <code class="bold">W</code>, <code>23</code> for <code class="bold">T</code>, and <code>47</code> for <code class="bold">H</code>. On the other hand, <code>161</code> is the equivalent of <code class="bold">Monsieur</code>, <code>164</code> of <code class="bold">Madame</code>, <code>165</code> of <code class="bold">money</code>, and <code>240</code> of <code class="bold">and</code>.</p>
<p>The following is a very simple example of a nomenclator:</p>
<ol class="none">
<li><code class="bold">A </code>= <code>1</code>, <code class="bold">B </code>= <code>2</code>,<code class="bold"> C </code>= <code>3</code>, . . . <code class="bold">Z </code>= <code>26</code></li>
<li><code class="bold">London </code>= <code>27</code>, <code class="bold">Paris </code>= <code>28</code>; <code class="bold">Rome </code>= <code>29</code>; <code class="bold">today </code>= <code>30</code>; <code class="bold">tomorrow </code>= <code>31</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Using this nomenclator, the plaintext <code class="bold">WILL TRAVEL FROM LONDON TO PARIS TOMORROW</code> encrypts to <code>23 9 12 12 / 20 18 1 21 5 12 / 6 18 15 13 / 27 / 20 15 / 28 / 31</code>.</p>
<p>Now lost, the nomenclator used for encrypting the Perwich letter probably included a few dozen words. Apart from <code class="bold">Monsieur</code>, <code class="bold">Madame</code>, <code class="bold">money</code>, and <code class="bold">and</code>, it might have contained names and places. The sender of a message could have then encrypted the most commonly used words of the English language with a single number while enciphering less common expressions letter by letter with one number each.</p>
<p><a href="#figure7-5" id="figureanchor7-5">Figure 7-5</a> shows a nomenclator used by Italian scientist and military officer Luigi Marsigli (1658–1730). He began using it in 1691, while in service to the Holy Roman emperor.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-6" id="c07-noteref-6">6</a></sup> As can be seen, this nomenclator provides three numbers to choose from (homophones) for every letter of the alphabet. In addition, there are two homophones for many common letter pairs. Finally, there is a group of 130 words, each of which has a codegroup of its own.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="" class="" height="486" src="image_fi/502727c07/f07005.png" width="646"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure7-5">Figure 7-5</a>: This nomenclator used by an Italian scientist in the late seventeenth century contains some 130 words.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_120" title="120"/>Just as there are one-part and two-part codes, there are also one-part and two-part nomenclators. In a <em>one-part nomenclator</em>, the codegroups and the letters, words, or phrases they represent are assigned according to some system; but in a <em>two-part nomenclator</em>, this is not the case. The seventeenth-century nomenclator shown above is a mixture of the two variants. While the letter codegroups are unsorted, the word codegroups are assigned in alphabetical order: <code class="bold">Ablegat</code> = <code>216</code>, <code class="bold">Adrianopol</code> = <code>217</code>, <code class="bold">Agri</code> = <code>219</code>, <code class="bold">Allianz</code> = <code>220</code>, etc.</p>
<p>One-part codes and nomenclators are more common than their two-part equivalents. This is because sorted codegroups make a code or nomenclator easier to design and more convenient to use. On the other hand, one-part schemes are less secure. As soon as a codebreaker knows, say, that <code>4523</code> stands for <code class="bold">Washington</code>, they can be sure that <code>4524</code> represents another word starting with a <code class="bold">W</code>. Similarly, once they realize that <code class="bold">A</code> = <code>44</code>, <code class="bold">B </code>= <code>45</code>, and <code class="bold">C</code> = <code>46</code>, all the other letters become easy to guess, as well.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Nomenclators and codes are an active field of inquiry. Many interesting papers have been published in recent years in the journal <em>Cryptologia</em>, in the proceedings of the HistoCrypt symposium,<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-7" id="c07-noteref-7">7</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-8" id="c07-noteref-8">8</a></sup> and in other conference proceedings.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-9" id="c07-noteref-9">9</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-10" id="c07-noteref-10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>At the HistoCrypt 2018 conference, which took place in Uppsala, Sweden, with some fifty crypto-historians, Dutch crypto history expert Karl de Leeuw initiated a workshop about codes and nomenclators.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-11" id="c07-noteref-11">11</a></sup> One of the goals of this session was to establish a consistent terminology, as different terms are sometimes used for the same thing. For example, “nulls” are also named “non-valeurs” or “blenders.” The terminology developed in this workshop has been documented online.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-12" id="c07-noteref-12">12</a></sup></p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Nomenclators emerged centuries before codes were invented. The oldest known one was used in the fourteenth century at the Vatican.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-13" id="c07-noteref-13">13</a></sup> They were probably introduced by cipher clerks, who extended simple substitution ciphers or simple homophonic ciphers by adding a number of symbols for common words to save encryption and decryption time. Later, encryption specialists created nomenclators systematically.</p>
<p>Nomenclators soon became very popular.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-14" id="c07-noteref-14">14</a></sup> If you encounter an encrypted document written before 1800, the chances are very high that it was encrypted with a nomenclator. Crypto history experts who do research in archives, such as Anne-Simone Rous, Karl de Leeuw, Beáta Megyesi, and Paolo Bonavoglia, encounter this type of encrypted message quite often. There may be tens of thousands of these documents in European archives, consisting mainly of messages sent by aristocrats, diplomats, and soldiers. Only a small fraction of these encrypted documents has ever been published for a larger audience. <a href="#figure7-6" id="figureanchor7-6">Figure 7-6</a> shows an example of a message sent by James Madison, one of the Founders and eventually president of the United States, in the eighteenth century.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-15" id="c07-noteref-15">15</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="#figure7-7" id="figureanchor7-7">Figure 7-7</a> provides another example. In 2021, while doing research on documents in the British Library, we came across this nomenclator-encrypted message from King Charles I of England in a letter he wrote on August 1, 1648, to his son.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-16" id="c07-noteref-16">16</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-17" id="c07-noteref-17">17</a></sup></p>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure7-7">Figure 7-7</a>: This 1648 letter by King Charles I used a nomenclator cipher, alternating between cleartext and ciphertext.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The first nomenclators, generated in the Middle Ages, tended to have only a few dozen codegroups that stood for words. The others stood for letters.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-18" id="c07-noteref-18">18</a></sup> Over the centuries, larger and larger nomenclator tables were constructed. Many of these included <em>homophones</em> (different codegroups standing for the same plaintext item), <em>nulls</em> (codegroups without a meaning) and <em>nullifiers</em> (codegroups making other, nearby codegroups meaningless). In addition to letters and words, letter pairs, syllables, and common phrases entered nomenclators.</p>
<p>The nomenclator table shown in <a href="#figure7-8" id="figureanchor7-8">Figure 7-8</a> is a simple one.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-19" id="c07-noteref-19">19</a></sup> As can be seen, it contains two or three homophones for every letter (for instance, <code>2</code>, <code>12</code>, and <code>22</code> for <code class="bold">E</code>). The number <code>8</code> is used as a null (seen in the last line as a “chiffre non-valeur,” or “symbol without value”). In addition, it provides some thirty-five codegroups standing for words. This nomenclator is two-part, as the codegroups are not sorted.</p>

<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_123" title="123"/>With the advent of the telegraph in the nineteenth century, the number of messages sent grew considerably, which caused an increasing demand for both encryption technology and cost-effective means of sending long messages. Thus began the era of codes, with codebooks that grew to over 50,000 entries,<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-21" id="c07-noteref-21">21</a></sup> containing codegroups that typically consisted of five- or six-digit numbers. As telegraph companies charged by the number of words transmitted, many codebooks primarily served to shorten messages. For most, making the text harder to read was not even a goal. To conserve words and therefore cost, these codes replaced not only single expressions but also common phrases with codegroups. The telegraph companies reacted to this development by charging higher fees for nonreadable (i.e., coded) messages, which caused the codebook producers to include additional and longer phrases.</p>
<p>During World War II, codes remained in use, though usually not at the highest security level. The popularity of codes and nomenclators came to an end in the middle of the twentieth century, when encryption machines (which work on letters, applying ciphers rather than codes) became widely available. Since the advent of electronics and computer technology, codes and nomenclators have served little purpose.</p>
<p>Although codes and nomenclators were the most popular kind of encryption for about 500 years, with hundreds of thousands of messages encrypted, this branch of cryptography has not received as much attention from crypto-historians as ciphers. Some renowned codebreaking books, such as those by Helen Fouché Gaines<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-22" id="c07-noteref-22">22</a></sup> and Abraham Sinkov,<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-23" id="c07-noteref-23">23</a></sup> cover the topic only very briefly or not at all. Nor have codes and nomenclators generally played a role in recreational codebreaking, because the solver would have to see the codebooks to have a chance of solving them. We are also unaware of any computer program designed primarily for analyzing and breaking codes and nomenclators. Most cryptogram books, puzzle columns, and cryptographic challenges tend to ignore codes and nomenclators entirely.</p>
<p>Recently, though, these types of systems have become an active field of historical research. Historians, who have encountered piles of encrypted documents in archives, have begun working with codebreaking experts trying to solve these. (Of course, not all archived encrypted messages are code- or nomenclator-encrypted.) A few examples are shown in the following sections. We are confident that historians will continue to publish many more cryptograms of this kind, along with efforts to solve them.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">One simple technique to make a code or nomenclator more secure is <em>superencryption</em>, or adding a second encryption step to a message that has already been encrypted with a code, nomenclator, or some other system. The second encryption step used for this purpose could be quite simple. For instance, if the codegroups consist of digits, you could add a number derived from the current date to the codegroups. On October 16, for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_124" title="124"/>example, the number 1016 might be added to every codegroup, so that <code>1234</code> becomes <code>2250</code>. While the recipient—who knows the superencryption method applied—has no trouble subtracting 1016 from every number they encounter in the ciphertext, a cryptanalyst’s work becomes much harder, as every codegroup has a different meaning on a different day of the year. Among other things, frequency analysis is almost useless if applied to messages sent on different days.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">In many cases, it is quite easy to recognize a ciphertext encrypted using a code or nomenclator rather than a cipher system. Before 1800, nomenclator messages were typically handwritten texts consisting of numbers with several digits, often interrupted by plaintext passages. The message from 1783 depicted in <a href="#figure7-10" id="figureanchor7-10">Figure 7-10</a> (a) is quite typical, and we will come back to it in the “<span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Unsolved cryptograms">Unsolved cryptograms</span>” section of this chapter. No other crypto system in frequent use at that time produced ciphertexts of this kind. The same is true of the example in <a href="#figure7-10">Figure 7-10</a> (b), from 1702.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-24" id="c07-noteref-24">24</a></sup> While systems such as a book cipher (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 14"><a href="c14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a></span>) or a digraph substitution (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 12"><a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a></span>) may produce similar-looking ciphertexts, they were uncommon at that time.</p>
<p>If we look at messages created in the nineteenth or twentieth century, things get a little more complex. Some codebooks from this era use random words from different languages as codegroups. The cryptogram from 1898 in <a href="#figure7-10">Figure 7-10</a> (c) is an example. Words such as <code>CRAQUEREZ</code> or <code>IMPAZZAVA</code> are most likely codegroups and potentially superencrypted.</p>
<p>The message in <a href="#figure7-10">Figure 7-10</a> (d) was sent by telegram in 1911.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-25" id="c07-noteref-25">25</a></sup> We can assume that it was created with a code or a nomenclator, as few other encryption methods in use in the early twentieth century produced number sequences of this kind.</p>
<p>In other cases, however, code and nomenclator messages from the last 200 years are hard to distinguish from ciphertexts created with other methods (e.g., an encryption machine such as the Enigma). This is especially the case if the codewords consist of five-letter groups; since the early twentieth century, it has been common practice to write ciphertexts of all kinds in letter groups of five. For instance, the following consular message from 1940 (provided to us by Enigma expert Frode Weierud) is a code cryptogram, though it may look similar to ciphertext produced by an encryption machine (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 15"><a href="c15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a></span>) or some other system:<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-26" id="c07-noteref-26">26</a></sup></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>BBBTT YIXBA YIVYL OXUAB ARPBO UJTNU ASZAF UKURL YORAY MAXAD EWDKY IBEKY WITOS WIYVU MAMAN REKTI ASTCA EUKIM IVYDE UCHRE CEXLO HUNAL OXUAB ARXPU WIFOH IGAEB</code></p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_125" title="125"/>A typical property of a nomenclator or code cryptogram is that parts of the message are left in cleartext. Most of the code and nomenclator messages shown in this chapter are of this kind. Of course, it is also possible to leave words in cleartext when applying a cipher, but this is less common, especially if an encryption machine was utilized.</p>

</figure>
<p>Statistical evidence can also be used to detect a code or nomenclator. For instance, repetitions among the letter or number groups of a message, such as <code>OXUAB</code> in the first and third lines of the consular message above, indicate either a relatively weak cipher (like simple substitution or a Vigenère cipher) or a code or nomenclator. This is because the ciphertext produced by a strong cipher system such as the Enigma appears visually similar to a random sequence, which makes it very unlikely that, say, a five-letter group would appear twice in a message of a few hundred characters—let alone several times.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">A code or nomenclator that is constructed and used properly is very difficult, if not impossible, to break. Nevertheless, skilled codebreakers have solved a surprising number of cryptograms of this kind. There are several reasons for this:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>It is sometimes possible to locate the table or codebook.</li>
<li>The meanings of some of the codegroups might be known to the codebreaker and can be used as cribs.</li>
<li>Many nomenclators are poorly constructed. For instance, letter/number combinations are often sorted in an easy-to-determine alphabetical or numerical order. It might also be possible to tell the difference between letter and word codegroups. For example, if two-digit numbers tended to occur one after another, they might be letter groups. If these letter groups can be broken with the usual cryptanalytic techniques, they might provide cribs to solve the other codegroups.</li>
<li>Historically, many cipher clerks didn’t use codes and nomenclators properly; for instance, they always chose the same homophone when several others were available.</li>
</ul>
<p>These weaknesses play an important role in the methods for solving nomenclators that we will introduce now.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502727c07-0001"><a class="XrefDestination" id="Findingthenomenclatortableorcodebook"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-502727c07-010"/>Finding the nomenclator table or codebook</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">One disadvantage of a code or nomenclator is that changing the key (i.e., the codebook or table used) is a costly process. Assembling a new nomenclator table is laborious, as is rewriting a whole codebook. For this reason, codes and nomenclators typically used the same table or codebook for long periods, even years, without being changed. This fact, of course, is helpful for codebreakers.</p>
<p>When trying to break a code or nomenclator message, it is therefore a good idea to search for the codebook or nomenclator table used. This approach works especially well for messages created after about 1850, when telegraphy was booming. Nomenclator tables began falling out of favor, but the number of encrypted texts and the size of the codebooks rose considerably. Hundreds of old codebooks from this time are available online today. A good starting point is to look at the websites maintained by Japanese cipher expert Satoshi Tomokiyo<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-27" id="c07-noteref-27">27</a></sup> and John McVey,<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-28" id="c07-noteref-28">28</a></sup> each of which lists hundreds of telegraphic codebooks, many of which are available for download. It is also worth remembering that many of these codebooks were not used primarily for secrecy but for shortening messages. Codebooks of this kind were sold in large quantities and not kept secret.</p>
<p>As an example, look at the nineteenth-century telegram depicted in <a href="#figure7-11" id="figureanchor7-11">Figure 7-11</a>, which was provided to us by blog reader Karsten Hansky.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-29" id="c07-noteref-29">29</a></sup> The sender of this note, a US astronomer named John Ritchie, transmitted it <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_127" title="127"/>from Boston, Massachusetts, to the Chamberlain Observatory in Denver, Colorado, on September 7, 1896. Some of the words in the telegram, such as <code class="bold">COMET</code> and <code class="bold">USUAL</code>, are obviously in cleartext. Readers knowledgeable about astronomy might recognize that <code class="bold">BROOKS</code> and <code class="bold">GIACOBINI</code> are names of comets and that <code class="bold">LICK</code> and <code class="bold">HUSSEY</code> refer to astronomical observatories in the USA. Other words, such as <code>BOUCHETROU</code>, <code>CALIMA</code>, and <code>FACILENESS</code>, don’t make sense. They could be codegroups. If so, we are dealing with a code based on made-up words.</p>
<p>Solving this short message with conventional codebreaking techniques would be extremely difficult, if not impossible. Finding the codebook is the only realistic option. Karsten tried his luck and was successful. On the Internet Archive website (<a class="LinkURL" href="https://archive.org">https://archive.org</a>), he found the matching codebook, <em>The Science Observer Code</em>, from 1885.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-30" id="c07-noteref-30">30</a></sup> Ritchie, the sender of the telegram, is one of the authors of this codebook, which made Karsten’s search a little easier!</p>

<p><a href="#figure7-12" id="figureanchor7-12">Figure 7-12</a> shows a page from this codebook—and it’s quite a special one. It was meant to transmit the plaintext numbers <code class="bold">0</code> to <code class="bold">39,999</code>. Astronomers could use these codegroups to encode positions, orbits, and other astronomical data. This code was probably not designed to keep messages secret but to avoid errors in the transmission of numbers. <code>BOUCHETROU</code>, for example, stands for <code class="bold">6835</code>. The other codegroups appearing in the telegram have the following meanings: <code>FACILENESS</code> = <code class="bold">20756</code>, <code>ARMERIEZ</code> = <code class="bold">3435</code>, <code>AFORRECHO</code> = <code class="bold">1085</code>, <code>CALIMA</code> = <code class="bold">8085</code>, <code>BOQUINEGRO</code> = <code class="bold">6691</code>, <code>HUMILIMO</code> = <code class="bold">25844</code>, <code>CHAYROOT</code> = <code class="bold">9752</code>, <code>GLADNESS</code> = <code class="bold">23266</code>, and <code>DISACCEPT</code> = <code class="bold">16388</code>.</p>

<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_129" title="129"/>Even once we know the meanings of these codegroups, the content of the telegram is difficult to understand. This is because the sender encoded dates and astronomical information in a way that made the messages shorter. The methods he used are explained in the codebook’s introduction. Applying these methods, Karsten reconstructed the following plaintext:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>Boston Mass, September 7th</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>Comet Brooks was observed by Lick (observatory) on September 6.8355 at the following</code></p>

<p>The purpose of the telegram was to inform the receiver (an astronomical observatory in Denver, Colorado) of the coordinates of the comets Brooks and Giacobini measured in Boston on September 6, 1896.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">If we can’t find the substitution table used, we’ll need to employ codebreaking methods to decipher a code or nomenclator message. As mentioned, this is an extremely difficult task if the code or nomenclator is well constructed and used properly. Computer algorithms that perform such cryptanalysis constitute an active field of research. Hill climbing (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 16"><a href="c16.xhtml">Chapter 16</a></span>), the seemingly omnipotent tool in historical codebreaking, is not very helpful here, as there are too many potential words and phrases. So far, there are no available computer programs for solving codes and nomenclators. This may change, but for the time being, solving a code or nomenclator message is mainly a matter of human intelligence, not computer intelligence.</p>
<p>Luckily for us, many codes and nomenclators are of poor quality. For instance, a one-part code or nomenclator is a lot easier to break than a two-part code or nomenclator. Even in two-part specimens, we can expect regularities in the way the codegroups are ordered, which makes breaking a message a lot easier.</p>
<p>Let’s break a nomenclator message written by a spy in Great Britain in the seventeenth century. Both the cryptogram and the solution we present are described by mathematician and crypto-historian Peter P. Fagone in <em>Cryptologia</em>.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-31" id="c07-noteref-31">31</a></sup> Here is an excerpt from the message:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>. . . 44, 38, 62, 39, I send you my 34, 74, 58, 44, 38, 62, with 116, 66, 57, give him selfe 50, 38, 30, 64, 67, 42, 50, 30, 54, 38, have, 51, 56, 64, 66, 46, 67, 26 &amp;, I, 42, 30, 68, 38, 125, the 36, 57, 68, 32, 50, 38, of it to lett him see that I deale <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_130" title="130"/>fairely what comes, 40, 62, 56, 52, 26, 116, must come, 66, 56, 27, 125, tell 103, that hee must 70, 62, 46, 66, 39, 54, 56, 38, 52, 57, 63, 38 . . .</code></p>
<p>This ciphertext consists of (mostly two-digit) numbers separated by commas. Some passages are written in cleartext. In all, the message consists of about a thousand numbers and an alphabet of ninety different numbers. Based on the criteria discussed earlier in this chapter, we can assume that this cryptogram was created with a nomenclator.</p>
<p>As a first step, we count the codegroups to perform frequency analysis. This reveals that the numbers <code>30</code> through <code>77</code> are much more frequent than the others, which raises a suspicion: those forty-eight numbers might stand for letters, while the remaining ones might encode complete words. Since the alphabet used in the seventeenth century contained twenty-four letters (<em>U</em> and <em>V</em>, as well as <em>I</em> and <em>J</em>, were not distinguished), we can appropriately hypothesize that there are two numbers (homophones) for each letter of the alphabet. We first try the following scheme:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code class="bold">A</code><code>: 30/31</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code class="bold">B</code><code>: 32/33</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code class="bold">C</code><code>: 34/35</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code class="bold">D</code><code>: 36/37</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code class="bold">E</code><code>: 38/39</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>. . .</code></p>
<p>As it turns out, we get a meaningful text. The developer of the nomenclator could not have made it easier for us!</p>
<p>Here is the excerpt shown above with the letter codegroups decrypted:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>. . . here i send you my cypher with 116, to give him selfe least g lane have lost it, 26, &amp;, i gaue 125, the double of it to lett him see that i deal fairely what comes from 26, 116, must come to 27, 125, tell 103, that he must writ c noe more . . .</code></p>
<p>Can we guess the remaining codegroups, too? They probably stand for words, phrases, or syllables. It turns out that the numbers between <code>11</code> and <code>30</code> can simply be omitted. Most or all of them are probably nulls. The numbers <code>1</code> through <code>10</code> probably stand for numbers. As the nomenclator is poorly designed, we can assume <code>1</code> = <code class="bold">1</code>, <code>2</code> = <code class="bold">2</code>, <code>3</code> = <code class="bold">3</code>, and so on. The three-digit numbers most likely represent names and places. We can’t determine their meanings without having detailed background information.</p>
<p>The content of the message does, however, confirm that a spy had indeed been at work, talking about bribery and other covert actions. Perhaps the sender of the message was a British spy in Ireland at the time of the Irish Confederate Wars (1641–1653). Their identity will probably remain a mystery forever.</p>
<p>Next, let’s look at a papal cipher from the sixteenth century. <a href="#figure7-13" id="figureanchor7-13">Figure 7-13</a> shows a nomenclator message sent by the Vatican to a papal diplomat in Poland in 1573. This message was originally broken by crypto-historian Albert Leighton in 1969.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-32" id="c07-noteref-32">32</a></sup></p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_131" title="131"/><figure>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure7-13">Figure 7-13</a>: This sixteenth-century nomenclator message was broken because the nomenclator used was a very simple one.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The ciphertext consists of an unbroken series of numbers. Closer inspection reveals a tendency for the numbers to be linked in pairs. There are exceptions, such as a few three-figure groups and dots over the first digits of certain pairs. Here’s a transcript of the first two lines. The dotted digits are transcribed as underlined digits:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>608 53 17 11 75 17 55 25 77 75 29 97 41 77 13 79 11 77 15 59 19 79 15 79 17 39 19 79 15 59 13 79 99 58 99 11</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>17 59 13</code> <code class="bold">6</code><code>7 79 15 77 17 99 15 15 83 </code><code class="bold">5</code><code>4 97 41 57 15 77 75 15 59 26 99 15 37 </code><code class="bold">1</code><code>5 38 34 17 37 57 19 79</code></p>
<p>Considering the era when this was written, and knowing that the Vatican used an abundance of nomenclators during the Renaissance, we can assume that the text is nomenclator-encrypted. If we are dealing with a poorly constructed nomenclator, it seems possible that the three-digit numbers and the dotted numbers stand for words, while all other digit pairs represent letters. Here is a frequency analysis of the supposed letters:</p>

<p>As can be seen, thirty two-digit numbers are used. If they really stand for the letters of the alphabet, there are enough numbers to encode the letters <code class="bold">A</code> through <code class="bold">Z</code>, as well as a few nulls. Four of the five most frequent <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_132" title="132"/>numbers start with <code>1</code> or <code>2</code> (<code>25</code>, <code>29</code>, <code>17</code>, and <code>13</code>) and these do not form longer sequences in the ciphertext. They might stand for vowels. In the Italian language, the vowels <em>E</em>, <em>A</em>, <em>I</em>, and <em>O</em> all have nearly the same frequency (between 10% and 12%), while <em>U</em> (usually identical to the <em>V</em> in old texts) makes up only about 3% of text (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Appendix B">Appendix B</span>). It is therefore likely that there is only one codegroup representing <code class="bold">U</code> and that this is the rarest vowel codegroup, namely <code>11</code>.</p>
<p>The most common non-vowel is <code>77</code>. This number must stand for <code class="bold">N</code>, the most common consonant in Italian. The next three consonants are <code>59</code>, <code>79</code>, and <code>99</code>. They might stand for the letters <code class="bold">R</code>, <code class="bold">S</code>, and <code class="bold">T</code>. Trial and error confirms that <code>59 </code>= <code class="bold">R</code>, <code>79</code> = <code class="bold">S</code>, and <code>99</code> = <code class="bold">T</code> are valid. Knowing these consonants and the most frequent Italian digraphs (also described in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Appendix B">Appendix B</span>), it is possible to derive the meaning of vowels <code>25</code>, <code>29</code>, <code>17</code>, and <code>13</code>: <code class="bold">A</code><code> </code>= <code>25</code>, <code class="bold">E </code>= <code>13</code>, <code class="bold">I </code>= <code>17</code>, and <code class="bold">O </code>= <code>29</code>. What we have found out so far is sufficient to decipher most of the message:</p>

<h4 id="h3-502727c07-0001">Sixteenth-century solution</h4>
<p class="BodyFirst">In 1569, Queen Elizabeth I of England had her cousin Mary, Queen of Scots, imprisoned. Mary was known to communicate frequently in cipher with her supporters. </p>
<p>Among her allies was a group of English Catholics who attempted to murder Elizabeth I in order to put Mary on the English throne. Mary and the conspirators communicated via encrypted letters hidden in a beer barrel cork. Unfortunately for her, the servant who transported the messages was an agent who worked for the English spymaster Francis Walsingham, who in turn provided copies of the encrypted letters to his codebreaker, Thomas Phelippes.</p>
<p>Phelippes noticed that Mary and the conspirators wrote their encrypted letters in an alphabet consisting of about forty symbols. His guess was that he was dealing with a nomenclator comprising about twenty-five letter symbols, with around fifteen standing for words or nulls. Nomenclators consisting of only forty codegroups were quite common in the sixteenth century. Later, they grew much larger.</p>
<p>A forty-codegroup nomenclator can be solved with frequency analysis. We don’t know exactly how Phelippes worked, but he probably assumed that the most frequent symbols stood for the most frequent letters of the English language, though he may have been confused by a few nulls. After some <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_135" title="135"/>analysis, Phelippes was able to reconstruct the whole nomenclator, as shown in <a href="#figure7-15" id="figureanchor7-15">Figure 7-15</a>.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-38" id="c07-noteref-38">38</a></sup></p>

</figure>
<p>With the encryption system broken, Walsingham could easily monitor the messages exchanged between Mary and the conspirators, which became more and more intense. Finally, Walsingham and Phelippes faked a message to Mary, asking her to provide a list of the conspirators—a plan that succeeded. Based on this evidence, Mary’s conspirators were arrested, condemned to death, and executed in 1586. After a separate trial, Mary, Queen of Scots, was herself beheaded on February 8, 1587.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Another remarkable success story has to do with three people who are mentioned several times in our book: George Lasry, Norbert Biermann, and Satoshi Tomokiyo (see <a href="#figure7-16" id="figureanchor7-16">Figure 7-16</a>). One of their hobbies for more than a decade has been checking archives around the world for any unknown encrypted messages so that they can document and crack them. Many large archives and private collections still have encrypted papers that can’t be read and sometimes cannot even be attributed. Most of these papers are centuries old. The intrepid trio (and other colleagues of ours) have found that many encrypted documents like these can be found by searching the online catalogs for digitized documents that might be tagged with words <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_136" title="136"/>such as <em>cipher</em>. Tomokiyo goes a step further, sometimes searching through documents one by one, to see if any parts of them are encrypted!</p>
<figure>
<img alt="" class="" height="248" src="image_fi/502727c07/f07016.png" width="666"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure7-16">Figure 7-16</a>: From left: George Lasry (Israel), Norbert Biermann (Germany), and Satoshi Tomokiyo (Japan) made a remarkable discovery while searching through the archives of the National Library of France.  </p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In 2021, while combing the online collections of the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF) for enciphered documents, the team stumbled upon a large set of unlabeled papers, all in cipher, and all of which used the same set of graphical symbols (see <a href="#figure7-17" id="figureanchor7-17">Figure 7-17</a>). According to the BnF catalog, the documents were supposed to be from the first half of the sixteenth century and related to Italian matters. In April 2021, the team first tried to crack this cipher with the assumption that the language was Italian, but they had no luck. In February 2022 they tried again, this time assuming the language might be French, and employing a hill-climbing program with a simulated annealing algorithm (see Chapter 16). This time they could obtain fragments of plausible text, such as “catholi” and “persecu.”<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-39" id="c07-noteref-39">39</a></sup></p>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure7-17">Figure 7-17</a>: An encrypted letter from the sixteenth century, lost in the archives until it was discovered in 2021  </p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_137" title="137"/>They then followed up with manual codebreaking skills such as word guessing (see Chapter 4) to recover, bit by bit, the cipher key—in this case a nomenclator table combined with a homophonic cipher. This system was much more complex than the earlier one, as shown in <a href="#figure7-15">Figure 7-15</a>. In all, the team was able to identify 219 distinct symbols (see <a href="#figure7-18" id="figureanchor7-18">Figure 7-18</a>), some of which stood for syllables or words. As they became able to read the documents, the team realized that the texts had been written by a prisoner, with mentions of captivity, phrases such as “my son,” and the name Walsingham. That name was key, since in this time period, Sir Francis Walsingham was spymaster for Queen Elizabeth I, which aroused the suspicion that the letters might be from Mary, Queen of Scots, the imprisoned cousin of Queen Elizabeth. This hypothesis was confirmed after the team found copies of some corresponding plaintexts in British archives. The team then set out to transcribe and decipher an astonishing total of 57 encrypted letters by Mary. </p>

</figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_138" title="138"/>The newly deciphered letters turned out to be part of a secret correspondence long considered by historians to have been lost. Most were written between 1578 and 1584 from Mary to Michel de Castelnau, the French ambassador in England. The letters constitute a voluminous body of new primary material on Mary Stuart—about 50,000 words in total. They highlight Anglo-French and Scottish politics, Mary’s efforts to get herself released and reinstated as queen of Scotland, and a multitude of other topics. The find has opened a treasure trove for modern-day historians.</p>
<p>This sensational discovery, considered by expert historian John Guy from Cambridge to be “the most important new find on Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, for 100 years,”<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-40" id="c07-noteref-40">40</a></sup> was announced on February 8, 2023 (coincidentally, the anniversary of Mary’s beheading in 1587). It made international headlines and caused us, at the last minute, to add this new section to our book!<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-41" id="c07-noteref-41">41</a></sup></p>
<p>A good takeaway from this is that the work of crypto historians is not yet done. There are many such documents waiting to be found. At a HistoCrypt conference, it was estimated that there are hundreds, perhaps thousands of such nomenclator messages still to be located and deciphered, which can give us yet another window into the past.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502727c07-0006"><a class="XrefDestination" id="Collinson’ssearchexpedition"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-502727c07-017"/>Collinson’s search expedition</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Between 1850 and 1855, almost fifty encrypted advertisements were published at regular intervals in the London-based newspaper <em>The Times</em>, apparently in the same code. Here is an example, from October 1, 1851:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>No. 16th.-S.lkqo. C. hgo &amp; Tatty. F. kmn at npk1 F. qgli lngk S mhn F. olhi E qkpn. S. niql S mnhq, F. qgli.

S. ompi C. mkop F. oiph to Mr. C. nhmg &amp; F. mpkh. nmkq E. lhpq. J. de W.</code></p>
<p>A century later, in 1980, <em>The Times</em> published a competition to see whether anyone could solve a similar message from April 2, 1852. No one could, though it was pointed out that one message seemed to have something that looked like a latitude and longitude.</p>
<p>Several years passed before two experienced codebreakers independently succeeded in solving these messages. One of them, John Rabson, reported on his approach in 1992 in the scientific journal <em>Cryptologia</em>.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-42" id="c07-noteref-42">42</a></sup> Rabson suspected the use of a code with additional letter-based encryption (superencryption). After some searching, he found that the <em>Universal Code of Signals</em> was a good candidate. Encryption had been used to convert the numbers in this code into sequences of letters. He decoded the message as follows:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>No. 16th. your wife and family were all well when I left Bernard &amp; Tatty both at home Captain Penny arrived at from Baffin's Bay early in September without success Captain Austin hourly expected <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_139" title="139"/>Margarets 6th son born 13th September a box went to Sandwich Isles by Antelope early in January Emily Sophia Thomason go to Wales early in October James goes to Mr. Hawk &amp; lives in Gateshead. J. de W.</code></p>
<p>Now the context of the advertisement series was clear. The encrypted messages were likely published by a family member of British navigator Richard Collinson (1811–1883), who led an expedition to the North American Arctic from 1850 to 1855 to attempt a rescue of the lost polar explorer Lord John Franklin and his crew, who had not returned from their attempt to discover the Northwest Passage.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that these encrypted ads were meant for military or commercial secrets. More likely, they were simply encrypted for the matter of privacy. The ads were meant to tell Collinson about his family and friends during his five-year expedition. It seems that the creator of the messages hoped that <em>The Times</em>, which was the most important newspaper in the world at that time, could be obtained even in very remote places.</p>
<p>Even with a codebook, coming up with an exact translation can be tricky. For instance, here is another of the messages, from January 1, 1853:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>S lmpi F. npi npil pil pink. C. klmh F. oimg ogq, khq lqkh ikpg ogql, lqoi qoin oing lqkh. hmig C, omgk F, npi npil qmk. C hgo, F, ploi omnl. qoip, C qkin.

<p>The numbers of the key have been turned into letters:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code class="bold">0987654321</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>ghiklmnopq</code></p>
<p>As Elonka worked on this message, it became clear that decrypting it would require a great deal of guesswork, as well as an allowance for human error. For example, <code>npil</code>, translated directly with the cipher key, comes out to <code>4286</code>, which in the codebook means <code class="bold">hook</code>. This didn’t make sense in context, producing sentences like <code class="bold">At hook and elsewhere</code> and <code class="bold">All is well at hook</code>. The <code>4286</code> number appeared frequently, but then, sometimes in the same context, she would instead find <code>npkl</code>, or <code>4276</code>, which means <code class="bold">home</code>. When she swapped out <code class="bold">hook</code> for <code class="bold">home</code> to get phrases like <code class="bold">All is well at home</code>, the message started to make a lot more sense!</p>
<p>Other places in the message were similarly vague, making it difficult to tell whether the decryption was wrong or if there was a typo. That turned things into a real puzzle. Another difficulty was that the publisher of the <em>Universal Code of Signals</em> reprinted it from time to time, and it was unclear exactly which version the author had used for these messages. Of course, it couldn’t have been later than 1855. But Elonka was only able to find the 1864 version or later ones, which couldn’t have been used for a message sent in 1853.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_140" title="140"/>Her best guess for plaintext is this:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>All are well at home and elsewhere. Margaret had another boy on the evening of Christmas Day, going on well. Emily is home again. Bernard is down for Christmas. Charlotte going too adding to popularity. Harriet is staying with Fanny. Letters arrived from Benjamin on the Royalist, all are well, liking Frederickshaven. Stokesley at home again, home is full. P and M never better, 12 grandchildren in the home. Sarah &amp; Jane, all are well. Laurence Delaney is going to marry Miss Colridge. No news from Resolute.</code></p>
<p>In any case, after Collinson’s expedition, his brother compiled his logs into a book called the <em>Journal of HMS Enterprise</em> (1889), after the name of the ship. According to this book, Collinson did receive at least four of the messages, when he reached “Bangu Wangie” (probably the town of Banyuwangi), in Indonesia (see <a href="#figure7-19" id="figureanchor7-19">Figure 7-19</a>).<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-43" id="c07-noteref-43">43</a></sup></p>

<p class="BodyFirst">In the World War II Pacific theater, the United States’ armed forces encountered numerous Japanese encryption systems. US and British codebreakers were quite successful in deciphering these. Their two most famous <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_141" title="141"/>accomplishments were breaking JN-25, the primary Japanese naval code, and PURPLE, a machine-based encryption system used for Japanese diplomatic messages.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-44" id="c07-noteref-44">44</a></sup> The US Army SIS (Signals Intelligence Service), led by the legendary William Friedman, and his team, led by Frank Rowlett, even broke PURPLE without ever having seen a copy of the machine (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 15"><a href="c15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a></span>).</p>
<p>The other history-changing success was the breaking of JN-25. Besides encryption machines (such as PURPLE), the Japanese had been using a number of manual codes for encrypting their communications. The most important of these was JN-25, so named by American cryptologists because it was the twenty-fifth Japanese Navy encryption system they had identified.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-45" id="c07-noteref-45">45</a></sup> JN-25 had been introduced in early 1939, just a few months before the German invasion of Poland and the beginning of the war. The encryption system was immediately brought under cryptanalytic scrutiny by groups in Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Bletchley Park’s John Tiltman made the first break into JN-25 by September 1939. Independently, in the United States, the comparable group in the US Navy’s OP-20-G, led by “First Lady of Naval Cryptology” Agnes Meyer Driscoll, made a similar discovery in 1940.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-46" id="c07-noteref-46">46</a></sup> Both had discovered that JN-25 was a superencrypted code that produced five-digit groups. The massively complicated system comprised up to 30,000 codegroups that were listed in a codebook and had hundreds of pages of other numbers, or additives, used for superencryption.</p>
<p>The codebreakers had learned that JN-25 contained an error-detection scheme they could exploit: all codegroups were numbers divisible by three.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-47" id="c07-noteref-47">47</a></sup> But, even knowing this, they could decipher only about 10% to 20% of the Japanese messages. Progress was hampered somewhat simply because there was not much traffic for the Allied cryptanalysts to intercept and analyze.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-48" id="c07-noteref-48">48</a></sup></p>
<p>After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the United States entered the war and resources devoted to cryptology increased dramatically. The Americans first used punch card tabulating machines manufactured by IBM, then designed completely new codebreaking machines to assist with further cryptanalytic attacks. The Japanese changed codebooks and additives from time to time, so analysts had to break several systems in parallel, but within a few months after Pearl Harbor, they could read approximately 90% of JN-25 messages.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-49" id="c07-noteref-49">49</a></sup></p>
<p>This proved especially important in mid-1942, when the encrypted Japanese radio messages mentioned plans to attack a target codenamed <code>AF</code>. US Naval intelligence specialists knew that codenames starting with the letter <code>A</code> were generally used for islands near Hawaii (for example, <code class="bold">Oahu</code> was <code>AH</code>), but they were not sure of the location of <code>AF</code>. They guessed that it represented the tiny island of Midway.</p>
<p>To confirm this suspicion, cryptanalysts Jasper Holmes and Joseph Rochefort suggested that the US military base on Midway broadcast a “plain language” radio message stating that Midway’s water purification system had broken down and that fresh water was urgently needed. The plan was <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_142" title="142"/>approved by Commander Edwin T. Layton and Admiral Chester W. Nimitz and put into effect. The Japanese took the bait, and within twenty-four hours, the American codebreakers picked up a Japanese intelligence report encrypted with JN-25 saying, “AF is short on water.” The suspicion that AF stood for Midway was confirmed.</p>
<p>This information allowed the Americans to correctly position their fleets to engage the Japanese Navy near Midway,<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-50" id="c07-noteref-50">50</a></sup> a battle that became a major turning point in the war. Crypto-historians often cite this as one of the cases where the deciphering of a single message could change an entire war.</p>

<p>In 2013, antique-costume collector Sara Rivers-Cofield acquired what she described in her blog as a “mid-1880s two-piece bustle dress of bronze silk with striped rust velvet accents and lace cuffs.”<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-52" id="c07-noteref-52">52</a></sup> When she turned the skirt inside out, she discovered a hidden pocket that contained two pieces of paper, both of which contained encrypted writing (<a href="#figure7-21" id="figureanchor7-21">Figure 7-21</a>). Here’s a transcript of sheet 1:</p>

<p>It is not difficult to see that this message was created with a code. Rather than seemingly random text or numbers, the codegroups are meaningful words, like <code>Cairo</code>, <code>Greenbay</code>, <code>Calgary</code>, <code>duck</code>, and <code>loamy</code>. Such codes were not uncommon in the second half of the nineteenth century. The text was probably meant to be sent as a telegram, as below each line, the number of words contained in that line is noted. (These numbers are omitted in the transcript.) Note that just as our book was going to press, we heard that this might have been solved!

<p class="BodyFirst">On June 27, 1916, a man robbed the ticket counter at the Western Ohio Railway in Lima, Ohio. The robber held up a ticket agent at gunpoint and forced him to hand over the contents of a safe. He escaped with $265 (equivalent to about $6,000 today). A few weeks later, the magazine <em>Enigma</em>, published by the National Puzzlers’ League, wrote this:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom">The police department of Lima, O., is greatly puzzled over a cryptic message received in connection with the robbery of a Western Ohio ticket agent. Here it is: <code>WAS NVKVAFT BY AAKAT TXPXSCK UPBK TXPHN OHAY YBTX CPT MXHG WAE SXFP ZAVFZ ACK THERE FIRST TXLK WEEK WAYX ZA WITH THX.</code></p>
<p>This interesting story was discovered in 2013 by Zodiac Killer expert Dave Oranchak and popularized by British cipher mysteries blogger Nick Pelling.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-53" id="c07-noteref-53">53</a></sup> Nick found two articles about this cryptogram in old issues of the <em>Lima Times-Democrat</em>. The version of the ciphertext printed there is slightly different from the one published by the National Puzzlers’ League. As the <em>Enigma</em> author probably copied it from the newspaper, we should work with the <em>Lima Times-Democrat</em> version. Here it is:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>Was nvlvaft by aakat txpxsck upbk txphn ohay ybtx cpt mxhg wae sxfp zavfz ack there first txlk week wayx za with thx</code></p>
<p>To our regret, we don’t know the full relationship of the cryptogram to the robbery. The most likely explanation is that this message is a codebook-encrypted telegram. The sender seems to have left a few of the less-important words (<code class="bold">WAS</code>, <code class="bold">BY</code>, <code class="bold">FIRST</code>, <code class="bold">THX</code> . . .) in cleartext and looked up the others in a (not-yet-discovered) codebook.</p>
<p>If the train station robbery cryptogram really is a telegram, it seems possible that the robber sent it immediately before or after the act. Perhaps the telegraph clerk became suspicious after the telegram was sent and informed the police that he might have dealt with a criminal.</p>
<p>The train station robbery cryptogram has never been deciphered.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Ignatius Pollaky (1828–1918), a successful private detective in Victorian England, was one of the individuals who inspired Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-54" id="c07-noteref-54">54</a></sup> Pollaky frequently used newspaper advertisements to search for witnesses or communicate encrypted messages. He published the ad in <a href="#figure7-22" id="figureanchor7-22">Figure 7-22</a> in <em>The Times</em> (London) on February 20, 1871.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-55" id="c07-noteref-55">55</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c07-endnote-56" id="c07-noteref-56">56</a></sup> This ciphertext looks very much like a message encrypted in a code. Perhaps some superencryption was used. There were many codebooks in use during the Victorian era, so Pollaky had many options to choose from.</p>
<p>So far, nobody has been able to decipher this message.</p>

<p>High-resolution scans of this letter, as well as a transcript, are available online at <a class="LinkURL" href="https://codebreaking-guide.com">https://codebreaking-guide.com</a>. The letter appears to have been encrypted with a code. Considering that this code probably contained several thousand codegroups and that there are only two pages of encrypted text for analysis, breaking this message with conventional codebreaking tools likely won’t work. The only realistic chance of deciphering it is to find the codebook.</p>

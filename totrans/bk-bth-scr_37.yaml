- en: I hope that you’ve enjoyed reading this book half as much as I’ve enjoyed writing
    it. For me, this project was a new, exciting, and illuminating endeavor. It’s
    my first, and quite possibly only, book. If you had told me upon high school graduation
    that I’d someday be an author, I never would’ve believed you.

- en: I was a math kid, and I also excelled at a BASIC coding course that was offered
    my senior year. I did well enough in English, but I then considered writing to
    be a chore. In college, I enjoyed two technical writing courses as part of my
    major, but the idea of a book still would’ve seemed absurd. After many years of
    reading different types of books and articles, I slowly began to appreciate the
    creative outlet that is writing. I dabbled here and there but never published
    anything, not even a blog. Sometime around my 50th birthday and after years of
    coding bat files, the hint of an inkling of an idea for writing this book took
    shallow root, but I wasn’t yet ready to act upon this most bizarre midlife crisis,
    if that’s what it was.

- en: More than two years later, in May 2020, two events collided that left me with
    some spare time allowing me to put fingertips to keyboard. (By this point in the
    computer age, we should have a better digital euphemism for “put pen to paper.”)
    First, the realization that the coronavirus pandemic would last more than a couple
    of months became glaringly obvious. I had plenty of vacation time and no travel
    plans. Second, after a decade and a half of intense parenting, including the coaching
    of several youth sports teams, my son reached an age where instead of demanding
    my time, he demanded the exact opposite (like most teenagers).

    hiking that summer. I also did a lot of running, but I returned to the idea of
    this book, especially with the knowledge that normality wouldn’t be returning
    before temperatures dropped in the Northeast. Sporadically and in no particular
    order, I wrote a chapter here and there, not knowing if I’d post them on a blog
    or find some other medium, but before long I knew that I wanted to write a book,
    an actual physical book. As the mercury dropped, I wrote every weekend, and this
    continued through to the spring and summer ... and the next fall, and beyond.
    (I code fast but write slow.) My wife to me in early June 2021: “So what do you
    want for Father’s Day, other than to be left alone so that you can write?”'

- en: After a couple of years, I presented what I thought was a finished product to
    No Starch Press. To my amazement, my publisher of first choice signed me up. Being
    a novice, my manuscript was raw, and they had some great ideas about how I could
    organize and improve what I had without losing my voice. (As for my voice, I write
    first for myself and then consider possible critiques. Who would write “the hint
    of an inkling of an idea?” Is it pretentious or just inane? I don’t know, but
    I like it and can only hope you do too.)

- en: More than 90 percent of what’s in this book represents the type of coding and
    techniques that I’ve used often personally and professionally. As for the small
    amount of material that I had to research, I hope that I’ve blended it seamlessly
    (and indistinguishably) with what’s in my wheelhouse.

- en: For most coding languages, the idea of a single book covering the majority of
    the language’s functionality would be ludicrous. For instance, there are introductory
    Python books, others for Python and web development, and yet others for Python
    and databases, just to name a few. But Batch scripting is a more manageable subject.
    I hope that I’ve included most of the important features about the language for
    beginners and experts alike, but no book can be truly comprehensive.

    transfers data from and to a server, cipher encrypts and decrypts files, and runas
    runs a bat file under a different user profile. There are other commands specific
    to system administration that I haven’t covered, and I’ve left others out because
    I simply don’t find them useful. I haven’t mentioned the replace command (until
    now) because Batch has much better tools available for replacing one file with
    another.

- en: For those remaining pieces of Batch that I haven’t covered, I hope you now have
    the tools to perform your own research. More than once, I’ve mentioned that you
    can find a full list of commands including a description, syntax, options, and
    examples at *[https://<wbr>ss64<wbr>.com<wbr>/nt<wbr>/](https://ss64.com/nt/)*.
    You can scroll through the list of commands looking for something that might be
    useful for a particular problem or if you’ve heard of a certain command for configuring
    internet protocols and want to learn more, just click on **ipconfig** and explore.
    No book is going to have everything, but I hope that you’ve found this one to
    contain the essentials, and much more.

    bat file that needs something a little out of the ordinary—arrays, booleans, floating-point
    arithmetic, stacks, maybe even an object—I hope that you don’t immediately fall
    back on writing some compiled code. Depending on the situation, a few lines of
    Batch might be the most efficient solution.

    consider yourself an honorary coder. But more to the point, the next time you
    have a redundant task that must be done at certain intervals, perhaps daily, consider
    Batch. Run a simple bat file at the end of the day to copy your day’s work to
    a backup server or a shared directory. If a few reports need to be merged into
    a single file, don’t cut and paste. Impress your boss and co-workers, and maybe
    even yourself.

    book, I obviously backed up to the cloud, but I also wanted a date-stamped folder
    of the current state of all Word documents, bat files, and anything else associated
    with this book, and I wanted to make this backup at the end of each day of writing.
    Just before logging off, I would plug a thumb drive into my laptop and run a bat
    file containing just this code from my desktop:'

- en: This quick and dirty bat file builds a datestamp for the target folder name
    under *D:\Batch\*. The xcopy command creates my backup from *C:\Batch\*, and the
    pause command holds the window open so that I’ll know if I’ve run out of disk
    space. This was an incredibly simple solution that fit my needs, but you can expand
    on this to build a more robust bat file.

- en: I consider myself a scripting evangelist, in general, and a Batch evangelist,
    in particular. Coders too often fall back on compiled code for tasks more easily
    and efficiently performed with a script. In [Chapter 1](chapter1.xhtml), I defined
    the word *batphile* as a “lover of nocturnal flying mammals.” I’d now like to
    assign to it a secondary definition, “lover of bat files.” (Batfilephile is painfully
    clunky.) I hope that if you weren’t already, you’re now a proud batphile—in at
    least one sense of the word. Some fear the flying mammals, but they’re fascinating
    animals and rather adorable.

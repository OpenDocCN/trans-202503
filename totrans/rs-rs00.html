<p class="ChapterIntro">In any language, the gap between what the introductory material teaches you and what you know after years of hands-on experience is always wide. Over time, you build familiarity with idioms, develop better mental models for core concepts, learn which designs and patterns work and which do not, and discover useful libraries and tools in the surrounding ecosystem. Taken together, this experience enables you to write better code in less time.</p>
<p>With this book, I’m hoping to distill years of my own experience writing Rust code into a single, easy-to-digest resource. <em>Rust for Rustaceans</em> picks up where <em>The Rust Programming Language</em> (“the Rust book”) leaves off, though it’s well suited to any Rust programmer that wants to go beyond the basics, wherever you learned the trade. This book delves deeper into concepts such as unsafe code, the trait system, <code>no_std</code> code, and macros. It also covers new areas like asynchronous I/O, testing, embedded development, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xxii" id="Page_xxii"/>ergonomic API design. I aim to explain and demystify these more advanced and powerful features of Rust and to enable you to build faster, more ergonomic, and more robust applications going forward.</p>
<h2 id="h1-501850f07-0001">What’s in the Book</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">This book is written both as a guide and as a reference. The chapters are more or less independent, so you can skip directly to topics that particularly interest you (or are currently causing you headaches), or you can read the book start to finish for a more holistic experience. That said, I do recommend that you start by reading Chapters 1 and 2, as they lay the foundation for the later chapters and for many topics that will come up in your day-to-day Rust development. Here’s a quick breakdown of what you’ll find in each chapter:</p>
<ol class="none">
<li>Chapter 1, <em>Foundations</em>, gives deeper, more thorough descriptions of fundamental Rust concepts like variables, memory, ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes that you’ll need to be familiar with to follow the remainder of the book.</li>
<li>Chapter 2, <em>Types</em>, similarly provides a more exhaustive explanation of types and traits in Rust, including how the compiler reasons about them, their features and restrictions, and a number of advanced applications.</li>
<li>Chapter 3, <em>Designing Interfaces</em>, covers how to design APIs that are intuitive, flexible, and misuse-resistant, including advice on how to name things, how to use the type system to enforce API contracts, and when to use generics versus trait objects.</li>
<li>Chapter 4, <em>Error Handling</em>, explores the two primary kinds of errors (enumerated and opaque), when the use of each is appropriate, and how each of these are defined, constructed, propagated, and handled.</li>
<li>Chapter 5, <em>Project Structure</em>, focuses on the non-code parts of a Rust project, such as Cargo metadata and configuration, crate features, and versioning.</li>
<li>Chapter 6, <em>Testing</em>, details how the standard Rust testing harness works and presents some testing tools and techniques that go beyond standard unit and integration tests, such as fuzzing and performance testing.</li>
<li>Chapter 7, <em>Macros</em>, covers both declarative and procedural macros, including how they’re written, what they’re useful for, and some of their pitfalls.</li>
<li>Chapter 8, <em>Asynchronous Programming</em>, gives an introduction to the difference between synchronous and asynchronous interfaces and then delves into how asynchrony is represented in Rust both at the low level of <code>Future</code> and <code>Pin</code> and at the high level of <code>async</code> and <code>await</code>. The chapter also explains the role of an asynchronous executor and how it makes the whole async machinery come together.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xxiii" id="Page_xxiii"/>Chapter 9, <em>Unsafe Code</em>, explains the great powers that the <code>unsafe</code> keyword unlocks and the great responsibilities that come with those powers. You’ll learn about common gotchas in unsafe code as well as tools and techniques you can use to reduce the risk of incorrect unsafe code.</li>
<li>Chapter 10, <em>Concurrency (and Parallelism)</em>, looks at how concurrency is represented in Rust and why it can be so difficult to get right in terms of both correctness and performance. It covers how concurrency and asynchrony are related (but not the same), how concurrency works when you get closer to the hardware, and how to stay sane while trying to write correct concurrent programs.</li>
<li>Chapter 11, <em>Foreign Function Interfaces</em>, teaches you how to make Rust cooperate nicely with other languages and what FFI primitives like the <code>extern</code> keyword actually do.</li>
<li>Chapter 12, <em>Rust Without the Standard Library</em>, is all about using Rust in situations where the full standard library isn’t available, such as on embedded devices or other constrained platforms, where you’re restricted to what the <code>core</code> and <code>alloc</code> modules provide.</li>
<li>Chapter 13, <em>The Rust Ecosystem</em>, doesn’t cover a particular Rust subject but instead aims to give broader guidance about working in the Rust ecosystem. It contains descriptions of common design patterns, advice on staying up to date on additions to the language and best practices, tips on useful tools and other useful trivia I’ve accumulated over the years that isn’t otherwise described in any single place.</li>

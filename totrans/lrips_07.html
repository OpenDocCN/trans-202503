leather jacket pulled up on a red motorcycle. On the back of the bike was a huge bag full of
packages and envelopes.</p><p>“Hello, who are you?” Laurie asked.</p><p>“I’m a daemon. Who else would I be? Hold on, there’s a message for you in
here somewhere.” He rummaged around in his bag and handed Laurie a plain envelope. When she
opened it, all she found inside was the strangest nonsense:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>L<span class="smaller">OREM</span> I<span class="smaller">PSUM</span>,

U<span class="smaller">T ENIM AD MINIM VENIAM, QUIS NOSTRUD EXERCITATION . . .</span></p></blockquote></div><p>“Are you sure this is for me?”</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00021a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00021"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="figs/web/056fig01.png.jpg"/></div></div><p>“Are you sure you are you?”</p><p>“Well . . . yes.”</p><p>“Then that’s for you,” said the daemon. “I never make a mistake of
identity.”</p><p>“But how can you be sure?”</p><p>“How can you be sure you are you?”</p><p>“Because I’m right here!”</p><p>“See? It’s only logical.”</p><p>“But I can’t <span class="emphasis"><em>read</em></span> it,” Laurie said. “What does it
say?”</p><p>“How old are you, that you can’t read?” said the daemon. “That’s
a real shame.”</p><p>“But—”</p><p>“Did you know that kids in some countries start reading when they are only 12 months
old?”</p><p>“I <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> read—I just can’t read
<span class="emphasis"><em>this</em></span>. It’s gibberish!”</p><p>“That,” said the daemon, putting his riding gloves back on, “sounds like a
whole lot of Not My Problem.”</p><p>“But—”</p><p>“Do you accept delivery? Or do I have to bounce it?”</p><p>“Well, yes, but—”</p><p>“Look, Miss Well-Yes-But. I’m a mail delivery daemon. I work for the Colonel. My
job is to deliver messages. What the message says is Not My Problem. Good day!” The daemon
sped away, his tires spitting dirt and gravel all over her.</p><p>“<span class="emphasis"><em>Ooh!</em></span>” Laurie was so mad that she actually stamped her foot.
“That little d-d—”</p><p>“What is it, Laurie?” asked Xor, who had been napping in her pocket.</p><p>“I think it’s a message for me,” she said. “But I don’t
understand it at all.”</p><p>“A secret message!” Xor said, rubbing his little claws together. “It’s
lucky for you that my mother’s half-brother is a Cryptosaurus.”</p><p>“A what-asaurus?”</p><p>“A <span class="emphasis"><em>Crypto</em></span>saurus. We know everything there is to know about secret
messages. Let’s see what we’ve got here.” Xor crawled onto the message for a
closer look. The paper was white, so of course his skin turned black.</p><p>“Hmm. This is a hard one. I don’t recognize these letters at all.”</p><p>“Why are you looking at it upside down?” Laurie asked him.</p><p>“Of course, well, uh, sometimes you can see patterns in secret messages that way.”
He turned the right way around.</p><p>“Now, um, let’s read it through slowly and look for clues. Con-sec-te-tour
a-dee-peace-ick-ing el . . .” Xor’s skin rippled as he moved across the letters.
“. . . dew-is ow-tay . . .”</p><p>“Hey, Xor, wait a second.” Laurie had noticed something odd. “Back up just a
little.”</p><p>“Like this?”</p><p>“Yeah. Now, think really hard about blending in.”</p><p>“Okay. What do you see?” he said.</p><p>“Your skin. I think I can read it.”</p><p>When Xor was lined up just right, L<span class="smaller">OREM</span> I<span class="smaller">PSUM</span> E<span class="smaller">SXIHU</span> in black on white became
<span class="gray-background">L<span class="smaller">AUREN</span> I<span class="smaller">PSUM</span> G<span class="smaller">REETINGS</span></span> in white on
black.</p><p>“You are unhiding the message!”</p><p>“Really? I mean, see? I told you I could do it.”</p><p>“You are wonderful, Xor! Can you get closer to the paper?”</p><p>“If I were any closer, I’d be behind it!”</p><p>Word by word, they unscrambled the message. But even then it didn’t make much
sense:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>L<span class="smaller">AUREN</span> I<span class="smaller">PSUM</span>,

The map is not the territory? What does that even mean?”
Laurie asked.</p><p>“I once heard of a king who wanted to make a perfect map of his territory,” said
Xor.</p><p>“Why did he want to do that?”</p><p>“Kings always want something silly, like a book about everything or a chariot with no
weak parts,” he said. “This king decided that he wanted a perfect map as large as his
kingdom. That way, the royal cartographers could fit <span class="emphasis"><em>everything</em></span> in, down to the
last pebble and flower. It took seven whole years to finish it. But it was a disaster!”</p><p>“Why? What happened?” Laurie asked.</p><p>“As a map, it didn’t work very well. To measure the distance between two places,
you had to travel exactly that distance,” the lizard explained. “By that time you were
already there.”</p><p>“Where did they even put such a big map?”</p><p>“That was the other thing. King Borges had only one kingdom, so there was nowhere to put
the map except right where it was. It was a huge bother, what with the map sitting on top of
people’s houses, and none of the crops could grow. The people finally overthrew the king and
tore up the map. They say you can still see huge pieces of paper blowing around in the
desert.”</p></div></body></html>

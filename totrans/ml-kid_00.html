<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="OpenerCap"><img src="Images/Alphabet-I.png" alt="Alphabet-I" class="dropcap"/></span>n this book, you’ll be building ML projects using a free educational tool called Machine Learning for Kids. This chapter will introduce how the tool works, how you’ll use it for each project, and how your parent or teacher can set it up for you. </p>
<p>You can find Machine Learning for Kids at <a href="https://MachineLearningForKids.co.uk/" class="LinkURL">https://MachineLearningForKids.co.uk/</a>. It’s a long web address to type, so it’s a good idea to save a bookmark the first time you visit.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="8" id="Page_8"/>The home page is shown in <a id="figureanchor2-1" href="#figure2-1">Figure 2-1</a>. (As with all websites, the design will change slightly over time, so it might look a little different than what’s shown here.)</p>

<h2 id="h1-500563c02-0001">Logging In</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The first step for every project in this book is to go to the Machine Learning for Kids site and log in.</p>
<p>Click <b>Log In</b> in the top menu bar. You’ll see the login screen shown in <a id="figureanchor2-2" href="#figure2-2">Figure 2-2</a>.</p>

<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="9" id="Page_9"/>You have two choices here:</p>
<ol class="none">
<li><span class="RunInHead">Log in</span>  If your parent or teacher has already created a free account for you, click <b>Log in</b> and enter your username and password. Logging in allows you to save your projects and come back to them later.</li>
<li><span class="RunInHead">Try it now</span>  If you don’t have an account yet, click <b>Try it now</b><b/>. You’ll still be able to work on a project, but only for four hours. That’s long enough to complete any of the projects in this book, but you won’t be able to come back to them later. </li>
</ol>
<p>The Sign up button, where your parent or teacher creates a free account for you, is explained in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_“Creating an Account” on page 14">“Creating an Account” on page 14</span>.</p>
<h2 id="h1-500563c02-0002">Creating a New ML Project </h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Once you’ve logged in, you’ll be taken to a list of your projects, shown in <a id="figureanchor2-3" href="#figure2-3">Figure 2-3</a>. You can get back to this list at any time by clicking Projects in the top menu bar. </p>

<p>To create a new project, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li value="1">Click <b>Add a new project</b> (see <a href="#figure2-3">Figure 2-3</a>).</li>
<li value="2">Type a name for your project in the Project Name text box, shown in <a id="figureanchor2-4" href="#figure2-4">Figure 2-4</a>.

<li value="3">Click <b>Recognising</b>, shown in <a href="#figure2-4">Figure 2-4</a>. You should see a drop-down list of different types of ML projects (<a id="figureanchor2-5" href="#figure2-5">Figure 2-5</a>). This is where you select the category (for example, text or images) you want to teach the computer to recognize. Each project in the book will tell you which option to choose here.

</ol>
<h2 id="h1-500563c02-0003">Phases of an ML Project</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">There are three main phases to each project: Train, Learn &amp; Test, and Make (see <a id="figureanchor2-7" href="#figure2-7">Figure 2-7</a>). </p>
<p>You can switch to each phase by clicking its blue button. The project instructions will tell you when it’s time to move on to each phase.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Images/f02007.png" alt="f02007"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure2-7" href="#figureanchor2-7">Figure 2-7:</a> Phases of an ML project</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="h2-500563c02-0001">Train</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">In the Train phase, you collect examples of what you want the computer to learn to recognize. </p>
<p>You’ll create a bucket for each subcategory you’re training the computer to recognize. Each bucket has a gray border, as shown in <a id="figureanchor2-8" href="#figure2-8">Figure 2-8</a>. </p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" title="12" id="Page_12"/><figure>
<img src="Images/f02008.png" alt="f02008"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure2-8" href="#figureanchor2-8">Figure 2-8:</a> The Train phase</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Next, you’ll fill those buckets with examples. For text projects, that means collecting examples of writing that fall into each subcategory. In <a href="#figure2-8">Figure 2-8</a>, the buckets include text examples of the subcategories <em>something</em> and <em>something_else</em>. (In a real project, for the text subcategory <em>kind</em>, you might add examples of compliments, while for the text subcategory <em>mean</em>, you might add insults.) For image projects, you’ll fill the buckets with examples of pictures that illustrate the subcategory. For sound projects, you’ll collect examples of sound recordings that fit the subcategory.</p>
<p>The number at the bottom right of each bucket is a handy counter showing you how many examples you’ve collected so far.</p>
<p>If you’ve added an example to a bucket by accident and want to get rid of it, move your mouse pointer over it and click the red X. </p>
<p>If you want to remove an entire bucket, including all of its training examples, move your mouse pointer over the top-right corner of the bucket and click the red X. Be sure about this, because there’s no way to get a bucket back once you’ve deleted it! </p>
<h3 id="h2-500563c02-0002">Learn &amp; Test</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Once you’ve collected enough examples, you’re ready to use them to train an ML <em>model</em>. (The next chapter explains more about models.) </p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="13" id="Page_13"/>To start the training process, click <b>Train new machine learning model</b> (see <a id="figureanchor2-9" href="#figure2-9">Figure 2-9</a>).</p>
<figure>
<img src="Images/f02009.png" alt="f02009"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure2-9" href="#figureanchor2-9">Figure 2-9:</a> Training a model</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>How long this process takes depends on the type of project and the number of examples you’ve collected. Image projects take longer than text projects (because it’s much harder for computers to understand images than to understand text or numbers). The more examples you have, the longer training will take. And sometimes the ML computer server will be busy and take a little longer. </p>
<p>The training process might take 30 seconds, or it might take a few minutes. Please be patient! There’s a quiz at the bottom of the page to try while you wait.  </p>
<p>If you haven’t collected enough examples, you won’t see the Train new machine learning model button. Go back to the Train phase to add more examples. </p>
<h3 id="h2-500563c02-0003">Make</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Once you have an ML model, you can make something with it.</p>
<p>There are different types of projects that you can build, but all of the projects in this book use Scratch 3. Click <b>Scratch 3</b> as shown in <a id="figureanchor2-10" href="#figure2-10">Figure 2-10</a>.</p>

<p>Now you’re ready to get started with the projects in this book! But remember, if you want to use the Log in option (instead of Try it now) so that you can save your projects, you’ll need to ask an adult to create an account for you. Let’s go over that now.</p>
<h2 id="h1-500563c02-0004">Creating an Account </h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Creating an account is free and only has to be done once. There are 10 steps, and signing up can take up to 10 minutes. This section covers the instructions your parent, teacher, or coding club leader needs to follow. </p>
<aside epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="top hr"><hr/></div>
<section class="note">

<p>The adult creating the account will need to provide an email address. For information about how the email address will be used, they can go to <a href="https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/help/" class="LinkURL">https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/help/</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h1-500563c02-0005"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="17" id="Page_17"/>What You Learned</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Machine Learning for Kids is the free tool you’ll be using for the projects in this book. The tool guides you through the main phases of an ML project. The project instructions will tell you exactly what to do at each phase and when you should move on to the next phase or return to a previous one.</p>
<p>If you want to be able to save your projects, you’ll need an adult to create an account for you. Creating an account is a little complicated and can take 10 minutes or so, but the process is free, only has to be done once, and is explained in detail online.  </p>

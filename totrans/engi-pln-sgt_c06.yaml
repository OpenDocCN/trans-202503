    revolve around water. Not only is water a physiological necessity, but it also
    serves as a source of power, a means of transportation for goods and passengers,
    and an excellent place for recreational activities. It serves as a habitat for
    a multitude of aquatic plants and animals as well. On the other hand, water can
    be destructive, creating floods that damage property and jeopardize public safety,
    and eroding riverbanks and shorelines. With its absolute necessity and ever-present
    threat, it’s no surprise that much of our infrastructure is devoted to controlling
    and managing water.

    water. We’ve built enormous dams to create reservoirs that store freshwater, vast
    networks of waterways for maritime navigation, and gigantic flood control and
    coastal protection features around the world. Many of these facilities even attract
    enough attention and public interest to warrant their own tourism centers that
    provide a safe vantage for observation and opportunities to learn about their
    history and technical details. The next time you pass by a major dam, port, lock,

    dynamic places in the world. Shores are subject to a vast array of natural disruptive
    forces, including wind, waves, tides, ocean currents, and storms. Humans also
    impact shorelines by dredging channels, building waterways, developing structures
    along the coast, and trapping sediment in upland reservoirs before it can reach
    the shore. It’s no wonder that our coastlines shift and transform over time. The
    soil and rock that make up the coastline are in constant flux, endlessly stolen
    from one place and deposited somewhere else.

    Many of our largest cities sit along the coast because of the opportunity provided
    by shipping and fishing. In addition, beaches support local economies, providing
    millions of jobs and billions of dollars of economic activity around the world
    through tourism. Shoreline erosion is a constant menace to our infrastructure,
    developed areas, and navigational waterways, threatening structures along the
    shore and the livelihood of vast portions of coastal populations. Much of coastal
    engineering focuses on ways we can protect the shoreline and combat the disruptive
    forces that cause it to change and disappear over time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the most basic coastal structures is a revetment, a simple layer of hard
    armor atop a natural slope. Revetments usually feature large stones or concrete
    blocks that can withstand the constant force of crashing waves and tidal currents.
    Using blocks or stones can also absorb the energy of each wave, reducing the distance
    it travels up the slope. Similar to a revetment, a seawall is a vertical structure
    parallel to the shore, protecting upland areas against erosion. Seawalls are usually
    constructed using reinforced concrete. Many seawalls feature a shape called a
    *recurve* to redirect wave energy back toward the sea, reducing the likelihood
    of water crashing over the top. Seawalls are usually constructed to an elevation
    above the normal high tide to protect against flooding and storm surges. They
    typically separate the developed areas they protect above from the sandy beaches
    below.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Breakwaters are another type of parallel structure used to protect areas of
    the shore from waves. Unlike revetments and seawalls, they aren’t connected to
    the shore. Instead, breakwaters are constructed offshore to dissipate wave energy
    and create areas of tranquil water for ships and structures along the coast, called
    harbors. Breakwaters can be made from many materials, but they are most commonly
    mounds of rock rubble. Often the core of the breakwater uses smaller rocks to
    reduce the flow of wave energy through the structure, while the outside layer
    consists of larger stones that can better withstand the waves.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another protective structure, called a groin, protrudes into the sea to combat
    *longshore drift*, the process of sediment movement parallel to the coast. Like
    breakwaters, groins are usually made using mounds of rock or rubble. Over time,
    a groin will trap sand suspended in ocean currents to create a beach (a process
    called *accretion*). If properly sized, a groin can also protect the area on the
    downdrift side by reducing the speed and power of ocean currents along the shore.
    However, an oversized groin will rob currents of all their sediment, leaving none
    to replenish the beaches beyond and thus accelerating erosion along unprotected
    shores. After one groin is built, additional groins are commonly needed to protect
    the downdrift area, eventually leading to saw-toothed beaches extending for great
    distances.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similar to groins, jetties are structures constructed perpendicular to the coast.
    They are often built in pairs to protect the inlet to a navigation channel by
    extending its mouth into the sea. Not only do they block the passage of sediment
    into the channel, but they also confine the flow of seawater within during tide
    changes, speeding it up to flush sediment from the bottom and minimize its accumulation.

- en: These hard armoring structures often provide a long-term solution to erosion,
    but they can also create unintended consequences. For just one example, smooth
    concrete seawalls reflect waves rather than absorb them, potentially worsening
    erosion farther down the shore. These structures can also affect the quality of
    habitat in the sea, creating environmental challenges. When possible, coastal
    engineers look toward “softer” solutions to erosion. One of those techniques involves
    planting or maintaining trees and shrubs that can grow in the tidal zones along
    coasts. These are called mangrove forests, and their dense networks of roots absorb
    wave energy and protect the soil along the coast.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another soft solution to coastal erosion is to create artificial reefs that
    provide habitat for fish, corals, and other marine life. Many materials have been
    used to construct artificial reefs, including rocks, concrete, shipwrecks, and
    even submerged subway cars. These reefs offer surfaces where marine organisms
    can attach or hide, with a secondary benefit of dissipating wave energy offshore,
    serving as submerged breakwaters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yet another soft solution is to reverse the process of erosion by replacing
    the material that has been lost, a technique commonly known as beach nourishment.
    Beaches are not only essential recreation areas and economic drivers, but they
    also serve as buffers between development and the sea. They dissipate the energy
    from storms and waves before it can reach developed areas, but sand can be moved
    downdrift or pulled out into deeper waters in the process. Replenishing lost sand
    protects coastal structures and creates spaces for recreation. Nourishment is
    often accomplished by borrowing sediments from the seafloor with a dredge and
    pumping them back to the shore as a *slurry* of water and sand in a pipeline.
    The slurry is discharged ashore into a large basin to allow the water to drain
    and sand to settle out, after which it can be spread along the beach using earth-moving
    equipment. Beach nourishment has environmental impacts, and it’s not a permanent
    solution, but it is a popular tool for addressing coastal erosion.

    is to let nature do what it does best: allowing the coastline to be vibrant and
    dynamic, which is what draws humans to it in the first place.'

    long distances by boat as much nowadays due to lack of speed, but *shipping* got
    its name for a reason. We still use ships to move vast quantities of cargo around
    the world every day, maintaining complex supply chains of raw materials to finished
    goods. Waterway transportation persists because ships are efficient. Even the
    most massive of consignments are practically effortless to move once floating
    on water. Moving one ton of goods the same distance on a boat takes roughly half
    the amount of energy that it would by train and approximately a fifth of the energy
    it would take on a truck. In addition, shipping is the primary way goods can move
    across portions of the globe that aren’t connected by land.

    In the simplest terms, a port is a place where a ship can dock, but that straightforward
    function belies the enormous complexity of modern maritime facilities. Ports are
    found not only in cities along the coast but also in cities along rivers and inland
    waterways. They usually consist of multiple *terminals* where loading and unloading
    of goods—or people, in the case of cruise ships—take place. Each terminal is engineered
    to move a specific type of goods on and off ships quickly and efficiently. *Bulk
    carriers*, which transport unpackaged cargo like grains and ore, are serviced
    using large conveyors or bucket cranes. *Tankers*, which carry liquids like oil,
    are filled and drained by massive hoses. Most cargo ships that move packaged goods
    use containers, standardized steel boxes that can be easily transferred between
    trains, trucks, and other vessels using cranes.'

    port with its gigantic cranes and colorful stacks of steel boxes. The enormous
    ship-to-shore cranes usually sit atop rails so they can traverse the length of
    a cargo ship, loading or unloading containers as quickly as one every two minutes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes containers are moved directly between modes of travel (mainly truck,
    train, or another ship), but often they must be stored in the yard before their
    onward vehicle arrives. Containerization of cargo creates a puzzle since only
    the top container in each stack is accessible. Getting to the bottom of the stack
    requires relocating everything above. Computerized management systems optimize
    the placement of each container to reduce the number of movements it takes to
    deliver them to their destinations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A wide variety of vehicles are used to handle and move containers within the
    terminal, and their control is increasingly being automated in modern ports. Terminal
    tractors (known by many names, including *hustlers*) are small semi-trucks that
    carry containers around the yard. Automated guided vehicles perform the same function
    but without the human driver. Reach stackers and straddle carriers can transport
    and lift containers to and from the top of a stack. Gantry cranes ride over long
    rows of stacked containers. Instead of hooks, these vehicles all use a device
    called a *spreader* to lift each container. Every box is equipped with reinforced
    corner castings. Four twist locks engage into oval-shaped holes in each casting.
    The twist locks rotate 90 degrees, securely connecting the spreader to the container.
    Ingenious in their simplicity, twist lock mechanisms are installed on ship decks,
    trucks, and trains, and between each container in a stack. They are responsible
    for locking millions of hulking steel boxes into place each day.

    that serves as the edge of the terminal is usually called a *wharf* or *quay*.
    The wharf may include one or more *berths*, which are parking spots for ships.
    Each berth includes several large bollards to which the ship’s mooring lines are
    attached. *Winches* on the ship keep these lines taut to minimize movement during
    loading and unloading. In addition, fenders along each berth serve as cushions
    to protect both the wharf and the vessel’s hull from damage. Traditionally, old
    tires were used as fenders, but modern ports use devices specifically designed
    for the types and sizes of ships serviced.

- en: One of the most critical decisions in the design of a port facility is the largest
    ship that can be accommodated, called the *design vessel*. Accommodating larger
    ships makes port facilities more expensive to construct and maintain, but it can
    bring more traffic and more revenue, so it’s a careful balance. The design vessel
    length determines the length of each berth and the overall size of the harbor.
    Its beam affects the size of the booms on the ship-to-shore cranes used to load
    and unload, and its draft determines the minimum depth of the harbor below. This
    depth is maintained by dredging sediment from the waterway floor using excavators
    or suction pipes. Designers of ships (called *naval architects*) try to make them
    as large as possible while still fitting into the canals, locks, and ports they
    will encounter. In fact, many ship types are named for the facility into which
    they will barely fit; for example, Suezmax ships are the largest vessels capable
    of transiting the Suez Canal.

    currents, and the extreme forces of ships’ mooring lines day in, day out. In addition,
    they must be quite tall to allow enormous ships to dock directly alongside. Many
    wharves are built on fill, soil brought to the site and compacted in place to
    serve as a firm foundation. A retaining wall reinforces the fill while allowing
    ships access to the edge. When site geology isn’t ideal for supporting the weight
    of port equipment and cargo, a wharf may be supported on piles. These vertical
    steel or concrete elements are drilled or driven deep into the underlying soil
    to keep the wharf from settling or shifting over time.

    Floating devices, called buoys, delineate navigable waterways and hazards. Just
    like road signs, they use standardized colors and symbols to communicate rules

    has enough slack to absorb shock loads from waves, wind, and current and accommodate
    changes in level from tides. The anchor can be a heavy weight, called a sinker,
    or a device driven or drilled into the underlying soil.

    by boat. We’ve overcome this obstacle somewhat using constructed waterways or
    canals. The earliest works of written history describe canals and shipping. Even
    thousands of years ago, humans sought to bring access by boat to areas otherwise
    inaccessible. Another limitation is more difficult to surmount, however. Water
    is self-leveling. Unlike roads or rail, you can’t lay water on a slope to get
    up or down a hill. An ideal canal would sit at the same level for its entire length,
    but in areas with steep terrain, that would require so much excavation that it
    would be practically impossible. Rather than cut massive canyons to keep canals
    at a consistent elevation, we move ships up or down to different levels like steps
    on a staircase using navigation *locks*.

- en: A lock consists of a watertight chamber with large gates at either end. The
    way a lock works is quite simple. A ship going up enters the mostly empty chamber,
    and the lower gate is closed. Then water from above is allowed to fill the space,
    raising the vessel. Once the level in the lock reaches that of the upper canal,
    the upper gate can be fully opened, and the ship can continue on its way. Going
    down follows the same steps, but in reverse. A ship enters the filled chamber,
    the upper gate is closed, and the water in the lock is allowed to drain. Once
    the level in the chamber matches that of the lower canal, the lower gate can be
    fully opened, and the ship can continue onward. It’s an entirely reversible lift
    system that, in its simplest form, requires no external source of power to work,
    except for the water itself.

    floodwaters when needed. Most modern locks that accommodate large ships are built
    from reinforced concrete. They have walls and a floor, just like a gigantic bathtub.
    The approaches to the lock are designed to be straight with no crosscurrents so
    ships can easily line up to enter the chamber. Small locks used for recreational
    boats can often be self-operated, but large locks on busy waterways have operations
    staff to lift and lower ships 24 hours per day.

- en: The gates on each side of the lock chamber are engineering marvels themselves.
    Most locks use miter gates. They are composed of two leaves, like enormous, hinged
    doors that close toward the center. Instead of closing in a straight line, the
    leaves meet at an angle pointing upstream. Pressure from the water above forces
    the gates tightly closed, keeping them sealed and leak-free during the operation
    of the lock. In some places, particularly those affected by tides, it is possible
    for the downstream level to rise above that in the upper canal. In such a situation,
    miter gates would not function properly. Sector gates provide an alternative to
    miter gates that can handle water pressure from both directions. Sector gates
    are shaped like slices of pie that hinge at their points and meet in the center.
    Some modern locks employ gates that roll open and closed instead of using hinges.
    Rolling gates benefit from sliding into a recess that can be pumped dry for maintenance
    and repairs (rather than needing to remove each gate entirely).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In all locks, the lower gate is the real workhorse. The upper gate must only
    be tall enough to allow ships to enter the chamber when filled. The lower gate
    must hold back water from the very top to the bottom of the chamber. Water pressure
    increases with depth, so locks with a significant rise require the lower gate
    to withstand extreme forces. When a canal needs to ascend a substantial elevation
    difference, multiple smaller locks in series (called a *flight*) are used rather
    than a single large lock.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The plumbing required to fill and empty a lock chamber is another essential
    part of its engineering. Many locks are choke points to waterway traffic, so operators
    try to minimize the time it takes a ship to get through. Imagine the challenge
    of filling and draining a gigantic swimming pool 30 or more times per day while
    people are in the pool. Similarly, you can’t just open the upper gate and let
    the water flow in. For one, the difference in water levels creates so much pressure
    that opening the gate is practically impossible. More important, the in- or outrush
    of water would endanger ships transiting through the lock. Instead, most locks
    use a separate system to fill and drain the chamber. The simplest option is to
    have a smaller shutter, sometimes called a *paddle*, in each gate that can be
    opened and closed. Large locks use culverts to move water through ports in the
    sides or bottom of the chamber. Two valves control the flow. The lock is filled
    by opening the valve at the upper gate, and the chamber is drained by opening
    the one at the lower gate. The ports are carefully designed to move as much water
    as possible without creating dangerous turbulence, jets, or swells within the
    chamber that could capsize a ship.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even with a well-designed filling system, a lock chamber can be a turbulent
    space. Ships need to be moored in place to avoid collisions with the gates or
    walls. However, mooring lines can’t be attached to the tops of the lock walls.
    For a ship moving up, they would immediately become slack. For a ship moving down,
    they could pull the vessel right out of the water! Smaller locks require the boat
    pilot to take in or pay out the lines as the water level rises or falls. Larger
    locks use floating bitts that ride along vertical guides to keep moored vessels
    in place as they ascend or descend.

    aren’t linear. In the main channel, where normal river flows occur, a rise in
    water level creates only a slight increase in the area of inundation. The steep
    banks contain the flow. However, the topography is often wide and flat above the
    channel banks, ideal for farmland and urban development. When the river’s flow
    overtops the banks, even small increases in water level can create broad areas
    of inundation. These areas just above the riverbanks are often called floodplains
    because they are so vulnerable to overbanking flows. One structural solution to
    riverine flooding is to increase the height of the banks to constrain the flow
    of water away from developed areas.

    soil and pile it into an embankment. These structures, called levees or *dikes*,

    coastal areas to protect against storm surge. Although simple in concept, modern
    levees rely on advanced engineering to protect low-lying areas from floods. After
    all, soil is not the strongest of building materials, especially when faced with
    fast-moving water. Engineers specify the slopes and compaction requirements of
    the levee based on the properties of the soil available for construction.

    stone or concrete armoring, called revetments, for additional protection. Because
    earthen embankments can deteriorate over time, maintenance is vital. Levees must
    be kept free of trees and woody vegetation that can be toppled or ripped out during

    many levees and floodwalls are designed to guard against the *100-year flood*,
    a somewhat confusing term for a simple concept. Because we have extensive historical
    records of rainfall worldwide, we can estimate the relationship between any storm’s
    severity and its probability of occurring. The 100-year flood is a reference point
    on that line: a theoretical storm that has a 1 percent chance of being equaled
    or exceeded in a given year at a certain location. Although its name implies that
    it happens only once every hundred years, the 1 percent annual chance equates
    to a 26 percent chance of such a storm occurring within a 30-year window. Over

    engineers use historical flooding records and hydraulic models to estimate how

    and over each wall, so we occasionally leave a gap, called a closure, through
    which a road or railway can pass. Steel gates at each closure must be shut in
    advance of a flood to complete the perimeter. Of course, closures are only feasible
    for areas along major river basins where floods arrive gradually with some warning.
    An open gate can defeat the purpose of a floodwall or levee altogether, so closures

    a way to allow drainage to pass through in one direction without allowing the
    river to backflow into protected areas during floods. Some large-scale systems
    use pumps to move local drainage out of low-lying areas, but pumps can be expensive.
    Pipes, called culverts, can pass through levees and floodwalls, or their foundations,
    to allow drainage of enclosed areas to occur by gravity. These culverts are equipped
    with gates (which must be manually closed during floods) or devices that defend

    later section.) Many large dams serve multiple purposes at once using different
    zones within the reservoir, called *pools*. One pool can be kept full to be used
    for hydropower or water supply, and one above kept empty to be used for storage
    in the event of a flood. If a dam is used to generate electricity, the hydropower
    plant that houses turbines and other equipment is often visible downstream. If
    the plant isn’t connected to the dam, you might also see the large-diameter pipelines
    that deliver water to the turbines, called penstocks.

- en: A dam can be built from many different materials, but many of the largest and
    most iconic structures are made from concrete. (The following section describes
    dams constructed from earth and rock.) Concrete is strong and durable, allowing
    a dam to withstand the tremendous pressure of water in a reservoir. Unlike many
    large structures where loads are vertical from the force of gravity, the most
    significant forces on a dam are horizontal. As the depth of a reservoir increases,
    so does the pressure it exerts on the upstream face of a dam. Water can also leak
    through pores and cracks in a dam’s foundation, creating pressure on the bottom
    of the structure, called uplift. The critical job of withstanding such pressure
    is a major factor in each dam’s design and physical appearance.

- en: Gravity dams oppose the force of impounded water simply with their weight. Concrete
    is quite heavy, and with enough mass, a structure can be stable enough to avoid
    overturning or sliding from horizontal forces. Gravity dams are usually broad
    at their base, where water pressure is highest. They taper up to a narrow crest,
    sometimes just wide enough to drive a vehicle over the top, giving them a characteristic
    slope on the downstream side. Similarly, buttress dams transfer the forces from
    the reservoir into the foundation using triangular buttresses. The water pressure
    still works to push the dam horizontally, but the sloped upstream face takes advantage
    of the water’s weight for stability as well. Buttress dams require less concrete
    to construct, but they also require more labor to form the intricate shapes needed
    for stability, so they are generally not economical in modern times.

- en: Unlike gravity and buttress dams, arch dams transfer much of the force from
    impounded water into the abutments on each side of the dam instead of the foundation.
    Like arch bridges (described in Chapter 4), arch dams take advantage of geometry
    to span a gap. Because they don’t rely as much on their own weight, arch dams
    need less concrete and thus can be more economical to construct. However, they
    can be located only on sites with advantageous geology since the abutments need
    to resist most of the reservoir forces attempting to push the structure downstream.
    Thus, arch dams are most often found in narrow, rocky valleys. Some buttress dams
    are designed as *multiple arch dams*, where each smaller arch is supported by
    a buttress instead of a single arch spanning the entire valley.

- en: Concrete dams are not constructed as one solid block—concrete shrinks as it
    cures from a liquid into a solid, potentially leading to cracks. In addition,
    changes in temperature cause concrete to expand and contract over the course of
    a year, which can also cause cracking. Cracks in a sidewalk or driveway may be
    okay, but in a dam, they can become leaks that weaken and damage the structure.
    Concrete dams are constructed in smaller blocks, called monoliths, with horizontal
    and vertical joints to provide freedom of movement, reducing the likelihood of
    cracking. Unlike random cracks that could form in a solid concrete structure,
    joints are easy to seal against leakage using embedded water stops and sealants.
    Although you can’t see them from the outside, many concrete dams have internal
    tunnels, called galleries, to collect any leaking water and allow engineers to
    monitor the structure’s integrity from the inside. Galleries also provide a location
    for drains that relieve pressure within a dam’s foundation.

    to create storage but simply to raise the level in a river or stream. The depth
    in a natural watercourse varies over time and can be quite shallow for long stretches.
    Low-head dams impound a small volume of water, artificially raising the level
    to make a channel more navigable by boats, increase the depth at intakes for water
    supply and irrigation, or create a drop for powering turbines or waterwheels.
    Low-head dams are often called *weirs* because water flows over the top (rather
    than through a gate or outlet). This overflow can create a significant hazard
    for swimmers and boaters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As the jet of water (called the *nappe*) flows over a low-head dam and plunges
    into the river below, it can create an area of recirculation immediately downstream
    of the dam. This area is sometimes called a keeper because it can trap objects,
    debris, and even people. With strong hydraulic forces, the hard surfaces of the
    dam, disorienting turbulence, and submerged debris, the low-head dam has been
    known as the perfect drowning machine. Many were constructed long ago when mills
    and factories relied on waterpower to drive equipment, and safety was low on the
    list of priorities. Many cities have removed them or converted them into recreational
    features, restoring aquatic ecosystems and drawing outside tourism. If you’re
    swimming or paddling on a river with a low-head dam, don’t underestimate the danger
    of these seemingly innocuous structures.

- en: Although the archetypal dam is a concrete structure, most dams worldwide are
    constructed using earth or rock. Unlike concrete dams that usually require specific
    geology and a nearby source of constituent materials (mainly cement and aggregates),
    *embankment dams* can be constructed in nearly any location. If there are two
    materials in abundant supply on Earth, they’re soil and rock. An embankment dam
    is not just a pile of dirt placed across a river valley, however. Using such primitive
    materials to impound enormous volumes of water safely is a complex engineering
    challenge, and attentive observers can notice many of the intricacies of embankment
    dam design.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Embankment dams can be constructed out of soil, called *earthfill*, or out of
    stones or gravel, called *rockfill*. Both types of material behave much differently
    than concrete. Because they are granular substances composed of individual particles,
    earthfill and rockfill are naturally unstable. Gravity is always trying to pull
    them apart, and the only force holding an embankment together is the friction
    between individual grains or rocks. Large embankments that can stand tall over
    the long term and resist pressure from a reservoir must have gentle slopes on
    the upstream and downstream sides. The necessary slope depends on the properties
    of the material being used, but most earthfill dams have slopes with widths that
    are around three times their height. The slopes of rockfill structures can be
    steeper but rarely less than a two-to-one ratio of width to height. That means
    both earthfill and rockfill embankments have broad footprints that taper as their
    height decreases toward each end. Many also feature a toe berm, an area of additional
    fill along the bottom of one or both slopes to stabilize the structure further.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Soil and rock can’t simply be dumped into place to create a dam. Granular materials
    settle and compress over time, and the height of the pile magnifies this effect.
    We don’t want dams shrinking after they’re built, so fill must be compacted and
    densified during placement to create a firm and stable structure. Compaction speeds
    up the settlement process, so it mostly happens during construction instead of
    afterward. If soil is compacted to its maximum density, that means it won’t settle
    further over time. Modern construction equipment can compact a layer of soil up
    to around 30 centimeters (1 foot) thick at a time. Rolling over thicker layers
    will only densify the surface, leaving the underlying ground loose. So, embankments
    are constructed slowly from the bottom up in individual layers called lifts.

- en: Rockfill and most types of earthfill are permeable materials that can allow
    water to flow right through (a phenomenon called *seepage*). Unlike concrete dams,
    which accomplish both stability and water tightness with one material, embankment
    dams often require additional features to hold a reservoir back. Most earthfill
    dams have different zones of material. The core is constructed using clay soils
    that are highly impermeable to seepage. Depending on the site’s geology, finding
    clay in sufficient volume that meets strict specifications for water tightness
    can be a challenge. The core is typically the costliest part of an embankment
    project, so its dimensions are engineered to be only as large as necessary. The
    outer shells have less stringent specifications because they provide only stability
    and don’t need to be so watertight.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Rockfill dams, being much more porous than earthfill structures, usually include
    a barrier of concrete, asphalt, or clay in the core or along the upstream slope
    to make the embankment impervious to seepage. In addition, although not visible
    from the outside, many embankment dams feature some kind of cutoff wall into the
    foundation. This wall is often constructed from concrete or a clay slurry to close
    any paths that seepage could take from the reservoir through the dam’s foundation.

- en: The repeated force of waves crashing against a vulnerable earthen structure
    can create erosion and deterioration. Therefore, nearly all large earthfill dams
    will have some kind of armoring on the upstream face to protect against long-term
    damage from waves. Often this armoring consists of a thick layer of rocks called
    riprap. A layer of smaller gravel called bedding sits between the dam and larger
    rocks to prevent soil from washing out from under the riprap. Alternatively, many
    dams use a mixture of onsite soil and cement, forming an inexpensive but durable
    armoring called soil-cement. It is often placed in lifts along the upstream face
    of embankments, forming a characteristic stair-stepped appearance.
  prefs: []

    to protect against erosion from rainfall runoff. With their gentle grassy slopes,
    many embankment dams appear at first glance to be a natural part of the landscape.

    dam is there at all, except for the perfectly level crest, which often gives it

    massive structures usually isn’t worth the cost. Instead, engineers make sure
    that leaks don’t cause problems through the use of drains. Most drains consist
    of two parts: the filter keeps seepage from washing away soil particles using
    layers of gravel or sand, and perforated collector pipes within the filter gather
    and discharge any water that finds its way into the drain so that it can’t build
    up pressure. If you see small pipes exiting the downstream side of the dam, they
    are often outlets to the structure’s internal drainage system.'

    areas nearby. *Off-channel reservoirs* are those created by building a circular
    dam to contain the stored water fully. They must be filled using pumps from a
    nearby source of water (usually a river). They are often more expensive because
    the dam must surround the entire perimeter. Still, off-channel reservoirs are
    less disruptive to the natural environment because they don’t create a barrier
    across a river, and they can be constructed on less sensitive sites.

    water as well, whether it’s because the water is needed or to protect the dam
    from becoming overfull. There are a variety of different structures that can be
    used to discharge water from a dam safely, depending on the purpose and capacity.
    Releasing water is a dynamic process, so spillways and outlet works are often
    the most complex components of a dam.
  prefs: []

- en: Although the terminology can vary, *outlet works* are generally the facilities
    that release water from a reservoir to meet downstream needs. Some reservoir outlets
    deliver water to a pump station that sends it through pipelines for irrigation
    or to a treatment plant for drinking water in populated areas. Others provide
    water to the penstocks of hydropower plants. Still others release water back into
    the river so it can be withdrawn downstream or be used to maintain the aquatic
    ecosystems below the dam.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    submerged below the reservoir. They are usually located near the center of a dam
    where the water is deepest. For concrete dams with vertical upstream faces, the
    outlet works may be inside the dam itself. Because embankment dams slope away
    from the center, outlet works are often installed as a separate tower farther
    into the reservoir. A bridge usually connects the tower to the dam’s crest to
    provide access for personnel and vehicles.
  prefs: []

    of water. Before reaching them, usually water must first pass through a trash
    rack that prevents debris from entering any facilities where it could cause damage.
    The trash racks on pump station and hydropower intakes often use fine screens
    to keep fish from being drawn in.

- en: Many types of gates and valves can control water through an outlet. A gate that’s
    stuck open or closed can cause severe consequences, so most outlets use a series
    of flow controls to provide redundancy and facilitate regular maintenance. Most
    outlets deliver water through the dam inside a large conduit made from reinforced
    concrete or steel. One common type of gate used on outlets is a *slide gate*,
    which consists of a metal leaf that can be moved up or down across an opening.
    A stem connects the leaf to an operator, often using a motor to lift or lower
    the assembly. The quality and temperature of water in a reservoir can vary depending
    on the depth below the surface, so outlet towers often feature multiple gates
    at different levels, allowing operators to select the elevation at which water
    is drawn.

- en: One of the greatest risks to dams are floods. Building a dam so tall that it
    can store the most extreme volumes of floodwater possible isn’t practical. On
    the other hand, a reservoir must never be allowed to overtop a dam because the
    water will erode and damage the structure and its foundation. So, all dams are
    designed with at least one spillway, a structure that can safely discharge water
    downstream when the reservoir is already full.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because of the inflow variability, many large dams have two or more spillways.
    The smaller one is called the *principal* or *service spillway* that passes normal
    inflows when the reservoir is full. The other is called the *auxiliary* or emergency
    spillway that engages only during extreme events. Depending on the design, the
    auxiliary spillway may flow for only a few scary moments in a dam’s entire lifetime,
    so it can be as simple as an excavated channel cut through an abutment. Sometimes
    an entire section of the dam is armored to allow it to serve as the spillway,
    called *overtopping protection*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Uncontrolled spillways regulate the reservoir level using a *weir*, a structure
    that allows water to pass over its fixed crest. The volume of water discharged
    is strictly related to the level of the reservoir and the spillway’s size and
    shape. Many uncontrolled spillways use a curved profile over the crest, called
    an ogee, which increases the volume that can be discharged for a given length
    and flow depth. Some dams use a type of circular weir, called a morning glory,
    that discharges into a conduit. This type of spillway is used in narrow canyons
    where there isn’t room for a more conventional overflow.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Controlled spillways use gates to manage discharges. Gates add complexity to
    a spillway, but they can also reduce its cost by providing flexibility in discharge
    capacity, allowing for a smaller overall structure. Tainter gates have long arms
    and a curved face, and they pivot around a type of hinge called a trunnion. A
    hoist above the gate lifts the structure via chains or wire ropes to allow water
    to flow underneath. Crest gates pivot at their bottom and are often operated using
    hydraulic cylinders. Some gates even rely on large rubber bladders that can be
    inflated with compressed air or water to raise and lower. All gates require regular
    inspection and maintenance, so most spillways have stoplog slots installed upstream.
    Stoplogs are steel beams that can be installed in the slots using a crane to block
    the water so that a gate can be isolated for maintenance (called *dewatering*).

    the reservoir and natural watercourse downstream, picking up speed as it falls.
    In an open channel spillway, the water travels down the chute, and training walls
    keep the flow contained. Fast-moving water has destructive power that can erode
    and damage a dam if not carefully controlled, which means both spillways and outlet
    works need a way to dissipate hydraulic energy and slow down the flow before releasing
    it into a natural watercourse.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many types of energy dissipation structures are used on spillways and outlet
    works. Flows traveling in a conduit may use an impact basin, which crashes the
    water against a solid concrete wall. Baffled chutes use blocks to slow down the
    water as it travels downward. Plunge pools allow water to fall into a large, armored
    hole before leaving in the downstream channel. Larger spillways sometimes feature
    a flip bucket at the end of the chute to launch the flow into the air where it
    breaks into a fine spray. Finally, many spillways use a structure called a stilling
    basin to protect the dam’s foundation from erosion. Stilling basins rely on a
    phenomenon called a hydraulic jump that occurs when fast-flowing water transitions
    into a slower stream. Most stilling basins use different combinations of baffle
    blocks to force a hydraulic jump to form. The turbulent jump stays within the
    stilling basin, allowing a smooth, tranquil flow to leave downstream and minimizing
    the potential for erosion that otherwise would threaten the structure’s integrity.

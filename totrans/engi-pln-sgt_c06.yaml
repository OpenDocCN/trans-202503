- en: Like the air we breathe, it’s easy to take for granted that our lives practically
    revolve around water. Not only is water a physiological necessity, but it also
    serves as a source of power, a means of transportation for goods and passengers,
    and an excellent place for recreational activities. It serves as a habitat for
    a multitude of aquatic plants and animals as well. On the other hand, water can
    be destructive, creating floods that damage property and jeopardize public safety,
    and eroding riverbanks and shorelines. With its absolute necessity and ever-present
    threat, it’s no surprise that much of our infrastructure is devoted to controlling
    and managing water.

    coastal protection features around the world. Many of these facilities even attract
    enough attention and public interest to warrant their own tourism centers that
    provide a safe vantage for observation and opportunities to learn about their

- en: Coastlines may look static and unmoving on a map, but they are some of the most
    dynamic places in the world. Shores are subject to a vast array of natural disruptive
    forces, including wind, waves, tides, ocean currents, and storms. Humans also
    impact shorelines by dredging channels, building waterways, developing structures
    along the coast, and trapping sediment in upland reservoirs before it can reach
    the shore. It’s no wonder that our coastlines shift and transform over time. The
    soil and rock that make up the coastline are in constant flux, endlessly stolen
    from one place and deposited somewhere else.

    millions of jobs and billions of dollars of economic activity around the world
    through tourism. Shoreline erosion is a constant menace to our infrastructure,
    developed areas, and navigational waterways, threatening structures along the
    shore and the livelihood of vast portions of coastal populations. Much of coastal
    engineering focuses on ways we can protect the shoreline and combat the disruptive
    forces that cause it to change and disappear over time.

- en: One of the most basic coastal structures is a revetment, a simple layer of hard
    armor atop a natural slope. Revetments usually feature large stones or concrete
    blocks that can withstand the constant force of crashing waves and tidal currents.
    Using blocks or stones can also absorb the energy of each wave, reducing the distance
    it travels up the slope. Similar to a revetment, a seawall is a vertical structure
    parallel to the shore, protecting upland areas against erosion. Seawalls are usually
    constructed using reinforced concrete. Many seawalls feature a shape called a
    *recurve* to redirect wave energy back toward the sea, reducing the likelihood
    of water crashing over the top. Seawalls are usually constructed to an elevation
    above the normal high tide to protect against flooding and storm surges. They
    typically separate the developed areas they protect above from the sandy beaches
    below.

  zh: 最基本的海岸结构之一是护坡，它是在自然坡度上覆盖的一层硬质护甲。护坡通常由大块石头或混凝土块构成，能够承受不断撞击的波浪和潮流的力量。使用石块或混凝土块还能吸收每一波浪的能量，减少波浪向坡顶的传播距离。与护坡类似，海堤是一种与海岸平行的垂直结构，用于保护上方的陆地免受侵蚀。海堤通常由加固混凝土建造。许多海堤具有一种叫做*弯曲*的形状，能够将波浪能量引导回海中，减少水流越过海堤的可能性。海堤通常建造在高于正常高潮的高度，以防止洪水和风暴潮。它们通常将它们保护的开发区与下面的沙滩隔开。
- en: Breakwaters are another type of parallel structure used to protect areas of
    the shore from waves. Unlike revetments and seawalls, they aren’t connected to
    the shore. Instead, breakwaters are constructed offshore to dissipate wave energy
    and create areas of tranquil water for ships and structures along the coast, called
    harbors. Breakwaters can be made from many materials, but they are most commonly
    mounds of rock rubble. Often the core of the breakwater uses smaller rocks to
    reduce the flow of wave energy through the structure, while the outside layer
    consists of larger stones that can better withstand the waves.

  zh: 防波堤是另一种用于保护海岸区域免受海浪侵害的平行结构。与护坡和海堤不同，它们不与海岸相连。相反，防波堤建造在海上，以消散波浪能量，并为沿海的船只和建筑物创造平静水域区域，这些区域被称为港口。防波堤可以由多种材料制成，但最常见的是由岩石碎石堆砌而成。防波堤的核心通常使用较小的岩石，以减少波浪能量通过结构的流动，而外层则由较大的石块组成，这些石块能更好地抵御波浪。
- en: Another protective structure, called a groin, protrudes into the sea to combat
    *longshore drift*, the process of sediment movement parallel to the coast. Like
    breakwaters, groins are usually made using mounds of rock or rubble. Over time,
    a groin will trap sand suspended in ocean currents to create a beach (a process
    called *accretion*). If properly sized, a groin can also protect the area on the
    downdrift side by reducing the speed and power of ocean currents along the shore.
    However, an oversized groin will rob currents of all their sediment, leaving none
    to replenish the beaches beyond and thus accelerating erosion along unprotected
    shores. After one groin is built, additional groins are commonly needed to protect
    the downdrift area, eventually leading to saw-toothed beaches extending for great
    distances.

  zh: 另一种保护性结构叫做堤坝，它伸入海中，以对抗*长岸漂移*，即沉积物沿海岸平行移动的过程。与防波堤类似，堤坝通常由岩石或碎石堆砌而成。随着时间的推移，堤坝会捕捉到海洋流动中的悬浮沙子，从而形成沙滩（这个过程叫做*沉积*）。如果尺寸合适，堤坝还可以通过减缓海流沿海岸的速度和力量来保护下游区域。然而，过大的堤坝会使海流失去所有沉积物，无法补充海滩上的沙子，从而加剧了未保护海岸的侵蚀。建造一个堤坝后，通常需要修建更多的堤坝来保护下游区域，最终形成延伸很长的锯齿形沙滩。
- en: Similar to groins, jetties are structures constructed perpendicular to the coast.
    They are often built in pairs to protect the inlet to a navigation channel by
    extending its mouth into the sea. Not only do they block the passage of sediment
    into the channel, but they also confine the flow of seawater within during tide
    changes, speeding it up to flush sediment from the bottom and minimize its accumulation.

  zh: 与堤坝类似，码头是垂直于海岸线建造的结构。它们通常成对修建，以保护航道入口，通过将其口延伸至海洋来防止沉积物进入航道。它们不仅阻止了沉积物进入航道，还限制了海水在潮汐变化中的流动，加速了水流，从而冲刷底部沉积物并减少其积聚。
- en: These hard armoring structures often provide a long-term solution to erosion,
    but they can also create unintended consequences. For just one example, smooth
    concrete seawalls reflect waves rather than absorb them, potentially worsening
    erosion farther down the shore. These structures can also affect the quality of
    habitat in the sea, creating environmental challenges. When possible, coastal
    engineers look toward “softer” solutions to erosion. One of those techniques involves
    planting or maintaining trees and shrubs that can grow in the tidal zones along
    coasts. These are called mangrove forests, and their dense networks of roots absorb
    wave energy and protect the soil along the coast.

  zh: 这些硬质防护结构通常能为侵蚀提供长期解决方案，但也可能带来意想不到的后果。举个例子，光滑的混凝土海堤会反射波浪，而不是吸收波浪，这可能导致更远的海岸侵蚀加剧。这些结构也可能影响海洋中的栖息地质量，带来环境挑战。尽可能地，沿海工程师倾向于寻找“更软”的侵蚀解决方案。其中一种方法是种植或维持可以在潮汐带沿岸生长的树木和灌木。这些被称为红树林森林，它们密集的根系吸收波浪能量，保护沿海的土壤。
- en: Another soft solution to coastal erosion is to create artificial reefs that
    provide habitat for fish, corals, and other marine life. Many materials have been
    used to construct artificial reefs, including rocks, concrete, shipwrecks, and
    even submerged subway cars. These reefs offer surfaces where marine organisms
    can attach or hide, with a secondary benefit of dissipating wave energy offshore,
    serving as submerged breakwaters.

  zh: 另一个应对海岸侵蚀的软性解决方案是创建人工礁，为鱼类、珊瑚和其他海洋生物提供栖息地。许多材料已被用于构建人工礁，包括岩石、混凝土、沉船甚至是沉没的地铁车厢。这些礁石为海洋生物提供附着或躲藏的表面，同时还具有消散海浪能量的副作用，充当水下防波堤。
- en: Yet another soft solution is to reverse the process of erosion by replacing
    the material that has been lost, a technique commonly known as beach nourishment.
    Beaches are not only essential recreation areas and economic drivers, but they
    also serve as buffers between development and the sea. They dissipate the energy
    from storms and waves before it can reach developed areas, but sand can be moved
    downdrift or pulled out into deeper waters in the process. Replenishing lost sand
    protects coastal structures and creates spaces for recreation. Nourishment is
    often accomplished by borrowing sediments from the seafloor with a dredge and
    pumping them back to the shore as a *slurry* of water and sand in a pipeline.
    The slurry is discharged ashore into a large basin to allow the water to drain
    and sand to settle out, after which it can be spread along the beach using earth-moving
    equipment. Beach nourishment has environmental impacts, and it’s not a permanent
    solution, but it is a popular tool for addressing coastal erosion.

  zh: 另一种软性解决方案是通过补充失去的物质来逆转侵蚀过程，这种技术通常被称为沙滩营养。沙滩不仅是重要的休闲区域和经济驱动力，还是开发与大海之间的缓冲区。它们在风暴和波浪能量到达开发区域之前将其消散，但在过程中，沙子可能会被带走或冲入更深的水域。补充失去的沙子能够保护海岸结构并创造休闲空间。沙滩营养通常通过使用挖泥机从海底借取沉积物，并将其作为含水泥沙浆通过管道泵回海岸来实现。沙浆会排放到岸上一个大水池中，允许水分排出并使沙子沉淀下来，然后使用土方设备将其均匀铺开。这种沙滩营养方法具有环境影响，且并非永久解决方案，但它是应对海岸侵蚀的常用工具。
- en: 'Finally, sometimes the cheapest option to protect shoreline development from
    damage is for it not to exist in the first place. This strategy, often called
    *retreat*, involves purchasing and condemning property or relocating buildings
    and infrastructure farther from the shore. In some cases, the best engineering
    is to let nature do what it does best: allowing the coastline to be vibrant and
    dynamic, which is what draws humans to it in the first place.'

- en: A lock consists of a watertight chamber with large gates at either end. The
    way a lock works is quite simple. A ship going up enters the mostly empty chamber,
    and the lower gate is closed. Then water from above is allowed to fill the space,
    raising the vessel. Once the level in the lock reaches that of the upper canal,
    the upper gate can be fully opened, and the ship can continue on its way. Going
    down follows the same steps, but in reverse. A ship enters the filled chamber,
    the upper gate is closed, and the water in the lock is allowed to drain. Once
    the level in the chamber matches that of the lower canal, the lower gate can be
    fully opened, and the ship can continue onward. It’s an entirely reversible lift
    system that, in its simplest form, requires no external source of power to work,
    except for the water itself.

    ships can easily line up to enter the chamber. Small locks used for recreational

- en: The gates on each side of the lock chamber are engineering marvels themselves.
    Most locks use miter gates. They are composed of two leaves, like enormous, hinged
    doors that close toward the center. Instead of closing in a straight line, the
    leaves meet at an angle pointing upstream. Pressure from the water above forces
    the gates tightly closed, keeping them sealed and leak-free during the operation
    of the lock. In some places, particularly those affected by tides, it is possible
    for the downstream level to rise above that in the upper canal. In such a situation,
    miter gates would not function properly. Sector gates provide an alternative to
    miter gates that can handle water pressure from both directions. Sector gates
    are shaped like slices of pie that hinge at their points and meet in the center.
    Some modern locks employ gates that roll open and closed instead of using hinges.
    Rolling gates benefit from sliding into a recess that can be pumped dry for maintenance
    and repairs (rather than needing to remove each gate entirely).

  zh: 每个船闸室两侧的门本身就是工程奇迹。大多数船闸使用斜门，它们由两扇门叶组成，像巨大的铰链门一样，向中央关闭。门叶不是直线关闭，而是以指向上游的角度相遇。来自上方水流的压力迫使门紧紧关闭，确保它们在船闸操作过程中保持密封且无泄漏。在某些地方，特别是在受潮汐影响的区域，下游水位可能会高于上游水道的水位。在这种情况下，斜门无法正常工作。扇形门则可以作为斜门的替代品，能够承受来自两个方向的水压。扇形门的形状像切开的派块，在连接点上铰链相连，并在中间汇合。一些现代船闸使用滚动门代替铰链门，这些门通过滑动进出一个可以抽干水以进行维护和修理的凹槽（而不是需要完全移除每个门）。
- en: In all locks, the lower gate is the real workhorse. The upper gate must only
    be tall enough to allow ships to enter the chamber when filled. The lower gate
    must hold back water from the very top to the bottom of the chamber. Water pressure
    increases with depth, so locks with a significant rise require the lower gate
    to withstand extreme forces. When a canal needs to ascend a substantial elevation
    difference, multiple smaller locks in series (called a *flight*) are used rather
    than a single large lock.

- en: The plumbing required to fill and empty a lock chamber is another essential
    part of its engineering. Many locks are choke points to waterway traffic, so operators
    try to minimize the time it takes a ship to get through. Imagine the challenge
    of filling and draining a gigantic swimming pool 30 or more times per day while
    people are in the pool. Similarly, you can’t just open the upper gate and let
    the water flow in. For one, the difference in water levels creates so much pressure
    that opening the gate is practically impossible. More important, the in- or outrush
    of water would endanger ships transiting through the lock. Instead, most locks
    use a separate system to fill and drain the chamber. The simplest option is to
    have a smaller shutter, sometimes called a *paddle*, in each gate that can be
    opened and closed. Large locks use culverts to move water through ports in the
    sides or bottom of the chamber. Two valves control the flow. The lock is filled
    by opening the valve at the upper gate, and the chamber is drained by opening
    the one at the lower gate. The ports are carefully designed to move as much water
    as possible without creating dangerous turbulence, jets, or swells within the
    chamber that could capsize a ship.

  zh: 填充和排空船闸的水位系统是其工程设计中另一个至关重要的部分。许多船闸是水道交通的瓶颈，因此操作员尽力缩短船只通过的时间。试想，每天要填充和排空一个巨大的游泳池三十次或更多次，同时池中还有人。在船闸中也类似，你不能只是打开上闸门让水流进来。首先，水位差造成的压力让打开闸门几乎不可能。更重要的是，水的进出会危及通过船闸的船只。相反，大多数船闸使用一个单独的系统来填充和排空船闸。最简单的方式是在每个闸门中设置一个较小的闸板，有时被称为*桨*，它可以被打开或关闭。大型船闸则通过涵洞将水从船闸两侧或底部的出口处排出。两个阀门控制水流。上闸门的阀门打开时，船闸被填充，而下闸门的阀门打开时，船闸就会排空。设计这些出水口时特别注重避免产生危险的湍流、喷流或水浪，这些可能会使船只翻覆。
- en: Even with a well-designed filling system, a lock chamber can be a turbulent
    space. Ships need to be moored in place to avoid collisions with the gates or
    walls. However, mooring lines can’t be attached to the tops of the lock walls.
    For a ship moving up, they would immediately become slack. For a ship moving down,
    they could pull the vessel right out of the water! Smaller locks require the boat
    pilot to take in or pay out the lines as the water level rises or falls. Larger
    locks use floating bitts that ride along vertical guides to keep moored vessels
    in place as they ascend or descend.

    earthen embankments can deteriorate over time, maintenance is vital. Levees must
    be kept free of trees and woody vegetation that can be toppled or ripped out during

    alternative is to build a floodwall. These walls are typically made from reinforced

    a somewhat confusing term for a simple concept. Because we have extensive historical
    records of rainfall worldwide, we can estimate the relationship between any storm’s
    severity and its probability of occurring. The 100-year flood is a reference point
    on that line: a theoretical storm that has a 1 percent chance of being equaled
    or exceeded in a given year at a certain location. Although its name implies that
    it happens only once every hundred years, the 1 percent annual chance equates

    a way to allow drainage to pass through in one direction without allowing the
    river to backflow into protected areas during floods. Some large-scale systems
    use pumps to move local drainage out of low-lying areas, but pumps can be expensive.
    Pipes, called culverts, can pass through levees and floodwalls, or their foundations,
    to allow drainage of enclosed areas to occur by gravity. These culverts are equipped

    exacerbating flood impacts farther downstream. Even with excellent engineering,

    sometimes just wide enough to drive a vehicle over the top, giving them a characteristic
    slope on the downstream side. Similarly, buttress dams transfer the forces from

    of the water’s weight for stability as well. Buttress dams require less concrete

    impounded water into the abutments on each side of the dam instead of the foundation.
    Like arch bridges (described in Chapter 4), arch dams take advantage of geometry

    need less concrete and thus can be more economical to construct. However, they
    can be located only on sites with advantageous geology since the abutments need
    to resist most of the reservoir forces attempting to push the structure downstream.
    Thus, arch dams are most often found in narrow, rocky valleys. Some buttress dams

    cracking. Unlike random cracks that could form in a solid concrete structure,
    joints are easy to seal against leakage using embedded water stops and sealants.
    Although you can’t see them from the outside, many concrete dams have internal
    tunnels, called galleries, to collect any leaking water and allow engineers to
    monitor the structure’s integrity from the inside. Galleries also provide a location
    for drains that relieve pressure within a dam’s foundation.

    in a natural watercourse varies over time and can be quite shallow for long stretches.
    Low-head dams impound a small volume of water, artificially raising the level
    to make a channel more navigable by boats, increase the depth at intakes for water
    supply and irrigation, or create a drop for powering turbines or waterwheels.
    Low-head dams are often called *weirs* because water flows over the top (rather

    debris, and even people. With strong hydraulic forces, the hard surfaces of the
    dam, disorienting turbulence, and submerged debris, the low-head dam has been
    known as the perfect drowning machine. Many were constructed long ago when mills
    and factories relied on waterpower to drive equipment, and safety was low on the

- en: Embankment dams can be constructed out of soil, called *earthfill*, or out of
    stones or gravel, called *rockfill*. Both types of material behave much differently
    than concrete. Because they are granular substances composed of individual particles,
    earthfill and rockfill are naturally unstable. Gravity is always trying to pull
    them apart, and the only force holding an embankment together is the friction
    between individual grains or rocks. Large embankments that can stand tall over
    the long term and resist pressure from a reservoir must have gentle slopes on
    the upstream and downstream sides. The necessary slope depends on the properties
    of the material being used, but most earthfill dams have slopes with widths that
    are around three times their height. The slopes of rockfill structures can be
    steeper but rarely less than a two-to-one ratio of width to height. That means
    both earthfill and rockfill embankments have broad footprints that taper as their
    height decreases toward each end. Many also feature a toe berm, an area of additional
    fill along the bottom of one or both slopes to stabilize the structure further.

  zh: 堤坝可以由土壤建造，称为*土填料*，或由石块或砾石建造，称为*石填料*。这两种材料的行为与混凝土大不相同。由于它们是由单独颗粒组成的颗粒状物质，土填料和石填料自然不稳定。重力总是试图把它们分开，唯一把堤坝固定在一起的力量是颗粒或岩石之间的摩擦力。能够长期保持高大并承受水库压力的大型堤坝，必须在上游和下游两侧具有缓坡。所需的坡度取决于所使用材料的性质，但大多数土填料堤坝的坡度宽度大约是其高度的三倍。石填料结构的坡度可以更陡，但宽度与高度的比例通常不小于二比一。这意味着，土填料和石填料堤坝的底部宽阔，在两端逐渐变窄。许多堤坝还设有脚趾带，这是在一个或两个坡面底部额外填充的区域，以进一步稳定结构。
- en: Soil and rock can’t simply be dumped into place to create a dam. Granular materials
    settle and compress over time, and the height of the pile magnifies this effect.
    We don’t want dams shrinking after they’re built, so fill must be compacted and
    densified during placement to create a firm and stable structure. Compaction speeds
    up the settlement process, so it mostly happens during construction instead of
    afterward. If soil is compacted to its maximum density, that means it won’t settle
    further over time. Modern construction equipment can compact a layer of soil up
    to around 30 centimeters (1 foot) thick at a time. Rolling over thicker layers
    will only densify the surface, leaving the underlying ground loose. So, embankments
    are constructed slowly from the bottom up in individual layers called lifts.

  zh: 土壤和岩石不能简单地堆放起来建造堤坝。颗粒状材料会随着时间的推移沉降和压实，堆积物的高度会放大这种效应。我们不希望堤坝在建造后发生缩小现象，因此必须在填料放置过程中进行压实和加密，以创建一个坚固稳定的结构。压实加速了沉降过程，因此大部分是在施工过程中完成的，而不是施工后。如果土壤被压实到其最大密度，这意味着它以后不会再沉降。现代施工设备可以一次将土壤压实约30厘米（1英尺）厚。压实更厚的层次只会使表面密实，而下面的土层仍然松散。因此，堤坝是从底部开始，逐层（称为提升层）缓慢构建的。
- en: Rockfill and most types of earthfill are permeable materials that can allow
    water to flow right through (a phenomenon called *seepage*). Unlike concrete dams,
    which accomplish both stability and water tightness with one material, embankment
    dams often require additional features to hold a reservoir back. Most earthfill
    dams have different zones of material. The core is constructed using clay soils
    that are highly impermeable to seepage. Depending on the site’s geology, finding
    clay in sufficient volume that meets strict specifications for water tightness
    can be a challenge. The core is typically the costliest part of an embankment
    project, so its dimensions are engineered to be only as large as necessary. The
    outer shells have less stringent specifications because they provide only stability
    and don’t need to be so watertight.

- en: Rockfill dams, being much more porous than earthfill structures, usually include
    a barrier of concrete, asphalt, or clay in the core or along the upstream slope
    to make the embankment impervious to seepage. In addition, although not visible
    from the outside, many embankment dams feature some kind of cutoff wall into the

    can create erosion and deterioration. Therefore, nearly all large earthfill dams
    will have some kind of armoring on the upstream face to protect against long-term
    damage from waves. Often this armoring consists of a thick layer of rocks called
    riprap. A layer of smaller gravel called bedding sits between the dam and larger
    rocks to prevent soil from washing out from under the riprap. Alternatively, many
    dams use a mixture of onsite soil and cement, forming an inexpensive but durable
    armoring called soil-cement. It is often placed in lifts along the upstream face

    hoist above the gate lifts the structure via chains or wire ropes to allow water
    to flow underneath. Crest gates pivot at their bottom and are often operated using
    hydraulic cylinders. Some gates even rely on large rubber bladders that can be

    a flip bucket at the end of the chute to launch the flow into the air where it

    basin to protect the dam’s foundation from erosion. Stilling basins rely on a
    phenomenon called a hydraulic jump that occurs when fast-flowing water transitions
    into a slower stream. Most stilling basins use different combinations of baffle
    blocks to force a hydraulic jump to form. The turbulent jump stays within the

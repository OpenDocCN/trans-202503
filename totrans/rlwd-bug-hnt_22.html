<h2 class="h2" id="app02"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_217"/><strong><span class="big">B</span><br/>RESOURCES</strong></h2>&#13;
<div class="image1"><img alt="Image" src="../images/common.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This appendix contains a list of resources you can use to expand your skill set. The links to these resources and others are also available at <em><a href="https://www.torontowebsitedeveloper.com/hacking-resources/">https://www.torontowebsitedeveloper.com/hacking-resources/</a></em> and the book’s web page at <em><a href="https://nostarch.com/bughunting/">https://nostarch.com/bughunting/</a></em>.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="app02lev1sec1"><strong>Online Training</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In this book, I show you how vulnerabilities work using real bug reports. Although after reading the book, you should have a practical understanding of how to find vulnerabilities, you should never stop learning. You can access many online bug-hunting tutorials, formal courses, practice exercises, and blogs to continue expanding your knowledge and putting your skills to the test.</p>&#13;
<p class="listhead"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_218"/><strong>Coursera</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="listbody">Coursera is similar to Udacity but partners with post secondary institutions to provide university-level courses rather than working with companies and industry professionals. Coursera offers a Cybersecurity Specialization (<em><a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cyber-security/">https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cyber-security/</a></em>) that includes five courses. I haven’t taken the specialization course but found the Course 2: Software Security videos very informative.</p>&#13;
<p class="listhead"><strong>The Exploit Database</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="listbody">Although not a traditional online training course, the Exploit Database (<em><a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/">https://www.exploit-db.com/</a></em>) documents vulnerabilities and often links them to common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) when possible. Using the code snippets in the database without understanding them can be dangerous and destructive, so make sure you take a close look at each before attempting to use them.</p>&#13;
<p class="listhead"><strong>Google Gruyere</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="listbody">Google Gruyere (<em><a href="https://google-gruyere.appspot.com/">https://google-gruyere.appspot.com/</a></em>) is a vulnerable web application with tutorials and explanations for you to work through. You can practice finding common vulnerabilities, such as XSS, privilege escalation, CSRF, path traversal, and other bugs.</p>&#13;

<p class="listhead"><strong>PentesterLab</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="listbody">PentesterLab (<em><a href="https://pentesterlab.com/">https://pentesterlab.com/</a></em>) provides vulnerable systems that you can use to test and understand vulnerabilities. Exercises are based on common vulnerabilities found in different systems. Instead of made-up issues, the site provides real systems with real vulnerabilities. Some lessons are available for free, and others require a Pro membership. The membership is well worth the investment.</p>&#13;
<p class="listhead"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_219"/><strong>Udacity</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="listbody">Udacity hosts free online courses in a variety of subjects, including web development and programming.

<h3 class="h3" id="app02lev1sec2"><strong>Bug Bounty Platforms</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Although all web applications run the risk of containing bugs, it hasn’t always been possible to easily report vulnerabilities. Currently, there are many bug bounty platforms to choose from that connect hackers to companies that need vulnerability testing.</p>&#13;
<p class="listhead"><strong>Bounty Factory</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="listbody">Bounty Factory (<em><a href="https://bountyfactory.io/">https://bountyfactory.io/</a></em>) is a European bug bounty platform that follows European rules and legislation. It’s newer than HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Synack, and Cobalt.</p>&#13;

The platform connects hackers who want to responsibly disclose bugs to companies who want to receive them. The HackerOne platform includes nonpaying vulnerability disclosure programs and paying bug bounty programs. Programs on HackerOne can be private, by invitation only, or public. As of this writing, HackerOne is the only platform that allows hackers to publicly disclose bugs on on their platform, as long as the program that resolves the bug consents.</p>&#13;

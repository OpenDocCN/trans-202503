<div class="image1"><img src="Images/common.jpg" alt="Image" width="189" height="189"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Albert Einstein was fascinated with the electromagnetic theory that we’ll discuss in <a href="part03.xhtml">Part III</a> of this book. An effort to understand it led him to new ideas about space and time, collectively called <em>special relativity</em>, which he published in 1905, and which modified the ideas of Newtonian mechanics that had been in place for more than 200 years.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Special relativity departs from Newtonian physics in several ways, the most significant conceptual departure being the non-universality of time—that is, the idea that clocks in different patterns of motion evolve at different rates. The subject of special relativity deserves an entire course for one to develop insight and intuition into relativistic kinematics and dynamics, but here we’ll only scratch the surface.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In this chapter, we’ll go beyond Newtonian mechanics to show how the theory of special relativity makes different predictions for the motion of a particle, especially when the particle is moving very fast. The framework of <a href="ch16.xhtml#ch16fig2">Figure 16-2</a>, in which we transform from forces to a differential equation to a state-update function and finally to a list of states, still works well. It’s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_330"/>just that Newton’s second law needs to be replaced with a relativistic law of motion to compute special relativity’s prediction for the motion of a particle experiencing forces. The relativistic law will transform the forces into a differential equation different from the one that Newton’s second law produces. The remaining steps of solving the differential equation are the same in relativity as they are in Newtonian mechanics. At the end of the chapter, we’ll show some examples where Newtonian mechanics and relativity make different predictions. Let’s begin by getting specific about how special relativity departs from Newtonian mechanics.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch18lev1">A Little Theory</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In special relativity, the net force acting on a particle is still the vector sum of all of the forces acting on the particle.</p>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><img src="Images/e0330-01.jpg" alt="Image" width="300" height="50"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">There are no new forces in relativity. The theory of special relativity claims that net force is close to, but not quite equal to, mass times acceleration, as Newton’s second law says. The difference is more noticeable as objects move faster and closer to the speed of light. However, there is a version of Newton’s second law that continues to hold in relativity. Net force is still the rate of change of momentum with respect to time. Equation 16.1 needs to be replaced by</p>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><img src="Images/e0330-02.jpg" alt="Image" width="198" height="44"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">where <strong>p</strong>(<em>t</em>) is the momentum of the object under consideration.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The relationship between velocity and momentum is different in special relativity than in Newtonian mechanics. In Newtonian mechanics, the momentum of a particle is its mass times its velocity, <strong>p</strong>(<em>t</em>) = <em>m</em><strong>v</strong>(<em>t</em>). In relativistic physics, the momentum of a particle is</p>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><img src="Images/e0330-03.jpg" alt="Image" width="176" height="65"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">where <em>c</em> = 299,792,458 m/s, the speed of light in vacuum. We can algebraically invert this equation to give an expression for velocity in terms of momentum.</p>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><img src="Images/e0330-04.jpg" alt="Image" width="193" height="66"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Acceleration is still the rate of change of velocity with respect to time, so by taking a time derivative of the previous equation and substituting net force for the time derivative of momentum, we arrive at a relativistic expression for acceleration in terms of net force.</p>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><img src="Images/e0330-05.jpg" alt="Image" width="697" height="54"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_331"/>Equation 18.1 is the relativistic replacement for Equation 16.5. You can see that if the ratio of particle velocity to light velocity is much smaller than 1, the right side of this equation reduces to net force divided by mass, and we regain the original form of Newton’s second law. This means that for something like a baseball traveling through the air, Newton’s second law is basically sound. But if it were hit close to the speed of light, we’d need relativity.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If Equation 18.1 seems too complicated and ugly to be correct, you should know that special relativity has its own notation that makes equations like Equation 18.1 appear much nicer. Relativity’s notation uses 4-vectors because spacetime has four dimensions. The vectors of Newtonian mechanics we are using in this book are called 3-vectors because space has three dimensions. From the perspective of relativity, 3-vectors are based on an arbitrary division of space-time into a particular three-dimensional space and a particular one-dimensional time. Some quantities that we think of as distinct, like momentum and energy, come together in relativity to form the 4-vector that Taylor and Wheeler call <em>momenergy</em>.<sup><a id="ch18fn1a" href="footnote.xhtml#ch18fn1">1</a></sup> It’s only when we cast the newer ideas of relativity in the older notation of Newtonian mechanics that they appear so complicated. Nevertheless, although there is a different notation that can be used for special relativity, it gives the same results as the notation we use in this book.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch18lev2">A Replacement for Newton’s Second Law</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In <a href="ch16.xhtml">Chapters 16</a> and <a href="ch17.xhtml">17</a>, we used the function <span class="literal">newtonSecondPS</span> to produce a differential equation that expresses Newton’s second law. The function <span class="literal">relativityPS</span>, which we’ll write next, produces the differential equation that special relativistic dynamics prescribes, and therefore it serves as a replacement for <span class="literal">newtonSecondPS</span>. Fortunately, we can use the same data type for particle state, namely <span class="literal">ParticleState</span>, that we have been using throughout the previous chapters.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The key difference between <span class="literal">newtonSecondPS</span> and <span class="literal">relativityPS</span> is in the expression we return for acceleration. We want to use Equation 18.1 instead of net force divided by mass. The function <span class="literal">relativityPS</span> assumes SI units, so velocity is expressed in meters per second. Relativity is more elegantly expressed in natural, or geometrized, units in which <em>c</em> = 1, implying that one second is interchangeable with 299,792,458 meters. Exercise 18.2 asks you to write a similar function that does not assume SI units.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Here is <span class="literal">relativityPS</span>, which we include in the <span class="literal">Mechanics3D</span> module that includes all of the code in <a href="ch16.xhtml">Chapters 16</a>, <a href="ch17.xhtml">17</a>, and <a href="ch18.xhtml">18</a> that is not part of a stand-alone program.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">The <span class="literal">let</span> clause introduces local variables for the net force, the speed of light, the mass and velocity contained in the state, the velocity <span class="literal">u</span> expressed in units of the speed of light, and the acceleration determined by Equation 18.1. The time derivative of the state is then prepared and returned in the body of the <span class="literal">let</span> construction.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Let’s now look at the first of two examples comparing Newtonian mechanics to special relativity theory.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch18lev3">Response to a Constant Force</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Let’s contrast the predictions of special relativity with those of Newtonian mechanics. The first situation we’ll explore is the motion of a particle, initially at rest, that experiences a constant force for some extended time period.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a href="ch18.xhtml#ch18fig1">Figure 18-1</a> shows a graph of velocity as a function of time for a 1-kg object experiencing a 10-N force. This is close to the gravitational force acting on a 1-kg object at the surface of the earth (a 1-<em>g</em> acceleration).</p>&#13;

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 18-1: Comparison of Newtonian and relativistic response to a constant force. A mass of 1 kg experiences a constant force of 10 N.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_333"/>For the first few months, there is little difference in velocity between the relativistic prediction and that of Newtonian mechanics. However, as the velocity gets closer to that of light, we do see a difference, with the relativistic curve predicting a velocity asymptotically approaching, but never reaching, that of light, while the Newtonian velocity increases linearly and eventually exceeds that of light. As there is very strong experimental evidence that objects with mass cannot travel faster than light, the Newtonian prediction is clearly incorrect.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">Several local variables are defined in the beginning of the code, such as the number of seconds in a year, the speed of light in meters per second, a numerical method, an initial state, and so on. The first five local variables are used in both the Newtonian and relativistic calculations. The lists <span class="literal">newtonStates</span> and <span class="literal">relativityStates</span> are infinite lists of states for the Newtonian and relativistic theories, respectively. In comparing their definitions, we see that they use the same numerical method, the same forces (a single 10-N force in the x-direction), and the same initial state. The only difference is that we replaced <span class="literal">newtonSecondPS</span> with <span class="literal">relativityPS</span> as the function that produces the differential equation we’re solving.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Finally, the lists <span class="literal">newtonTVs</span> and <span class="literal">relativityTVs</span> are lists of time-velocity pairs suitable for plotting.

<h3 class="h3" id="ch18lev4">Proton in a Magnetic Field</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">As a second example contrasting the predictions of special relativity with those of Newtonian mechanics, let’s look at the motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field. While our first example of special relativity took place in one spatial dimension, this example takes place in two. <a href="ch18.xhtml#ch18fig2">Figure 18-2</a> shows trajectories of a proton in a 1-Tesla magnetic field pointing in the z-direction (perpendicular to the plane of the circular trajectories).</p>&#13;

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 18-2: Proton in a magnetic field</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The proton has a speed 4/5 that of light. Both the Newtonian theory and the relativistic theory predict circular motion, but the radii of the circles are different. We see from the graphs that relativity predicts a larger radius compared with the Newtonian theory. The relativistic radius turns out to be bigger by a factor of <img class="inline" src="Images/e0334-01.jpg" alt="Image" width="122" height="25"/>, a factor that shows up in many places in relativity. In this case, the relativistic radius is 5/3 times that of the Newtonian radius.</p>&#13;

<p class="listing"><em>Listing 18-2: Code to produce the graph “Proton in a 1-T magnetic field”</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The first four local variables, which are used in the predictions of both theories, define the speed of light, a numerical method, a list of forces, and an initial state.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">How can we choose an appropriate time step for the numerical method? Guessing can work, but a time step that is much too large usually gives unintelligible results, and a time step that is much too small may result in very little motion, or a calculation that takes a very long time, depending on what you ask of the computer. The key is that we want the time step to be small compared with the important time scales of the situation. The important time scales of a situation can be found from dimensional analysis. Using dimensional analysis, multiplying or dividing relevant parameters to produce a quantity with dimensions of time, we can find one or more characteristic time scales. The relevant parameters in this situation are the proton charge, the proton mass, the 1-T magnetic field, and the initial velocity of 4<em>c</em>/5.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The only way to form a quantity with dimensions of time from these parameters is to divide the proton mass by the product of the proton charge with the magnetic field. This combination of parameters produces a time of <em>m<sub>p</sub></em>/(<em>q<sub>p</sub> B</em>) = 1.04 × 10<sup>–8</sup> s. To make the time step small compared with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_336"/>the relevant time scale of the problem, we should divide this time by 100 or 1,000. Therefore, a time step of 10<sup>–10</sup> s would be a good first guess.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The lists <span class="literal">newtonStates</span> and <span class="literal">relativityStates</span> are, as in the constant force example from earlier, infinite lists of states for the Newtonian and relativistic cases, respectively. The lists <span class="literal">newtonXYs</span> and <span class="literal">relativityXYs</span> are lists of (x, y) pairs suitable for plotting. Since we end up with circular motion, it’s aesthetically pleasing to use the same scale for the x-axis that we use for the y-axis. This can be achieved with the <span class="literal">Aspect (Ratio 1)</span> option in the list of options.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The speeds in the relativistic and Newtonian calculations are the same, but since the relativistic circle is bigger, the period of the proton’s motion (the time to go around the circle once) is larger in the relativistic theory. However, this fact is not apparent in the graph. Because of this, and also to show a technique for animating two separate motions, we’ll make an animation for these protons.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Since the motion takes place in two dimensions, we’ll use <span class="literal">gloss</span> for the animation. What we’re animating here is not the interaction between two protons, which would be one physical problem consisting of multiple particles, and the kind of thing we’ll discuss in the next chapter. Rather, we’re interested in an animation that shows the independent motion of the two protons at the same time. Up to now, the state space for every animation we have written has been the same as the state space for the underlying physical situation. For a single particle in three dimensions, that state space is <span class="literal">ParticleState</span>. Now we want to animate two particles, each of which uses the state space <span class="literal">ParticleState</span>. This means that the state space for the animation needs to be <span class="literal">(ParticleState,ParticleState)</span> so the animation can keep track of both particles.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="h3" id="ch18lev5">Summary</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, we introduced special relativity as a different, more modern theory of mechanics, which our methods are capable of treating if we replace Newton’s second law with the appropriate relativistic recipe for creating a differential equation from a list of forces. Solving a mechanics problem using relativity is still a process of transforming information through a sequence of four representations, starting with one-body forces, then a differential equation, then a state-update function, and finally a list of states. The relativity law, Equation 18.1, appears in this process as the means to transform a list of forces acting on an object into a differential equation. A numerical method still transforms a differential equation into a state-update function, and we still use iteration to produce a list of states as the solution to a mechanics problem. We were able to use the same <span class="literal">ParticleState</span> data type that we used for Newtonian mechanics. We developed ideas and tools <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_338"/>to solve any single-particle mechanics problem using the laws of special relativity. This is the last chapter to focus on a single particle. In the next chapter, we’ll discuss multiple interacting particles.</p>&#13;

<p class="noindentts"><strong>Exercise 18.1.</strong> What time step is being used in the calculations of <a href="ch18.xhtml#ch18fig1">Figure 18-1</a>?</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Exercise 18.2.</strong> The function <span class="literal">relativityPS</span> we wrote to do the dynamics for relativity assumed that velocities would be given in SI units. However, this may not always be convenient. We may want to use natural units instead, in which <em>c</em> = 1. Let’s write a function that takes a value of <em>c</em> as input, there-by allowing us to use SI units, natural units, or whatever other units we might want.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Use Equation 18.1 to write the function.</p>&#13;
<pre>relativityPS' :: R  -- c&#13;
              -&gt; [OneBodyForce]&#13;
              -&gt; ParticleState -&gt; DParticleState&#13;
relativityPS' c fs st = undefined c fs st</pre>&#13;
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Exercise 18.3.</strong> Explore the relativistic harmonic oscillator by comparing it to a Newtonian harmonic oscillator. The only force is a linear restoring force chosen with a spring constant that will give a Newtonian period of 1 second. Use a mass of 1 kg, an initial position of 0, and an initial velocity of 4/5<em>c</em> in whatever direction you like. (The motion will be one dimensional.) Use one of the examples in this chapter as a template for your code. Plot velocity versus time for the Newtonian result and the relativistic result. Your results should look something like <a href="ch18.xhtml#ch18fig3">Figure 18-3</a>.</p>&#13;

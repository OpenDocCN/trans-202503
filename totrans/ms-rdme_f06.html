			<p class="BodyFirst"><span class="DropCap">Y</span>ou come into your new job ready to solve hard problems, to write elegant code, and to ply your craft. Exciting! Congratulations! We hope you get to tackle interesting challenges; work with wonderful, intelligent, and passionate colleagues; and build useful things.</p>
			<p>
				But you will soon discover, or perhaps have already discovered, that knowing how to program—how to use computers to solve problems—is only half the battle. It’s a critical part of your skillset, yet to be an effective software engineer, you need other skills that are not taught in school. <em>The Missing README</em> will teach you these skills.</p>
			<p>We will explain modern practices for building, testing, and running production software, and describe behaviors and approaches that make for stronger teams and better teammates. We’ll give you practical advice on how to get help, write design documents, work on old code, be on-call, plan your work, and interact with your manager and team.</p>
			<p>
				This book doesn’t contain everything you’ll need to know—an impossible task that would make for an exhausting read. Instead, we focus on the most important information not usually covered in undergraduate computer science curricula. These topics are deep, so we end each <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxii" title="xxii"/>chapter with a “Level Up” section containing recommended reading if you want more information.</p>
			<p>The first few chapters explain what to expect when you begin your career at a company. The middle group expands your technical education: writing production-quality code, effective testing, code reviews, continuous integration and deployment, design documents, and architectural best practices. The final three chapters cover softer skills, such as Agile planning, working with your manager, and career advice.</p>
			<p>This is an opinionated book influenced by our experiences building teams in rapidly growing, VC-funded, pre-IPO Silicon Valley companies. Your setting might be different, and that’s fine. Specifics differ from company to company, but the fundamentals are universal.</p>
			<p><em>The Missing README</em> is the book we wish we had when we started out—the book we plan to give to new engineers we welcome to our teams. By the end, you’ll know what it takes to be a professional software engineer. Let’s get started!</p>

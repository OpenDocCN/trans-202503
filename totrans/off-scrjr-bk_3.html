<span class="blue">CHAPTER 2</span>
<br />
ANIMATIONS</strong>
</h2>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="noindent">Let’s get more familiar with ScratchJr by creating some simple animations. To get your characters moving, you just need to give them scripts that describe how you want them to move.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ll do four small activities together, and then we’ll make a final animation at the end of the chapter!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec14"><a id="page_28"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 2: MAKE YOUR CAT MOVE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Can you get the ScratchJr cat to move from one side of the screen to the other? Figure out how many Move Right blocks you need!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec16">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will explore some options for making the cat move on the screen. All motion in ScratchJr follows a grid, and you’ll discover how to change the number of steps along this grid using the motion blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll also learn how to use the Start on Green Flag block to reset your cat’s position so that you can run your script again and again.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec17"><a id="page_29"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can make a very simple script with lots of Move Right blocks, and the cat will take one step to the right for each block. But isn’t it a lot of work to drag and connect all these motion blocks together?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">There must be a better way to do this. . . .</p>
<p class="indent">Aha! There is a number at the bottom of each motion block. Let’s see what happens when you change it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">When you tap the number at the bottom of the motion block, a keypad appears on the right side of the programming area. Enter a new number with the keypad, and then tap the block. Notice how far the cat moves with just one programming block.</p>
<p class="indentb">Let’s explore the meaning of this number a little more.</p>
<p class="order">1. Tap the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button at the top of the screen to show the grid.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_30"></a>
 You will see a grid appear on the stage. This grid will help you keep track of where your characters are on the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now tap your script again. See what happens when the cat moves from one spot to another on the stage? The blue square will move with your cat, and the blue numbered circles will indicate the cat’s new position on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Try to make your cat visit every corner of the stage by using the first four motion blocks in the blue blocks palette.</p>
<p class="order">4. If you start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block and you run the script by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, the cat will reset itself to its starting position before the script runs.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_31"></a>
 This will make it easier for you to make changes in your script and retest it, since the cat will always start from the same location. You can change the cat’s starting position by dragging the cat to another location on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">5. When you are finished having the cat visit all four corners of the stage, save your project by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button (). You’ll return to the home screen, where you can access all of your projects and make new ones.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec18">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There is no block for diagonal movement in ScratchJr. If you want to move the cat to a corner of the screen, you will have to move it to that spot with motion blocks for horizontal steps and vertical steps.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec19">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you have multiple motion blocks of the same kind in a row, see if you can simplify your script by changing the number input.</p>
<p class="indent">Experiment with the Hop block and see what happens when you change the number input.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Notice that changing the number input to 4 will not have the same effect as putting two Hop blocks next to each other.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">This is because the number input on a Hop block controls how high a character will hop, not how many times a character will hop.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_32"><a id="page_32" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb01">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: SPELLING A NAME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you’ve programmed your cat to move, come up with a name for the cat! Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to go to the paint editor, and replace the word <em>Cat</em>
 at the top with your cat’s name. Think about how each letter sounds as you try to spell it.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb02">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: SEEING HOW MANY WAYS YOU CAN GET TO 10</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">See if you can calculate which number on the grid the cat will end up on after you run your script. How many different scripts can you create that will make the cat move to that particular location?</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: there are many different ways to write a script and get to 10! Play around with changing the number inputs for the motion blocks to see what happens.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb03">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Children may have trouble understanding that one motion block can be used to make a character move several steps. Try setting up these two scripts to show how they make a character move the same distance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec15"><a id="page_33"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 3: MAKE YOUR CAT TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Next, you’ll make your cat turn right (clockwise) or left (counterclockwise).</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec20">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll create another new project and learn how to use the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks to tilt your cat clockwise or counterclockwise. See how many times your cat has to turn right or left to make a full circle. Then try thinking of other ways you could use these blocks!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec21"><a id="page_34"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. From the home screen, tap the plus sign to make a new project.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block from the blue blocks palette to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_35"></a>
 3. Change the number input, and tap the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block to see how the cat responds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Experiment to figure out what number will make the cat turn upside down. Then figure out what the number should be to make the cat turn a full circle.</p>
<p class="order">4. Don’t forget to start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block so that the cat returns to a vertical position before turning.</p>
<p class="order">5. Now try the same thing with the <strong>Turn Left</strong>
 block!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec22">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Notice that you can drag the cat around on the screen with your finger, and this will reset the cat’s starting position. You can’t rotate the cat with your finger, though! You have to use a motion block to do that.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec23">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See whether you can make the cat do a cartwheel by making it turn and move forward <em>at the same time</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: use two scripts for this and start both scripts at the same time with a Start on Green Flag block. You can also use this trick with Move Right and Move Up blocks to make the cat move diagonally!</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_36"><a id="page_36" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb04">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: DESCRIBING FEELINGS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of a story about why your cat is spinning. Is the cat happy? Sad? Dizzy? Explain your project to a friend, and make sure they understand why your cat is feeling that way.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb05">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TELLING TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of how a clock’s hands move around its face, and compare that direction to the direction of the cat when it turns. Which one of the turn blocks—Turn Left or Turn Right—moves the cat in the same direction as a clock’s hands?</p>
<p class="indent">See how many times the cat has to turn to go a quarter of the way around a circle. If you double the number input, will the cat turn halfway around the circle?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb06">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can think of the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks in terms of a clock face. Each turn moves the cat “one hour”—that is, one-twelfth of the full circle.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec16"><a id="page_37"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 4: LET’S PLAY HIDE-AND-SEEK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">The cat in this activity is playing a game of hide-and-seek. The cat will disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec24">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 , you used a purple block to make a character say something. In this activity, you will learn how to use the purple Hide and Show blocks to make the cat disappear and reappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, but don’t snap them together yet. Tap the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to see what happens. Now tap the <strong>Show</strong>
 block. These blocks make a character disappear and reappear.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_38"></a>
 3. Now drag two more sets of <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, and snap them onto the first set to make a script that causes the cat to disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the script to see how your cat plays hide-and-seek.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec26">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you combine motion blocks with the Hide and Show blocks, you will see that your cat can still move even when it’s hidden!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec27">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to make your cat disappear and then reappear at another place on the screen. Can you make your cat disappear and then reappear twice, each time moving to a new place on the screen? How about three times?</p>
<p class="indent">Try out other purple looks blocks, such as Grow and Shrink, to see how they change your cat’s appearance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">How large can you make the cat? How small can you make it? Notice what happens when you change the number input on these blocks. See if you can get the cat back to its original size. See whether the Start on Green Flag block has any effect on the cat’s size.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_39"><a id="page_39" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb07">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Why does your cat keep disappearing? Think of a story about why your cat is disappearing and reappearing, and share this story with a friend. Remember to speak clearly and explain what is happening in your scripts to help you tell the story!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb08">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: OBSERVING AND COUNTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of times your cat disappears and how many times it reappears. Does this match the number of blocks you used?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb09">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is helpful to have a conversation about what happens when you place a programming block after the Hide block. Sometimes children have trouble understanding why they cannot see their character complete a script after it has disappeared.</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that a Start on Green Flag block will reset a character’s position, but it will not make a hidden character visible.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec17"><a id="page_40"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_43"><a id="page_43" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb10">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb14">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: BUILDING NEW VOCABULARY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>
 —that is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and then improving the program.</p>
</div>

</html>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="noindent">Let’s get more familiar with ScratchJr by creating some simple animations. To get your characters moving, you just need to give them scripts that describe how you want them to move.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ll do four small activities together, and then we’ll make a final animation at the end of the chapter!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec14"><a id="page_28"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 2: MAKE YOUR CAT MOVE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Can you get the ScratchJr cat to move from one side of the screen to the other? Figure out how many Move Right blocks you need!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec16">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will explore some options for making the cat move on the screen. All motion in ScratchJr follows a grid, and you’ll discover how to change the number of steps along this grid using the motion blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll also learn how to use the Start on Green Flag block to reset your cat’s position so that you can run your script again and again.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec17"><a id="page_29"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can make a very simple script with lots of Move Right blocks, and the cat will take one step to the right for each block. But isn’t it a lot of work to drag and connect all these motion blocks together?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">There must be a better way to do this. . . .</p>
<p class="indent">Aha! There is a number at the bottom of each motion block. Let’s see what happens when you change it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">When you tap the number at the bottom of the motion block, a keypad appears on the right side of the programming area. Enter a new number with the keypad, and then tap the block. Notice how far the cat moves with just one programming block.</p>
<p class="indentb">Let’s explore the meaning of this number a little more.</p>
<p class="order">1. Tap the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button at the top of the screen to show the grid.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_30"></a>
 You will see a grid appear on the stage. This grid will help you keep track of where your characters are on the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now tap your script again. See what happens when the cat moves from one spot to another on the stage? The blue square will move with your cat, and the blue numbered circles will indicate the cat’s new position on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Try to make your cat visit every corner of the stage by using the first four motion blocks in the blue blocks palette.</p>
<p class="order">4. If you start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block and you run the script by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, the cat will reset itself to its starting position before the script runs.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_31"></a>
 This will make it easier for you to make changes in your script and retest it, since the cat will always start from the same location. You can change the cat’s starting position by dragging the cat to another location on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">5. When you are finished having the cat visit all four corners of the stage, save your project by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button (). You’ll return to the home screen, where you can access all of your projects and make new ones.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec18">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There is no block for diagonal movement in ScratchJr. If you want to move the cat to a corner of the screen, you will have to move it to that spot with motion blocks for horizontal steps and vertical steps.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec19">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you have multiple motion blocks of the same kind in a row, see if you can simplify your script by changing the number input.</p>
<p class="indent">Experiment with the Hop block and see what happens when you change the number input.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Notice that changing the number input to 4 will not have the same effect as putting two Hop blocks next to each other.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">This is because the number input on a Hop block controls how high a character will hop, not how many times a character will hop.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: SPELLING A NAME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you’ve programmed your cat to move, come up with a name for the cat! Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to go to the paint editor, and replace the word <em>Cat</em>
 at the top with your cat’s name. Think about how each letter sounds as you try to spell it.</p>

<p class="noindent">See if you can calculate which number on the grid the cat will end up on after you run your script. How many different scripts can you create that will make the cat move to that particular location?</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: there are many different ways to write a script and get to 10! Play around with changing the number inputs for the motion blocks to see what happens.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb03">

 <strong>ACTIVITY 3: MAKE YOUR CAT TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Next, you’ll make your cat turn right (clockwise) or left (counterclockwise).</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec20">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll create another new project and learn how to use the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks to tilt your cat clockwise or counterclockwise. See how many times your cat has to turn right or left to make a full circle. Then try thinking of other ways you could use these blocks!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec21"><a id="page_34"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. From the home screen, tap the plus sign to make a new project.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block from the blue blocks palette to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_35"></a>
 3. Change the number input, and tap the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block to see how the cat responds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Experiment to figure out what number will make the cat turn upside down. Then figure out what the number should be to make the cat turn a full circle.</p>
<p class="order">4. Don’t forget to start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block so that the cat returns to a vertical position before turning.</p>
<p class="order">5. Now try the same thing with the <strong>Turn Left</strong>
 block!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec22">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Notice that you can drag the cat around on the screen with your finger, and this will reset the cat’s starting position. You can’t rotate the cat with your finger, though! You have to use a motion block to do that.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec23">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb05">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TELLING TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of how a clock’s hands move around its face, and compare that direction to the direction of the cat when it turns. Which one of the turn blocks—Turn Left or Turn Right—moves the cat in the same direction as a clock’s hands?</p>
<p class="indent">See how many times the cat has to turn to go a quarter of the way around a circle. If you double the number input, will the cat turn halfway around the circle?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb06">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 4: LET’S PLAY HIDE-AND-SEEK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">The cat in this activity is playing a game of hide-and-seek. The cat will disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec24">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 , you used a purple block to make a character say something. In this activity, you will learn how to use the purple Hide and Show blocks to make the cat disappear and reappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, but don’t snap them together yet. Tap the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to see what happens. Now tap the <strong>Show</strong>
 block. These blocks make a character disappear and reappear.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_38"></a>
 3. Now drag two more sets of <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, and snap them onto the first set to make a script that causes the cat to disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the script to see how your cat plays hide-and-seek.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec26">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you combine motion blocks with the Hide and Show blocks, you will see that your cat can still move even when it’s hidden!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec27">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to make your cat disappear and then reappear at another place on the screen. Can you make your cat disappear and then reappear twice, each time moving to a new place on the screen? How about three times?</p>
<p class="indent">Try out other purple looks blocks, such as Grow and Shrink, to see how they change your cat’s appearance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">How large can you make the cat? How small can you make it? Notice what happens when you change the number input on these blocks. See if you can get the cat back to its original size. See whether the Start on Green Flag block has any effect on the cat’s size.</p>

<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_39"><a id="page_39" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb07">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Why does your cat keep disappearing? Think of a story about why your cat is disappearing and reappearing, and share this story with a friend. Remember to speak clearly and explain what is happening in your scripts to help you tell the story!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb08">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: OBSERVING AND COUNTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of times your cat disappears and how many times it reappears. Does this match the number of blocks you used?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb09">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is helpful to have a conversation about what happens when you place a programming block after the Hide block. Sometimes children have trouble understanding why they cannot see their character complete a script after it has disappeared.</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that a Start on Green Flag block will reset a character’s position, but it will not make a hidden character visible.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec17"><a id="page_40"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb10">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: BUILDING NEW VOCABULARY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>
 —that is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and then improving the program.</p>

<p class="indent">We’ll do four small activities together, and then we’ll make a final animation at the end of the chapter!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec14"><a id="page_28"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 2: MAKE YOUR CAT MOVE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Can you get the ScratchJr cat to move from one side of the screen to the other? Figure out how many Move Right blocks you need!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec16">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will explore some options for making the cat move on the screen. All motion in ScratchJr follows a grid, and you’ll discover how to change the number of steps along this grid using the motion blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll also learn how to use the Start on Green Flag block to reset your cat’s position so that you can run your script again and again.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec17"><a id="page_29"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can make a very simple script with lots of Move Right blocks, and the cat will take one step to the right for each block. But isn’t it a lot of work to drag and connect all these motion blocks together?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">There must be a better way to do this. . . .</p>
<p class="indent">Aha! There is a number at the bottom of each motion block. Let’s see what happens when you change it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">When you tap the number at the bottom of the motion block, a keypad appears on the right side of the programming area. Enter a new number with the keypad, and then tap the block. Notice how far the cat moves with just one programming block.</p>
<p class="indentb">Let’s explore the meaning of this number a little more.</p>
<p class="order">1. Tap the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button at the top of the screen to show the grid.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_30"></a>
 You will see a grid appear on the stage. This grid will help you keep track of where your characters are on the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now tap your script again. See what happens when the cat moves from one spot to another on the stage? The blue square will move with your cat, and the blue numbered circles will indicate the cat’s new position on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Try to make your cat visit every corner of the stage by using the first four motion blocks in the blue blocks palette.</p>
<p class="order">4. If you start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block and you run the script by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, the cat will reset itself to its starting position before the script runs.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_31"></a>
 This will make it easier for you to make changes in your script and retest it, since the cat will always start from the same location. You can change the cat’s starting position by dragging the cat to another location on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">5. When you are finished having the cat visit all four corners of the stage, save your project by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button (). You’ll return to the home screen, where you can access all of your projects and make new ones.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec18">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There is no block for diagonal movement in ScratchJr. If you want to move the cat to a corner of the screen, you will have to move it to that spot with motion blocks for horizontal steps and vertical steps.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec19">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you have multiple motion blocks of the same kind in a row, see if you can simplify your script by changing the number input.</p>
<p class="indent">Experiment with the Hop block and see what happens when you change the number input.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Notice that changing the number input to 4 will not have the same effect as putting two Hop blocks next to each other.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">This is because the number input on a Hop block controls how high a character will hop, not how many times a character will hop.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb01">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: SPELLING A NAME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you’ve programmed your cat to move, come up with a name for the cat! Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>

 at the top with your cat’s name. Think about how each letter sounds as you try to spell it.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec20">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll create another new project and learn how to use the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks to tilt your cat clockwise or counterclockwise.

<p class="order">5. Now try the same thing with the <strong>Turn Left</strong>
 block!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec22">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Notice that you can drag the cat around on the screen with your finger, and this will reset the cat’s starting position. You can’t rotate the cat with your finger, though! You have to use a motion block to do that.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec23">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See whether you can make the cat do a cartwheel by making it turn and move forward <em>at the same time</em>

<p class="noindent">Think of how a clock’s hands move around its face, and compare that direction to the direction of the cat when it turns. Which one of the turn blocks—Turn Left or Turn Right—moves the cat in the same direction as a clock’s hands?</p>
<p class="indent">See how many times the cat has to turn to go a quarter of the way around a circle. If you double the number input, will the cat turn halfway around the circle?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb06">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can think of the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks in terms of a clock face. Each turn moves the cat “one hour”—that is, one-twelfth of the full circle.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 4: LET’S PLAY HIDE-AND-SEEK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">The cat in this activity is playing a game of hide-and-seek. The cat will disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec24">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 , you used a purple block to make a character say something. In this activity, you will learn how to use the purple Hide and Show blocks to make the cat disappear and reappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, but don’t snap them together yet. Tap the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to see what happens. Now tap the <strong>Show</strong>
 block. These blocks make a character disappear and reappear.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_38"></a>
 3. Now drag two more sets of <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, and snap them onto the first set to make a script that causes the cat to disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the script to see how your cat plays hide-and-seek.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec26">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you combine motion blocks with the Hide and Show blocks, you will see that your cat can still move even when it’s hidden!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec27">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to make your cat disappear and then reappear at another place on the screen. Can you make your cat disappear and then reappear twice, each time moving to a new place on the screen? How about three times?</p>
<p class="indent">Try out other purple looks blocks, such as Grow and Shrink, to see how they change your cat’s appearance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">How large can you make the cat? How small can you make it? Notice what happens when you change the number input on these blocks. See if you can get the cat back to its original size. See whether the Start on Green Flag block has any effect on the cat’s size.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb07">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Why does your cat keep disappearing? Think of a story about why your cat is disappearing and reappearing, and share this story with a friend. Remember to speak clearly and explain what is happening in your scripts to help you tell the story!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb08">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: OBSERVING AND COUNTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of times your cat disappears and how many times it reappears. Does this match the number of blocks you used?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb09">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is helpful to have a conversation about what happens when you place a programming block after the Hide block. Sometimes children have trouble understanding why they cannot see their character complete a script after it has disappeared.</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that a Start on Green Flag block will reset a character’s position, but it will not make a hidden character visible.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec17"><a id="page_40"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb10">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: BUILDING NEW VOCABULARY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>
 —that is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and then improving the program.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec14"><a id="page_28"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 2: MAKE YOUR CAT MOVE!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Can you get the ScratchJr cat to move from one side of the screen to the other? Figure out how many Move Right blocks you need!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec16">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will explore some options for making the cat move on the screen. All motion in ScratchJr follows a grid, and you’ll discover how to change the number of steps along this grid using the motion blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll also learn how to use the Start on Green Flag block to reset your cat’s position so that you can run your script again and again.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec17"><a id="page_29"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can make a very simple script with lots of Move Right blocks, and the cat will take one step to the right for each block. But isn’t it a lot of work to drag and connect all these motion blocks together?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">There must be a better way to do this. . . .</p>
<p class="indent">Aha! There is a number at the bottom of each motion block. Let’s see what happens when you change it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">When you tap the number at the bottom of the motion block, a keypad appears on the right side of the programming area. Enter a new number with the keypad, and then tap the block. Notice how far the cat moves with just one programming block.</p>
<p class="indentb">Let’s explore the meaning of this number a little more.</p>
<p class="order">1. Tap the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button at the top of the screen to show the grid.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_30"></a>
 You will see a grid appear on the stage. This grid will help you keep track of where your characters are on the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now tap your script again. See what happens when the cat moves from one spot to another on the stage? The blue square will move with your cat, and the blue numbered circles will indicate the cat’s new position on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Try to make your cat visit every corner of the stage by using the first four motion blocks in the blue blocks palette.</p>
<p class="order">4. If you start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block and you run the script by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, the cat will reset itself to its starting position before the script runs.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_31"></a>
 This will make it easier for you to make changes in your script and retest it, since the cat will always start from the same location. You can change the cat’s starting position by dragging the cat to another location on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">5. When you are finished having the cat visit all four corners of the stage, save your project by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button (). You’ll return to the home screen, where you can access all of your projects and make new ones.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec18">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There is no block for diagonal movement in ScratchJr. If you want to move the cat to a corner of the screen, you will have to move it to that spot with motion blocks for horizontal steps and vertical steps.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec19">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you have multiple motion blocks of the same kind in a row, see if you can simplify your script by changing the number input.</p>
<p class="indent">Experiment with the Hop block and see what happens when you change the number input.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Notice that changing the number input to 4 will not have the same effect as putting two Hop blocks next to each other.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">This is because the number input on a Hop block controls how high a character will hop, not how many times a character will hop.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_32"><a id="page_32" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb01">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: SPELLING A NAME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you’ve programmed your cat to move, come up with a name for the cat! Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to go to the paint editor, and replace the word <em>Cat</em>
 at the top with your cat’s name. Think about how each letter sounds as you try to spell it.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb02">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: SEEING HOW MANY WAYS YOU CAN GET TO 10</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">See if you can calculate which number on the grid the cat will end up on after you run your script. How many different scripts can you create that will make the cat move to that particular location?</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: there are many different ways to write a script and get to 10! Play around with changing the number inputs for the motion blocks to see what happens.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb03">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Children may have trouble understanding that one motion block can be used to make a character move several steps. Try setting up these two scripts to show how they make a character move the same distance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec15"><a id="page_33"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 3: MAKE YOUR CAT TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Next, you’ll make your cat turn right (clockwise) or left (counterclockwise).</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec20">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll create another new project and learn how to use the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks to tilt your cat clockwise or counterclockwise. See how many times your cat has to turn right or left to make a full circle. Then try thinking of other ways you could use these blocks!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec21"><a id="page_34"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. From the home screen, tap the plus sign to make a new project.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block from the blue blocks palette to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_35"></a>
 3. Change the number input, and tap the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block to see how the cat responds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Experiment to figure out what number will make the cat turn upside down. Then figure out what the number should be to make the cat turn a full circle.</p>
<p class="order">4. Don’t forget to start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block so that the cat returns to a vertical position before turning.</p>
<p class="order">5. Now try the same thing with the <strong>Turn Left</strong>
 block!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec22">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Notice that you can drag the cat around on the screen with your finger, and this will reset the cat’s starting position. You can’t rotate the cat with your finger, though! You have to use a motion block to do that.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec23">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See whether you can make the cat do a cartwheel by making it turn and move forward <em>at the same time</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: use two scripts for this and start both scripts at the same time with a Start on Green Flag block. You can also use this trick with Move Right and Move Up blocks to make the cat move diagonally!</p>

<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TELLING TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of how a clock’s hands move around its face, and compare that direction to the direction of the cat when it turns. Which one of the turn blocks—Turn Left or Turn Right—moves the cat in the same direction as a clock’s hands?</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb10">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb14">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: BUILDING NEW VOCABULARY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>
 —that is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and then improving the program.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">Can you get the ScratchJr cat to move from one side of the screen to the other? Figure out how many Move Right blocks you need!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec16">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will explore some options for making the cat move on the screen. All motion in ScratchJr follows a grid, and you’ll discover how to change the number of steps along this grid using the motion blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll also learn how to use the Start on Green Flag block to reset your cat’s position so that you can run your script again and again.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec17"><a id="page_29"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can make a very simple script with lots of Move Right blocks, and the cat will take one step to the right for each block. But isn’t it a lot of work to drag and connect all these motion blocks together?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">There must be a better way to do this. . . .</p>
<p class="indent">Aha! There is a number at the bottom of each motion block. Let’s see what happens when you change it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">When you tap the number at the bottom of the motion block, a keypad appears on the right side of the programming area. Enter a new number with the keypad, and then tap the block. Notice how far the cat moves with just one programming block.</p>
<p class="indentb">Let’s explore the meaning of this number a little more.</p>
<p class="order">1. Tap the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button at the top of the screen to show the grid.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_30"></a>
 You will see a grid appear on the stage. This grid will help you keep track of where your characters are on the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now tap your script again. See what happens when the cat moves from one spot to another on the stage? The blue square will move with your cat, and the blue numbered circles will indicate the cat’s new position on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Try to make your cat visit every corner of the stage by using the first four motion blocks in the blue blocks palette.</p>
<p class="order">4. If you start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block and you run the script by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, the cat will reset itself to its starting position before the script runs.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_31"></a>
 This will make it easier for you to make changes in your script and retest it, since the cat will always start from the same location. You can change the cat’s starting position by dragging the cat to another location on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">5. When you are finished having the cat visit all four corners of the stage, save your project by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button (). You’ll return to the home screen, where you can access all of your projects and make new ones.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec18">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There is no block for diagonal movement in ScratchJr. If you want to move the cat to a corner of the screen, you will have to move it to that spot with motion blocks for horizontal steps and vertical steps.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec19">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you have multiple motion blocks of the same kind in a row, see if you can simplify your script by changing the number input.</p>
<p class="indent">Experiment with the Hop block and see what happens when you change the number input.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Notice that changing the number input to 4 will not have the same effect as putting two Hop blocks next to each other.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">This is because the number input on a Hop block controls how high a character will hop, not how many times a character will hop.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_32"><a id="page_32" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb01">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: SPELLING A NAME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you’ve programmed your cat to move, come up with a name for the cat! Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to go to the paint editor, and replace the word <em>Cat</em>
 at the top with your cat’s name. Think about how each letter sounds as you try to spell it.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb02">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: SEEING HOW MANY WAYS YOU CAN GET TO 10</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">See if you can calculate which number on the grid the cat will end up on after you run your script. How many different scripts can you create that will make the cat move to that particular location?</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: there are many different ways to write a script and get to 10! Play around with changing the number inputs for the motion blocks to see what happens.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb03">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Children may have trouble understanding that one motion block can be used to make a character move several steps. Try setting up these two scripts to show how they make a character move the same distance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec15"><a id="page_33"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 3: MAKE YOUR CAT TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Next, you’ll make your cat turn right (clockwise) or left (counterclockwise).</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec20">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll create another new project and learn how to use the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks to tilt your cat clockwise or counterclockwise. See how many times your cat has to turn right or left to make a full circle. Then try thinking of other ways you could use these blocks!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec21"><a id="page_34"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. From the home screen, tap the plus sign to make a new project.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block from the blue blocks palette to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_35"></a>
 3. Change the number input, and tap the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block to see how the cat responds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Experiment to figure out what number will make the cat turn upside down. Then figure out what the number should be to make the cat turn a full circle.</p>
<p class="order">4. Don’t forget to start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block so that the cat returns to a vertical position before turning.</p>
<p class="order">5. Now try the same thing with the <strong>Turn Left</strong>
 block!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec22">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Notice that you can drag the cat around on the screen with your finger, and this will reset the cat’s starting position. You can’t rotate the cat with your finger, though! You have to use a motion block to do that.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec23">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See whether you can make the cat do a cartwheel by making it turn and move forward <em>at the same time</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: use two scripts for this and start both scripts at the same time with a Start on Green Flag block. You can also use this trick with Move Right and Move Up blocks to make the cat move diagonally!</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb04">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: DESCRIBING FEELINGS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of a story about why your cat is spinning. Is the cat happy? Sad? Dizzy? Explain your project to a friend, and make sure they understand why your cat is feeling that way.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb05">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TELLING TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of how a clock’s hands move around its face, and compare that direction to the direction of the cat when it turns. Which one of the turn blocks—Turn Left or Turn Right—moves the cat in the same direction as a clock’s hands?</p>
<p class="indent">See how many times the cat has to turn to go a quarter of the way around a circle. If you double the number input, will the cat turn halfway around the circle?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb06">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can think of the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks in terms of a clock face. Each turn moves the cat “one hour”—that is, one-twelfth of the full circle.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 4: LET’S PLAY HIDE-AND-SEEK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">The cat in this activity is playing a game of hide-and-seek. The cat will disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec24">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 , you used a purple block to make a character say something. In this activity, you will learn how to use the purple Hide and Show blocks to make the cat disappear and reappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, but don’t snap them together yet. Tap the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to see what happens. Now tap the <strong>Show</strong>
 block. These blocks make a character disappear and reappear.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_38"></a>
 3. Now drag two more sets of <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, and snap them onto the first set to make a script that causes the cat to disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the script to see how your cat plays hide-and-seek.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec26">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you combine motion blocks with the Hide and Show blocks, you will see that your cat can still move even when it’s hidden!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec27">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to make your cat disappear and then reappear at another place on the screen. Can you make your cat disappear and then reappear twice, each time moving to a new place on the screen? How about three times?</p>
<p class="indent">Try out other purple looks blocks, such as Grow and Shrink, to see how they change your cat’s appearance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">How large can you make the cat? How small can you make it? Notice what happens when you change the number input on these blocks. See if you can get the cat back to its original size. See whether the Start on Green Flag block has any effect on the cat’s size.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb07">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Why does your cat keep disappearing? Think of a story about why your cat is disappearing and reappearing, and share this story with a friend. Remember to speak clearly and explain what is happening in your scripts to help you tell the story!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb08">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: OBSERVING AND COUNTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of times your cat disappears and how many times it reappears. Does this match the number of blocks you used?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb09">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is helpful to have a conversation about what happens when you place a programming block after the Hide block. Sometimes children have trouble understanding why they cannot see their character complete a script after it has disappeared.</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that a Start on Green Flag block will reset a character’s position, but it will not make a hidden character visible.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec17"><a id="page_40"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb14">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: BUILDING NEW VOCABULARY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>
 —that is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and then improving the program.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec16">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will explore some options for making the cat move on the screen. All motion in ScratchJr follows a grid, and you’ll discover how to change the number of steps along this grid using the motion blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll also learn how to use the Start on Green Flag block to reset your cat’s position so that you can run your script again and again.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec17"><a id="page_29"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can make a very simple script with lots of Move Right blocks, and the cat will take one step to the right for each block. But isn’t it a lot of work to drag and connect all these motion blocks together?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">There must be a better way to do this. . . .</p>
<p class="indent">Aha! There is a number at the bottom of each motion block. Let’s see what happens when you change it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">When you tap the number at the bottom of the motion block, a keypad appears on the right side of the programming area. Enter a new number with the keypad, and then tap the block. Notice how far the cat moves with just one programming block.</p>
<p class="indentb">Let’s explore the meaning of this number a little more.</p>
<p class="order">1. Tap the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button at the top of the screen to show the grid.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_30"></a>
 You will see a grid appear on the stage. This grid will help you keep track of where your characters are on the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now tap your script again. See what happens when the cat moves from one spot to another on the stage? The blue square will move with your cat, and the blue numbered circles will indicate the cat’s new position on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Try to make your cat visit every corner of the stage by using the first four motion blocks in the blue blocks palette.</p>
<p class="order">4. If you start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block and you run the script by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, the cat will reset itself to its starting position before the script runs.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_31"></a>
 This will make it easier for you to make changes in your script and retest it, since the cat will always start from the same location. You can change the cat’s starting position by dragging the cat to another location on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">5. When you are finished having the cat visit all four corners of the stage, save your project by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button (). You’ll return to the home screen, where you can access all of your projects and make new ones.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec18">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There is no block for diagonal movement in ScratchJr. If you want to move the cat to a corner of the screen, you will have to move it to that spot with motion blocks for horizontal steps and vertical steps.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec19">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you have multiple motion blocks of the same kind in a row, see if you can simplify your script by changing the number input.</p>
<p class="indent">Experiment with the Hop block and see what happens when you change the number input.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Notice that changing the number input to 4 will not have the same effect as putting two Hop blocks next to each other.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">This is because the number input on a Hop block controls how high a character will hop, not how many times a character will hop.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_32"><a id="page_32" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb01">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: SPELLING A NAME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you’ve programmed your cat to move, come up with a name for the cat! Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to go to the paint editor, and replace the word <em>Cat</em>
 at the top with your cat’s name. Think about how each letter sounds as you try to spell it.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb02">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: SEEING HOW MANY WAYS YOU CAN GET TO 10</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">See if you can calculate which number on the grid the cat will end up on after you run your script. How many different scripts can you create that will make the cat move to that particular location?</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: there are many different ways to write a script and get to 10! Play around with changing the number inputs for the motion blocks to see what happens.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb03">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Children may have trouble understanding that one motion block can be used to make a character move several steps. Try setting up these two scripts to show how they make a character move the same distance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec15"><a id="page_33"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 3: MAKE YOUR CAT TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Next, you’ll make your cat turn right (clockwise) or left (counterclockwise).</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec20">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll create another new project and learn how to use the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks to tilt your cat clockwise or counterclockwise. See how many times your cat has to turn right or left to make a full circle. Then try thinking of other ways you could use these blocks!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec21"><a id="page_34"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. From the home screen, tap the plus sign to make a new project.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block from the blue blocks palette to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_35"></a>
 3. Change the number input, and tap the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block to see how the cat responds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Experiment to figure out what number will make the cat turn upside down. Then figure out what the number should be to make the cat turn a full circle.</p>
<p class="order">4. Don’t forget to start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block so that the cat returns to a vertical position before turning.</p>
<p class="order">5. Now try the same thing with the <strong>Turn Left</strong>
 block!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec22">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Notice that you can drag the cat around on the screen with your finger, and this will reset the cat’s starting position. You can’t rotate the cat with your finger, though! You have to use a motion block to do that.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec23">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See whether you can make the cat do a cartwheel by making it turn and move forward <em>at the same time</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: use two scripts for this and start both scripts at the same time with a Start on Green Flag block. You can also use this trick with Move Right and Move Up blocks to make the cat move diagonally!</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_36"><a id="page_36" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb04">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: DESCRIBING FEELINGS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of a story about why your cat is spinning. Is the cat happy? Sad? Dizzy? Explain your project to a friend, and make sure they understand why your cat is feeling that way.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb05">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TELLING TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of how a clock’s hands move around its face, and compare that direction to the direction of the cat when it turns. Which one of the turn blocks—Turn Left or Turn Right—moves the cat in the same direction as a clock’s hands?</p>
<p class="indent">See how many times the cat has to turn to go a quarter of the way around a circle. If you double the number input, will the cat turn halfway around the circle?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb06">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can think of the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks in terms of a clock face. Each turn moves the cat “one hour”—that is, one-twelfth of the full circle.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec16"><a id="page_37"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 4: LET’S PLAY HIDE-AND-SEEK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">The cat in this activity is playing a game of hide-and-seek. The cat will disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec24">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 , you used a purple block to make a character say something. In this activity, you will learn how to use the purple Hide and Show blocks to make the cat disappear and reappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, but don’t snap them together yet. Tap the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to see what happens. Now tap the <strong>Show</strong>
 block. These blocks make a character disappear and reappear.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_38"></a>
 3. Now drag two more sets of <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, and snap them onto the first set to make a script that causes the cat to disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the script to see how your cat plays hide-and-seek.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec26">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you combine motion blocks with the Hide and Show blocks, you will see that your cat can still move even when it’s hidden!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec27">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to make your cat disappear and then reappear at another place on the screen. Can you make your cat disappear and then reappear twice, each time moving to a new place on the screen? How about three times?</p>
<p class="indent">Try out other purple looks blocks, such as Grow and Shrink, to see how they change your cat’s appearance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">How large can you make the cat? How small can you make it? Notice what happens when you change the number input on these blocks. See if you can get the cat back to its original size. See whether the Start on Green Flag block has any effect on the cat’s size.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_39"><a id="page_39" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb07">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Why does your cat keep disappearing? Think of a story about why your cat is disappearing and reappearing, and share this story with a friend. Remember to speak clearly and explain what is happening in your scripts to help you tell the story!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb08">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: OBSERVING AND COUNTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of times your cat disappears and how many times it reappears. Does this match the number of blocks you used?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb09">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is helpful to have a conversation about what happens when you place a programming block after the Hide block. Sometimes children have trouble understanding why they cannot see their character complete a script after it has disappeared.</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that a Start on Green Flag block will reset a character’s position, but it will not make a hidden character visible.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec17"><a id="page_40"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_43"><a id="page_43" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb10">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

<p class="noindent">In this activity, you will explore some options for making the cat move on the screen. All motion in ScratchJr follows a grid, and you’ll discover how to change the number of steps along this grid using the motion blocks.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll also learn how to use the Start on Green Flag block to reset your cat’s position so that you can run your script again and again.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec17"><a id="page_29"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can make a very simple script with lots of Move Right blocks, and the cat will take one step to the right for each block. But isn’t it a lot of work to drag and connect all these motion blocks together?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">There must be a better way to do this. . . .</p>
<p class="indent">Aha! There is a number at the bottom of each motion block. Let’s see what happens when you change it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">When you tap the number at the bottom of the motion block, a keypad appears on the right side of the programming area. Enter a new number with the keypad, and then tap the block. Notice how far the cat moves with just one programming block.</p>
<p class="indentb">Let’s explore the meaning of this number a little more.</p>
<p class="order">1. Tap the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button at the top of the screen to show the grid.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_30"></a>
 You will see a grid appear on the stage. This grid will help you keep track of where your characters are on the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now tap your script again. See what happens when the cat moves from one spot to another on the stage? The blue square will move with your cat, and the blue numbered circles will indicate the cat’s new position on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Try to make your cat visit every corner of the stage by using the first four motion blocks in the blue blocks palette.</p>
<p class="order">4. If you start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block and you run the script by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, the cat will reset itself to its starting position before the script runs.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_31"></a>
 This will make it easier for you to make changes in your script and retest it, since the cat will always start from the same location. You can change the cat’s starting position by dragging the cat to another location on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">5. When you are finished having the cat visit all four corners of the stage, save your project by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button (). You’ll return to the home screen, where you can access all of your projects and make new ones.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec18">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There is no block for diagonal movement in ScratchJr. If you want to move the cat to a corner of the screen, you will have to move it to that spot with motion blocks for horizontal steps and vertical steps.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec19">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you have multiple motion blocks of the same kind in a row, see if you can simplify your script by changing the number input.</p>
<p class="indent">Experiment with the Hop block and see what happens when you change the number input.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Notice that changing the number input to 4 will not have the same effect as putting two Hop blocks next to each other.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">This is because the number input on a Hop block controls how high a character will hop, not how many times a character will hop.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb01">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: SPELLING A NAME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you’ve programmed your cat to move, come up with a name for the cat! Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to go to the paint editor, and replace the word <em>Cat</em>
 at the top with your cat’s name. Think about how each letter sounds as you try to spell it.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb02">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: SEEING HOW MANY WAYS YOU CAN GET TO 10</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">See if you can calculate which number on the grid the cat will end up on after you run your script. How many different scripts can you create that will make the cat move to that particular location?</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: there are many different ways to write a script and get to 10! Play around with changing the number inputs for the motion blocks to see what happens.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb03">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Children may have trouble understanding that one motion block can be used to make a character move several steps. Try setting up these two scripts to show how they make a character move the same distance.</p>

</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec15"><a id="page_33"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 3: MAKE YOUR CAT TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Next, you’ll make your cat turn right (clockwise) or left (counterclockwise).</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec20">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll create another new project and learn how to use the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks to tilt your cat clockwise or counterclockwise. See how many times your cat has to turn right or left to make a full circle. Then try thinking of other ways you could use these blocks!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec21"><a id="page_34"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. From the home screen, tap the plus sign to make a new project.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block from the blue blocks palette to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_35"></a>
 3. Change the number input, and tap the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block to see how the cat responds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Experiment to figure out what number will make the cat turn upside down. Then figure out what the number should be to make the cat turn a full circle.</p>
<p class="order">4. Don’t forget to start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block so that the cat returns to a vertical position before turning.</p>
<p class="order">5. Now try the same thing with the <strong>Turn Left</strong>
 block!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec22">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Notice that you can drag the cat around on the screen with your finger, and this will reset the cat’s starting position. You can’t rotate the cat with your finger, though! You have to use a motion block to do that.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec23">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See whether you can make the cat do a cartwheel by making it turn and move forward <em>at the same time</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: use two scripts for this and start both scripts at the same time with a Start on Green Flag block. You can also use this trick with Move Right and Move Up blocks to make the cat move diagonally!</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb04">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: DESCRIBING FEELINGS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of a story about why your cat is spinning. Is the cat happy? Sad? Dizzy? Explain your project to a friend, and make sure they understand why your cat is feeling that way.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb05">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TELLING TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of how a clock’s hands move around its face, and compare that direction to the direction of the cat when it turns. Which one of the turn blocks—Turn Left or Turn Right—moves the cat in the same direction as a clock’s hands?</p>
<p class="indent">See how many times the cat has to turn to go a quarter of the way around a circle. If you double the number input, will the cat turn halfway around the circle?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb06">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can think of the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks in terms of a clock face. Each turn moves the cat “one hour”—that is, one-twelfth of the full circle.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 4: LET’S PLAY HIDE-AND-SEEK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">The cat in this activity is playing a game of hide-and-seek. The cat will disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec24">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 , you used a purple block to make a character say something. In this activity, you will learn how to use the purple Hide and Show blocks to make the cat disappear and reappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, but don’t snap them together yet. Tap the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to see what happens. Now tap the <strong>Show</strong>
 block. These blocks make a character disappear and reappear.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_38"></a>
 3. Now drag two more sets of <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, and snap them onto the first set to make a script that causes the cat to disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the script to see how your cat plays hide-and-seek.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec26">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you combine motion blocks with the Hide and Show blocks, you will see that your cat can still move even when it’s hidden!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec27">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to make your cat disappear and then reappear at another place on the screen. Can you make your cat disappear and then reappear twice, each time moving to a new place on the screen? How about three times?</p>
<p class="indent">Try out other purple looks blocks, such as Grow and Shrink, to see how they change your cat’s appearance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">How large can you make the cat? How small can you make it? Notice what happens when you change the number input on these blocks. See if you can get the cat back to its original size. See whether the Start on Green Flag block has any effect on the cat’s size.</p>

<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_39"><a id="page_39" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb07">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Why does your cat keep disappearing? Think of a story about why your cat is disappearing and reappearing, and share this story with a friend. Remember to speak clearly and explain what is happening in your scripts to help you tell the story!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb08">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: OBSERVING AND COUNTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of times your cat disappears and how many times it reappears. Does this match the number of blocks you used?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb09">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is helpful to have a conversation about what happens when you place a programming block after the Hide block. Sometimes children have trouble understanding why they cannot see their character complete a script after it has disappeared.</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that a Start on Green Flag block will reset a character’s position, but it will not make a hidden character visible.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec17"><a id="page_40"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb10">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">When you tap the number at the bottom of the motion block, a keypad appears on the right side of the programming area. Enter a new number with the keypad, and then tap the block. Notice how far the cat moves with just one programming block.</p>
<p class="indentb">Let’s explore the meaning of this number a little more.</p>
<p class="order">1. Tap the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button at the top of the screen to show the grid.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_30"></a>
 You will see a grid appear on the stage. This grid will help you keep track of where your characters are on the stage.</p>

<p class="order">2. Now tap your script again. See what happens when the cat moves from one spot to another on the stage? The blue square will move with your cat, and the blue numbered circles will indicate the cat’s new position on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Try to make your cat visit every corner of the stage by using the first four motion blocks in the blue blocks palette.</p>
<p class="order">4. If you start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_31"></a>
 This will make it easier for you to make changes in your script and retest it, since the cat will always start from the same location. You can change the cat’s starting position by dragging the cat to another location on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">5. When you are finished having the cat visit all four corners of the stage, save your project by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 3: MAKE YOUR CAT TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Next, you’ll make your cat turn right (clockwise) or left (counterclockwise).</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec20">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll create another new project and learn how to use the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks to tilt your cat clockwise or counterclockwise. See how many times your cat has to turn right or left to make a full circle. Then try thinking of other ways you could use these blocks!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec21"><a id="page_34"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. From the home screen, tap the plus sign to make a new project.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block from the blue blocks palette to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_35"></a>
 3. Change the number input, and tap the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block to see how the cat responds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Experiment to figure out what number will make the cat turn upside down. Then figure out what the number should be to make the cat turn a full circle.</p>
<p class="order">4. Don’t forget to start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block so that the cat returns to a vertical position before turning.</p>
<p class="order">5. Now try the same thing with the <strong>Turn Left</strong>
 block!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec22">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Notice that you can drag the cat around on the screen with your finger, and this will reset the cat’s starting position. You can’t rotate the cat with your finger, though! You have to use a motion block to do that.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec23">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See whether you can make the cat do a cartwheel by making it turn and move forward <em>at the same time</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: use two scripts for this and start both scripts at the same time with a Start on Green Flag block. You can also use this trick with Move Right and Move Up blocks to make the cat move diagonally!</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb04">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: DESCRIBING FEELINGS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of a story about why your cat is spinning. Is the cat happy? Sad? Dizzy? Explain your project to a friend, and make sure they understand why your cat is feeling that way.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb05">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TELLING TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of how a clock’s hands move around its face, and compare that direction to the direction of the cat when it turns. Which one of the turn blocks—Turn Left or Turn Right—moves the cat in the same direction as a clock’s hands?</p>
<p class="indent">See how many times the cat has to turn to go a quarter of the way around a circle. If you double the number input, will the cat turn halfway around the circle?</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 4: LET’S PLAY HIDE-AND-SEEK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">The cat in this activity is playing a game of hide-and-seek. The cat will disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec24">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 , you used a purple block to make a character say something. In this activity, you will learn how to use the purple Hide and Show blocks to make the cat disappear and reappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, but don’t snap them together yet. Tap the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to see what happens. Now tap the <strong>Show</strong>
 block. These blocks make a character disappear and reappear.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_38"></a>
 3. Now drag two more sets of <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, and snap them onto the first set to make a script that causes the cat to disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the script to see how your cat plays hide-and-seek.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec26">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you combine motion blocks with the Hide and Show blocks, you will see that your cat can still move even when it’s hidden!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec27">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to make your cat disappear and then reappear at another place on the screen. Can you make your cat disappear and then reappear twice, each time moving to a new place on the screen? How about three times?</p>
<p class="indent">Try out other purple looks blocks, such as Grow and Shrink, to see how they change your cat’s appearance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">How large can you make the cat? How small can you make it? Notice what happens when you change the number input on these blocks. See if you can get the cat back to its original size. See whether the Start on Green Flag block has any effect on the cat’s size.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb07">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Why does your cat keep disappearing? Think of a story about why your cat is disappearing and reappearing, and share this story with a friend. Remember to speak clearly and explain what is happening in your scripts to help you tell the story!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb08">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: OBSERVING AND COUNTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of times your cat disappears and how many times it reappears. Does this match the number of blocks you used?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb09">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is helpful to have a conversation about what happens when you place a programming block after the Hide block. Sometimes children have trouble understanding why they cannot see their character complete a script after it has disappeared.</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that a Start on Green Flag block will reset a character’s position, but it will not make a hidden character visible.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec17"><a id="page_40"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb10">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: BUILDING NEW VOCABULARY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>
 —that is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and then improving the program.</p>
</div>

</html>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec17"><a id="page_29"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can make a very simple script with lots of Move Right blocks, and the cat will take one step to the right for each block. But isn’t it a lot of work to drag and connect all these motion blocks together?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">There must be a better way to do this. . . .</p>
<p class="indent">Aha! There is a number at the bottom of each motion block. Let’s see what happens when you change it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">When you tap the number at the bottom of the motion block, a keypad appears on the right side of the programming area. Enter a new number with the keypad, and then tap the block. Notice how far the cat moves with just one programming block.</p>
<p class="indentb">Let’s explore the meaning of this number a little more.</p>
<p class="order">1. Tap the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button at the top of the screen to show the grid.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_30"></a>
 You will see a grid appear on the stage. This grid will help you keep track of where your characters are on the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now tap your script again. See what happens when the cat moves from one spot to another on the stage? The blue square will move with your cat, and the blue numbered circles will indicate the cat’s new position on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Try to make your cat visit every corner of the stage by using the first four motion blocks in the blue blocks palette.</p>
<p class="order">4. If you start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block and you run the script by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, the cat will reset itself to its starting position before the script runs.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_31"></a>
 This will make it easier for you to make changes in your script and retest it, since the cat will always start from the same location. You can change the cat’s starting position by dragging the cat to another location on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">5. When you are finished having the cat visit all four corners of the stage, save your project by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button (). You’ll return to the home screen, where you can access all of your projects and make new ones.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec18">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There is no block for diagonal movement in ScratchJr. If you want to move the cat to a corner of the screen, you will have to move it to that spot with motion blocks for horizontal steps and vertical steps.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec19">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you have multiple motion blocks of the same kind in a row, see if you can simplify your script by changing the number input.</p>
<p class="indent">Experiment with the Hop block and see what happens when you change the number input.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Notice that changing the number input to 4 will not have the same effect as putting two Hop blocks next to each other.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">This is because the number input on a Hop block controls how high a character will hop, not how many times a character will hop.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb01">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: SPELLING A NAME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you’ve programmed your cat to move, come up with a name for the cat! Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to go to the paint editor, and replace the word <em>Cat</em>
 at the top with your cat’s name. Think about how each letter sounds as you try to spell it.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb02">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: SEEING HOW MANY WAYS YOU CAN GET TO 10</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">See if you can calculate which number on the grid the cat will end up on after you run your script. How many different scripts can you create that will make the cat move to that particular location?</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: there are many different ways to write a script and get to 10! Play around with changing the number inputs for the motion blocks to see what happens.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb03">

<p class="order"><a id="page_38"></a>
 3. Now drag two more sets of <strong>Hide</strong>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb10">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: BUILDING NEW VOCABULARY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>
 —that is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and then improving the program.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">You can make a very simple script with lots of Move Right blocks, and the cat will take one step to the right for each block. But isn’t it a lot of work to drag and connect all these motion blocks together?</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">There must be a better way to do this. . . .</p>
<p class="indent">Aha! There is a number at the bottom of each motion block. Let’s see what happens when you change it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">When you tap the number at the bottom of the motion block, a keypad appears on the right side of the programming area. Enter a new number with the keypad, and then tap the block. Notice how far the cat moves with just one programming block.</p>
<p class="indentb">Let’s explore the meaning of this number a little more.</p>
<p class="order">1. Tap the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button at the top of the screen to show the grid.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_30"></a>
 You will see a grid appear on the stage. This grid will help you keep track of where your characters are on the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now tap your script again. See what happens when the cat moves from one spot to another on the stage? The blue square will move with your cat, and the blue numbered circles will indicate the cat’s new position on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Try to make your cat visit every corner of the stage by using the first four motion blocks in the blue blocks palette.</p>
<p class="order">4. If you start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block and you run the script by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, the cat will reset itself to its starting position before the script runs.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_31"></a>
 This will make it easier for you to make changes in your script and retest it, since the cat will always start from the same location. You can change the cat’s starting position by dragging the cat to another location on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">5. When you are finished having the cat visit all four corners of the stage, save your project by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button (). You’ll return to the home screen, where you can access all of your projects and make new ones.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec18">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There is no block for diagonal movement in ScratchJr. If you want to move the cat to a corner of the screen, you will have to move it to that spot with motion blocks for horizontal steps and vertical steps.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec19">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you have multiple motion blocks of the same kind in a row, see if you can simplify your script by changing the number input.</p>
<p class="indent">Experiment with the Hop block and see what happens when you change the number input.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Notice that changing the number input to 4 will not have the same effect as putting two Hop blocks next to each other.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">This is because the number input on a Hop block controls how high a character will hop, not how many times a character will hop.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb01">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: SPELLING A NAME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you’ve programmed your cat to move, come up with a name for the cat! Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to go to the paint editor, and replace the word <em>Cat</em>
 at the top with your cat’s name. Think about how each letter sounds as you try to spell it.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb02">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: SEEING HOW MANY WAYS YOU CAN GET TO 10</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">See if you can calculate which number on the grid the cat will end up on after you run your script. How many different scripts can you create that will make the cat move to that particular location?</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: there are many different ways to write a script and get to 10! Play around with changing the number inputs for the motion blocks to see what happens.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb03">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Children may have trouble understanding that one motion block can be used to make a character move several steps. Try setting up these two scripts to show how they make a character move the same distance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec15"><a id="page_33"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 3: MAKE YOUR CAT TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Next, you’ll make your cat turn right (clockwise) or left (counterclockwise).</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec20">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll create another new project and learn how to use the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks to tilt your cat clockwise or counterclockwise. See how many times your cat has to turn right or left to make a full circle. Then try thinking of other ways you could use these blocks!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec21"><a id="page_34"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. From the home screen, tap the plus sign to make a new project.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block from the blue blocks palette to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_35"></a>
 3. Change the number input, and tap the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block to see how the cat responds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Experiment to figure out what number will make the cat turn upside down. Then figure out what the number should be to make the cat turn a full circle.</p>
<p class="order">4. Don’t forget to start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block so that the cat returns to a vertical position before turning.</p>
<p class="order">5. Now try the same thing with the <strong>Turn Left</strong>
 block!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec22">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Notice that you can drag the cat around on the screen with your finger, and this will reset the cat’s starting position. You can’t rotate the cat with your finger, though! You have to use a motion block to do that.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec23">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See whether you can make the cat do a cartwheel by making it turn and move forward <em>at the same time</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: use two scripts for this and start both scripts at the same time with a Start on Green Flag block. You can also use this trick with Move Right and Move Up blocks to make the cat move diagonally!</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb05">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TELLING TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of how a clock’s hands move around its face, and compare that direction to the direction of the cat when it turns. Which one of the turn blocks—Turn Left or Turn Right—moves the cat in the same direction as a clock’s hands?</p>
<p class="indent">See how many times the cat has to turn to go a quarter of the way around a circle. If you double the number input, will the cat turn halfway around the circle?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb06">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can think of the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks in terms of a clock face. Each turn moves the cat “one hour”—that is, one-twelfth of the full circle.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>

</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book!

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb14">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: BUILDING NEW VOCABULARY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>
 —that is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and then improving the program.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">There must be a better way to do this. . . .</p>
<p class="indent">Aha! There is a number at the bottom of each motion block. Let’s see what happens when you change it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">When you tap the number at the bottom of the motion block, a keypad appears on the right side of the programming area. Enter a new number with the keypad, and then tap the block. Notice how far the cat moves with just one programming block.</p>
<p class="indentb">Let’s explore the meaning of this number a little more.</p>
<p class="order">1. Tap the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button at the top of the screen to show the grid.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_30"></a>
 You will see a grid appear on the stage. This grid will help you keep track of where your characters are on the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now tap your script again. See what happens when the cat moves from one spot to another on the stage? The blue square will move with your cat, and the blue numbered circles will indicate the cat’s new position on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Try to make your cat visit every corner of the stage by using the first four motion blocks in the blue blocks palette.</p>
<p class="order">4. If you start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block and you run the script by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, the cat will reset itself to its starting position before the script runs.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_31"></a>
 This will make it easier for you to make changes in your script and retest it, since the cat will always start from the same location. You can change the cat’s starting position by dragging the cat to another location on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">5. When you are finished having the cat visit all four corners of the stage, save your project by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button (). You’ll return to the home screen, where you can access all of your projects and make new ones.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec18">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There is no block for diagonal movement in ScratchJr. If you want to move the cat to a corner of the screen, you will have to move it to that spot with motion blocks for horizontal steps and vertical steps.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec19">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you have multiple motion blocks of the same kind in a row, see if you can simplify your script by changing the number input.</p>
<p class="indent">Experiment with the Hop block and see what happens when you change the number input.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Notice that changing the number input to 4 will not have the same effect as putting two Hop blocks next to each other.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">This is because the number input on a Hop block controls how high a character will hop, not how many times a character will hop.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_32"><a id="page_32" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb01">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: SPELLING A NAME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you’ve programmed your cat to move, come up with a name for the cat! Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to go to the paint editor, and replace the word <em>Cat</em>
 at the top with your cat’s name. Think about how each letter sounds as you try to spell it.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb02">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: SEEING HOW MANY WAYS YOU CAN GET TO 10</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">See if you can calculate which number on the grid the cat will end up on after you run your script. How many different scripts can you create that will make the cat move to that particular location?</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: there are many different ways to write a script and get to 10! Play around with changing the number inputs for the motion blocks to see what happens.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb03">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Children may have trouble understanding that one motion block can be used to make a character move several steps. Try setting up these two scripts to show how they make a character move the same distance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec15"><a id="page_33"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 3: MAKE YOUR CAT TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Next, you’ll make your cat turn right (clockwise) or left (counterclockwise).</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec20">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll create another new project and learn how to use the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks to tilt your cat clockwise or counterclockwise. See how many times your cat has to turn right or left to make a full circle. Then try thinking of other ways you could use these blocks!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec21"><a id="page_34"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. From the home screen, tap the plus sign to make a new project.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block from the blue blocks palette to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_35"></a>
 3. Change the number input, and tap the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block to see how the cat responds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Experiment to figure out what number will make the cat turn upside down. Then figure out what the number should be to make the cat turn a full circle.</p>
<p class="order">4. Don’t forget to start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block so that the cat returns to a vertical position before turning.</p>
<p class="order">5. Now try the same thing with the <strong>Turn Left</strong>
 block!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec22">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Notice that you can drag the cat around on the screen with your finger, and this will reset the cat’s starting position. You can’t rotate the cat with your finger, though! You have to use a motion block to do that.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec23">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See whether you can make the cat do a cartwheel by making it turn and move forward <em>at the same time</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: use two scripts for this and start both scripts at the same time with a Start on Green Flag block. You can also use this trick with Move Right and Move Up blocks to make the cat move diagonally!</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb04">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: DESCRIBING FEELINGS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of a story about why your cat is spinning. Is the cat happy? Sad? Dizzy? Explain your project to a friend, and make sure they understand why your cat is feeling that way.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb05">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TELLING TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of how a clock’s hands move around its face, and compare that direction to the direction of the cat when it turns. Which one of the turn blocks—Turn Left or Turn Right—moves the cat in the same direction as a clock’s hands?</p>
<p class="indent">See how many times the cat has to turn to go a quarter of the way around a circle. If you double the number input, will the cat turn halfway around the circle?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb06">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can think of the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks in terms of a clock face. Each turn moves the cat “one hour”—that is, one-twelfth of the full circle.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 4: LET’S PLAY HIDE-AND-SEEK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">The cat in this activity is playing a game of hide-and-seek. The cat will disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec24">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 , you used a purple block to make a character say something. In this activity, you will learn how to use the purple Hide and Show blocks to make the cat disappear and reappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, but don’t snap them together yet. Tap the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to see what happens. Now tap the <strong>Show</strong>
 block. These blocks make a character disappear and reappear.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_38"></a>
 3. Now drag two more sets of <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, and snap them onto the first set to make a script that causes the cat to disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the script to see how your cat plays hide-and-seek.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec26">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you combine motion blocks with the Hide and Show blocks, you will see that your cat can still move even when it’s hidden!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec27">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to make your cat disappear and then reappear at another place on the screen. Can you make your cat disappear and then reappear twice, each time moving to a new place on the screen? How about three times?</p>
<p class="indent">Try out other purple looks blocks, such as Grow and Shrink, to see how they change your cat’s appearance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">How large can you make the cat? How small can you make it? Notice what happens when you change the number input on these blocks. See if you can get the cat back to its original size. See whether the Start on Green Flag block has any effect on the cat’s size.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_39"><a id="page_39" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb07">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Why does your cat keep disappearing? Think of a story about why your cat is disappearing and reappearing, and share this story with a friend. Remember to speak clearly and explain what is happening in your scripts to help you tell the story!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb08">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: OBSERVING AND COUNTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of times your cat disappears and how many times it reappears. Does this match the number of blocks you used?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb09">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is helpful to have a conversation about what happens when you place a programming block after the Hide block. Sometimes children have trouble understanding why they cannot see their character complete a script after it has disappeared.</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that a Start on Green Flag block will reset a character’s position, but it will not make a hidden character visible.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec17"><a id="page_40"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

<p class="indent">Aha! There is a number at the bottom of each motion block. Let’s see what happens when you change it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">When you tap the number at the bottom of the motion block, a keypad appears on the right side of the programming area. Enter a new number with the keypad, and then tap the block. Notice how far the cat moves with just one programming block.</p>
<p class="indentb">Let’s explore the meaning of this number a little more.</p>
<p class="order">1. Tap the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button at the top of the screen to show the grid.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_30"></a>
 You will see a grid appear on the stage. This grid will help you keep track of where your characters are on the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now tap your script again. See what happens when the cat moves from one spot to another on the stage? The blue square will move with your cat, and the blue numbered circles will indicate the cat’s new position on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Try to make your cat visit every corner of the stage by using the first four motion blocks in the blue blocks palette.</p>
<p class="order">4. If you start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block and you run the script by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, the cat will reset itself to its starting position before the script runs.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_31"></a>
 This will make it easier for you to make changes in your script and retest it, since the cat will always start from the same location. You can change the cat’s starting position by dragging the cat to another location on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">5. When you are finished having the cat visit all four corners of the stage, save your project by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button (). You’ll return to the home screen, where you can access all of your projects and make new ones.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec18">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There is no block for diagonal movement in ScratchJr. If you want to move the cat to a corner of the screen, you will have to move it to that spot with motion blocks for horizontal steps and vertical steps.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec19">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you have multiple motion blocks of the same kind in a row, see if you can simplify your script by changing the number input.</p>
<p class="indent">Experiment with the Hop block and see what happens when you change the number input.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Notice that changing the number input to 4 will not have the same effect as putting two Hop blocks next to each other.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">This is because the number input on a Hop block controls how high a character will hop, not how many times a character will hop.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 3: MAKE YOUR CAT TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Next, you’ll make your cat turn right (clockwise) or left (counterclockwise).</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec20">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll create another new project and learn how to use the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks to tilt your cat clockwise or counterclockwise. See how many times your cat has to turn right or left to make a full circle. Then try thinking of other ways you could use these blocks!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec21"><a id="page_34"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. From the home screen, tap the plus sign to make a new project.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block from the blue blocks palette to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_35"></a>
 3. Change the number input, and tap the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block to see how the cat responds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Experiment to figure out what number will make the cat turn upside down. Then figure out what the number should be to make the cat turn a full circle.</p>
<p class="order">4. Don’t forget to start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block so that the cat returns to a vertical position before turning.</p>
<p class="order">5. Now try the same thing with the <strong>Turn Left</strong>
 block!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec22">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Notice that you can drag the cat around on the screen with your finger, and this will reset the cat’s starting position. You can’t rotate the cat with your finger, though! You have to use a motion block to do that.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec23">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See whether you can make the cat do a cartwheel by making it turn and move forward <em>at the same time</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: use two scripts for this and start both scripts at the same time with a Start on Green Flag block. You can also use this trick with Move Right and Move Up blocks to make the cat move diagonally!</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb05">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TELLING TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of how a clock’s hands move around its face, and compare that direction to the direction of the cat when it turns. Which one of the turn blocks—Turn Left or Turn Right—moves the cat in the same direction as a clock’s hands?</p>
<p class="indent">See how many times the cat has to turn to go a quarter of the way around a circle. If you double the number input, will the cat turn halfway around the circle?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb06">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can think of the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks in terms of a clock face. Each turn moves the cat “one hour”—that is, one-twelfth of the full circle.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 4: LET’S PLAY HIDE-AND-SEEK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">The cat in this activity is playing a game of hide-and-seek. The cat will disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec24">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 , you used a purple block to make a character say something. In this activity, you will learn how to use the purple Hide and Show blocks to make the cat disappear and reappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, but don’t snap them together yet. Tap the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to see what happens. Now tap the <strong>Show</strong>
 block. These blocks make a character disappear and reappear.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_38"></a>
 3. Now drag two more sets of <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, and snap them onto the first set to make a script that causes the cat to disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the script to see how your cat plays hide-and-seek.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec26">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you combine motion blocks with the Hide and Show blocks, you will see that your cat can still move even when it’s hidden!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec27">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to make your cat disappear and then reappear at another place on the screen. Can you make your cat disappear and then reappear twice, each time moving to a new place on the screen? How about three times?</p>
<p class="indent">Try out other purple looks blocks, such as Grow and Shrink, to see how they change your cat’s appearance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">How large can you make the cat? How small can you make it? Notice what happens when you change the number input on these blocks. See if you can get the cat back to its original size. See whether the Start on Green Flag block has any effect on the cat’s size.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb07">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Why does your cat keep disappearing? Think of a story about why your cat is disappearing and reappearing, and share this story with a friend. Remember to speak clearly and explain what is happening in your scripts to help you tell the story!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb08">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: OBSERVING AND COUNTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of times your cat disappears and how many times it reappears. Does this match the number of blocks you used?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb09">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is helpful to have a conversation about what happens when you place a programming block after the Hide block. Sometimes children have trouble understanding why they cannot see their character complete a script after it has disappeared.</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that a Start on Green Flag block will reset a character’s position, but it will not make a hidden character visible.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec17"><a id="page_40"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb10">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 3: MAKE YOUR CAT TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Next, you’ll make your cat turn right (clockwise) or left (counterclockwise).</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec20">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll create another new project and learn how to use the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks to tilt your cat clockwise or counterclockwise. See how many times your cat has to turn right or left to make a full circle. Then try thinking of other ways you could use these blocks!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec21"><a id="page_34"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. From the home screen, tap the plus sign to make a new project.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block from the blue blocks palette to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_35"></a>
 3. Change the number input, and tap the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block to see how the cat responds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Experiment to figure out what number will make the cat turn upside down. Then figure out what the number should be to make the cat turn a full circle.</p>
<p class="order">4. Don’t forget to start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block so that the cat returns to a vertical position before turning.</p>
<p class="order">5. Now try the same thing with the <strong>Turn Left</strong>
 block!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec22">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Notice that you can drag the cat around on the screen with your finger, and this will reset the cat’s starting position. You can’t rotate the cat with your finger, though! You have to use a motion block to do that.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec23">

 <strong>ACTIVITY 4: LET’S PLAY HIDE-AND-SEEK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">The cat in this activity is playing a game of hide-and-seek. The cat will disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec24">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 , you used a purple block to make a character say something. In this activity, you will learn how to use the purple Hide and Show blocks to make the cat disappear and reappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, but don’t snap them together yet. Tap the <strong>Hide</strong>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb07">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Why does your cat keep disappearing? Think of a story about why your cat is disappearing and reappearing, and share this story with a friend. Remember to speak clearly and explain what is happening in your scripts to help you tell the story!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb08">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: OBSERVING AND COUNTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of times your cat disappears and how many times it reappears. Does this match the number of blocks you used?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb09">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is helpful to have a conversation about what happens when you place a programming block after the Hide block. Sometimes children have trouble understanding why they cannot see their character complete a script after it has disappeared.</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that a Start on Green Flag block will reset a character’s position, but it will not make a hidden character visible.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec17"><a id="page_40"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb10">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb14">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: BUILDING NEW VOCABULARY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>
 —that is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and then improving the program.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indentb">Let’s explore the meaning of this number a little more.</p>
<p class="order">1. Tap the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button at the top of the screen to show the grid.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_30"></a>
 You will see a grid appear on the stage. This grid will help you keep track of where your characters are on the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now tap your script again. See what happens when the cat moves from one spot to another on the stage? The blue square will move with your cat, and the blue numbered circles will indicate the cat’s new position on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Try to make your cat visit every corner of the stage by using the first four motion blocks in the blue blocks palette.</p>
<p class="order">4. If you start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block and you run the script by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, the cat will reset itself to its starting position before the script runs.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_31"></a>
 This will make it easier for you to make changes in your script and retest it, since the cat will always start from the same location. You can change the cat’s starting position by dragging the cat to another location on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">5. When you are finished having the cat visit all four corners of the stage, save your project by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button (). You’ll return to the home screen, where you can access all of your projects and make new ones.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec18">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There is no block for diagonal movement in ScratchJr. If you want to move the cat to a corner of the screen, you will have to move it to that spot with motion blocks for horizontal steps and vertical steps.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec19">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you have multiple motion blocks of the same kind in a row, see if you can simplify your script by changing the number input.</p>
<p class="indent">Experiment with the Hop block and see what happens when you change the number input.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Notice that changing the number input to 4 will not have the same effect as putting two Hop blocks next to each other.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">This is because the number input on a Hop block controls how high a character will hop, not how many times a character will hop.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb01">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: SPELLING A NAME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you’ve programmed your cat to move, come up with a name for the cat! Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to go to the paint editor, and replace the word <em>Cat</em>
 at the top with your cat’s name. Think about how each letter sounds as you try to spell it.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb02">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: SEEING HOW MANY WAYS YOU CAN GET TO 10</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">See if you can calculate which number on the grid the cat will end up on after you run your script. How many different scripts can you create that will make the cat move to that particular location?</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: there are many different ways to write a script and get to 10! Play around with changing the number inputs for the motion blocks to see what happens.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb03">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Children may have trouble understanding that one motion block can be used to make a character move several steps. Try setting up these two scripts to show how they make a character move the same distance.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb14">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: BUILDING NEW VOCABULARY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>
 —that is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and then improving the program.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="order">1. Tap the <strong>Grid</strong>
 button at the top of the screen to show the grid.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_30"></a>
 You will see a grid appear on the stage. This grid will help you keep track of where your characters are on the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now tap your script again. See what happens when the cat moves from one spot to another on the stage? The blue square will move with your cat, and the blue numbered circles will indicate the cat’s new position on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Try to make your cat visit every corner of the stage by using the first four motion blocks in the blue blocks palette.</p>
<p class="order">4. If you start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block and you run the script by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, the cat will reset itself to its starting position before the script runs.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_31"></a>
 This will make it easier for you to make changes in your script and retest it, since the cat will always start from the same location. You can change the cat’s starting position by dragging the cat to another location on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">5. When you are finished having the cat visit all four corners of the stage, save your project by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button (). You’ll return to the home screen, where you can access all of your projects and make new ones.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec18">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There is no block for diagonal movement in ScratchJr. If you want to move the cat to a corner of the screen, you will have to move it to that spot with motion blocks for horizontal steps and vertical steps.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec19">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you have multiple motion blocks of the same kind in a row, see if you can simplify your script by changing the number input.</p>
<p class="indent">Experiment with the Hop block and see what happens when you change the number input.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Notice that changing the number input to 4 will not have the same effect as putting two Hop blocks next to each other.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">This is because the number input on a Hop block controls how high a character will hop, not how many times a character will hop.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_32"><a id="page_32" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb01">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: SPELLING A NAME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you’ve programmed your cat to move, come up with a name for the cat! Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to go to the paint editor, and replace the word <em>Cat</em>
 at the top with your cat’s name. Think about how each letter sounds as you try to spell it.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb02">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: SEEING HOW MANY WAYS YOU CAN GET TO 10</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">See if you can calculate which number on the grid the cat will end up on after you run your script. How many different scripts can you create that will make the cat move to that particular location?</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: there are many different ways to write a script and get to 10! Play around with changing the number inputs for the motion blocks to see what happens.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb03">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Children may have trouble understanding that one motion block can be used to make a character move several steps. Try setting up these two scripts to show how they make a character move the same distance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec15"><a id="page_33"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 3: MAKE YOUR CAT TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Next, you’ll make your cat turn right (clockwise) or left (counterclockwise).</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec20">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll create another new project and learn how to use the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks to tilt your cat clockwise or counterclockwise. See how many times your cat has to turn right or left to make a full circle. Then try thinking of other ways you could use these blocks!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec21"><a id="page_34"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. From the home screen, tap the plus sign to make a new project.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block from the blue blocks palette to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_35"></a>
 3. Change the number input, and tap the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block to see how the cat responds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Experiment to figure out what number will make the cat turn upside down. Then figure out what the number should be to make the cat turn a full circle.</p>
<p class="order">4. Don’t forget to start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block so that the cat returns to a vertical position before turning.</p>
<p class="order">5. Now try the same thing with the <strong>Turn Left</strong>
 block!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec22">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Notice that you can drag the cat around on the screen with your finger, and this will reset the cat’s starting position. You can’t rotate the cat with your finger, though! You have to use a motion block to do that.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec23">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See whether you can make the cat do a cartwheel by making it turn and move forward <em>at the same time</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: use two scripts for this and start both scripts at the same time with a Start on Green Flag block. You can also use this trick with Move Right and Move Up blocks to make the cat move diagonally!</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb04">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: DESCRIBING FEELINGS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of a story about why your cat is spinning. Is the cat happy? Sad? Dizzy? Explain your project to a friend, and make sure they understand why your cat is feeling that way.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb05">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TELLING TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of how a clock’s hands move around its face, and compare that direction to the direction of the cat when it turns. Which one of the turn blocks—Turn Left or Turn Right—moves the cat in the same direction as a clock’s hands?</p>
<p class="indent">See how many times the cat has to turn to go a quarter of the way around a circle. If you double the number input, will the cat turn halfway around the circle?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb06">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can think of the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks in terms of a clock face. Each turn moves the cat “one hour”—that is, one-twelfth of the full circle.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec16"><a id="page_37"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 4: LET’S PLAY HIDE-AND-SEEK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">The cat in this activity is playing a game of hide-and-seek. The cat will disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec24">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 , you used a purple block to make a character say something. In this activity, you will learn how to use the purple Hide and Show blocks to make the cat disappear and reappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, but don’t snap them together yet. Tap the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to see what happens. Now tap the <strong>Show</strong>
 block. These blocks make a character disappear and reappear.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_38"></a>
 3. Now drag two more sets of <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, and snap them onto the first set to make a script that causes the cat to disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the script to see how your cat plays hide-and-seek.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec26">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you combine motion blocks with the Hide and Show blocks, you will see that your cat can still move even when it’s hidden!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec27">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to make your cat disappear and then reappear at another place on the screen. Can you make your cat disappear and then reappear twice, each time moving to a new place on the screen? How about three times?</p>
<p class="indent">Try out other purple looks blocks, such as Grow and Shrink, to see how they change your cat’s appearance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">How large can you make the cat? How small can you make it? Notice what happens when you change the number input on these blocks. See if you can get the cat back to its original size. See whether the Start on Green Flag block has any effect on the cat’s size.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb14">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: BUILDING NEW VOCABULARY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>
 —that is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and then improving the program.</p>
</div>

</html>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_30"></a>
 You will see a grid appear on the stage. This grid will help you keep track of where your characters are on the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now tap your script again. See what happens when the cat moves from one spot to another on the stage? The blue square will move with your cat, and the blue numbered circles will indicate the cat’s new position on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">3. Try to make your cat visit every corner of the stage by using the first four motion blocks in the blue blocks palette.</p>
<p class="order">4. If you start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block and you run the script by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, the cat will reset itself to its starting position before the script runs.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_31"></a>
 This will make it easier for you to make changes in your script and retest it, since the cat will always start from the same location. You can change the cat’s starting position by dragging the cat to another location on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">5. When you are finished having the cat visit all four corners of the stage, save your project by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button (). You’ll return to the home screen, where you can access all of your projects and make new ones.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec18">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There is no block for diagonal movement in ScratchJr. If you want to move the cat to a corner of the screen, you will have to move it to that spot with motion blocks for horizontal steps and vertical steps.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec19">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you have multiple motion blocks of the same kind in a row, see if you can simplify your script by changing the number input.</p>
<p class="indent">Experiment with the Hop block and see what happens when you change the number input.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Notice that changing the number input to 4 will not have the same effect as putting two Hop blocks next to each other.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">This is because the number input on a Hop block controls how high a character will hop, not how many times a character will hop.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_32"><a id="page_32" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb01">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: SPELLING A NAME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you’ve programmed your cat to move, come up with a name for the cat! Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to go to the paint editor, and replace the word <em>Cat</em>
 at the top with your cat’s name. Think about how each letter sounds as you try to spell it.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb02">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: SEEING HOW MANY WAYS YOU CAN GET TO 10</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">See if you can calculate which number on the grid the cat will end up on after you run your script. How many different scripts can you create that will make the cat move to that particular location?</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: there are many different ways to write a script and get to 10! Play around with changing the number inputs for the motion blocks to see what happens.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb03">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Children may have trouble understanding that one motion block can be used to make a character move several steps. Try setting up these two scripts to show how they make a character move the same distance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec15"><a id="page_33"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 3: MAKE YOUR CAT TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Next, you’ll make your cat turn right (clockwise) or left (counterclockwise).</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec20">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll create another new project and learn how to use the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks to tilt your cat clockwise or counterclockwise. See how many times your cat has to turn right or left to make a full circle. Then try thinking of other ways you could use these blocks!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec21"><a id="page_34"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. From the home screen, tap the plus sign to make a new project.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block from the blue blocks palette to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_35"></a>
 3. Change the number input, and tap the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block to see how the cat responds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Experiment to figure out what number will make the cat turn upside down. Then figure out what the number should be to make the cat turn a full circle.</p>
<p class="order">4. Don’t forget to start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block so that the cat returns to a vertical position before turning.</p>
<p class="order">5. Now try the same thing with the <strong>Turn Left</strong>
 block!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec22">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Notice that you can drag the cat around on the screen with your finger, and this will reset the cat’s starting position. You can’t rotate the cat with your finger, though! You have to use a motion block to do that.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec23">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See whether you can make the cat do a cartwheel by making it turn and move forward <em>at the same time</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: use two scripts for this and start both scripts at the same time with a Start on Green Flag block. You can also use this trick with Move Right and Move Up blocks to make the cat move diagonally!</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_36"><a id="page_36" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb04">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: DESCRIBING FEELINGS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of a story about why your cat is spinning. Is the cat happy? Sad? Dizzy? Explain your project to a friend, and make sure they understand why your cat is feeling that way.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb05">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TELLING TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of how a clock’s hands move around its face, and compare that direction to the direction of the cat when it turns. Which one of the turn blocks—Turn Left or Turn Right—moves the cat in the same direction as a clock’s hands?</p>
<p class="indent">See how many times the cat has to turn to go a quarter of the way around a circle. If you double the number input, will the cat turn halfway around the circle?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb06">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can think of the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks in terms of a clock face. Each turn moves the cat “one hour”—that is, one-twelfth of the full circle.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec16"><a id="page_37"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 4: LET’S PLAY HIDE-AND-SEEK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">The cat in this activity is playing a game of hide-and-seek. The cat will disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec24">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 , you used a purple block to make a character say something. In this activity, you will learn how to use the purple Hide and Show blocks to make the cat disappear and reappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, but don’t snap them together yet. Tap the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to see what happens. Now tap the <strong>Show</strong>
 block. These blocks make a character disappear and reappear.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_38"></a>
 3. Now drag two more sets of <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, and snap them onto the first set to make a script that causes the cat to disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the script to see how your cat plays hide-and-seek.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec26">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you combine motion blocks with the Hide and Show blocks, you will see that your cat can still move even when it’s hidden!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec27">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to make your cat disappear and then reappear at another place on the screen. Can you make your cat disappear and then reappear twice, each time moving to a new place on the screen? How about three times?</p>
<p class="indent">Try out other purple looks blocks, such as Grow and Shrink, to see how they change your cat’s appearance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">How large can you make the cat? How small can you make it? Notice what happens when you change the number input on these blocks. See if you can get the cat back to its original size. See whether the Start on Green Flag block has any effect on the cat’s size.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_39"><a id="page_39" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb07">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Why does your cat keep disappearing? Think of a story about why your cat is disappearing and reappearing, and share this story with a friend. Remember to speak clearly and explain what is happening in your scripts to help you tell the story!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb08">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: OBSERVING AND COUNTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of times your cat disappears and how many times it reappears. Does this match the number of blocks you used?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb09">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is helpful to have a conversation about what happens when you place a programming block after the Hide block. Sometimes children have trouble understanding why they cannot see their character complete a script after it has disappeared.</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that a Start on Green Flag block will reset a character’s position, but it will not make a hidden character visible.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec17"><a id="page_40"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_43"><a id="page_43" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb10">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

<p class="noindent">The cat in this activity is playing a game of hide-and-seek. The cat will disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec24">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 , you used a purple block to make a character say something. In this activity, you will learn how to use the purple Hide and Show blocks to make the cat disappear and reappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, but don’t snap them together yet. Tap the <strong>Hide</strong>

<p class="order"><a id="page_38"></a>
 3. Now drag two more sets of <strong>Hide</strong>

<p class="order">4. Tap the script to see how your cat plays hide-and-seek.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec26">
<strong>HINTS</strong>

<p class="noindent">If you combine motion blocks with the Hide and Show blocks, you will see that your cat can still move even when it’s hidden!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec27">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb07">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Why does your cat keep disappearing? Think of a story about why your cat is disappearing and reappearing, and share this story with a friend. Remember to speak clearly and explain what is happening in your scripts to help you tell the story!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb08">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: OBSERVING AND COUNTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of times your cat disappears and how many times it reappears. Does this match the number of blocks you used?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb09">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is helpful to have a conversation about what happens when you place a programming block after the Hide block. Sometimes children have trouble understanding why they cannot see their character complete a script after it has disappeared.</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that a Start on Green Flag block will reset a character’s position, but it will not make a hidden character visible.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb10">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

</p>
<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>
 —that is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and then improving the program.</p>
</div>

<p class="order">3. Try to make your cat visit every corner of the stage by using the first four motion blocks in the blue blocks palette.</p>
<p class="order">4. If you start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block and you run the script by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, the cat will reset itself to its starting position before the script runs.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_31"></a>
 This will make it easier for you to make changes in your script and retest it, since the cat will always start from the same location. You can change the cat’s starting position by dragging the cat to another location on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">5. When you are finished having the cat visit all four corners of the stage, save your project by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>

</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time.

All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb14">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: BUILDING NEW VOCABULARY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>
 —that is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and then improving the program.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="order">4. If you start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block and you run the script by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, the cat will reset itself to its starting position before the script runs.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_31"></a>
 This will make it easier for you to make changes in your script and retest it, since the cat will always start from the same location. You can change the cat’s starting position by dragging the cat to another location on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">5. When you are finished having the cat visit all four corners of the stage, save your project by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button (). You’ll return to the home screen, where you can access all of your projects and make new ones.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec18">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There is no block for diagonal movement in ScratchJr. If you want to move the cat to a corner of the screen, you will have to move it to that spot with motion blocks for horizontal steps and vertical steps.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec19">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you have multiple motion blocks of the same kind in a row, see if you can simplify your script by changing the number input.</p>
<p class="indent">Experiment with the Hop block and see what happens when you change the number input.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Notice that changing the number input to 4 will not have the same effect as putting two Hop blocks next to each other.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">This is because the number input on a Hop block controls how high a character will hop, not how many times a character will hop.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb01">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: SPELLING A NAME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you’ve programmed your cat to move, come up with a name for the cat! Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to go to the paint editor, and replace the word <em>Cat</em>
 at the top with your cat’s name. Think about how each letter sounds as you try to spell it.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb02">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: SEEING HOW MANY WAYS YOU CAN GET TO 10</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">See if you can calculate which number on the grid the cat will end up on after you run your script. How many different scripts can you create that will make the cat move to that particular location?</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: there are many different ways to write a script and get to 10! Play around with changing the number inputs for the motion blocks to see what happens.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb03">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Children may have trouble understanding that one motion block can be used to make a character move several steps. Try setting up these two scripts to show how they make a character move the same distance.</p>

</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec15"><a id="page_33"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 3: MAKE YOUR CAT TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Next, you’ll make your cat turn right (clockwise) or left (counterclockwise).</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec20">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll create another new project and learn how to use the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks to tilt your cat clockwise or counterclockwise. See how many times your cat has to turn right or left to make a full circle. Then try thinking of other ways you could use these blocks!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec21"><a id="page_34"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. From the home screen, tap the plus sign to make a new project.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block from the blue blocks palette to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_35"></a>
 3. Change the number input, and tap the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block to see how the cat responds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Experiment to figure out what number will make the cat turn upside down. Then figure out what the number should be to make the cat turn a full circle.</p>
<p class="order">4. Don’t forget to start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block so that the cat returns to a vertical position before turning.</p>
<p class="order">5. Now try the same thing with the <strong>Turn Left</strong>
 block!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec22">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Notice that you can drag the cat around on the screen with your finger, and this will reset the cat’s starting position. You can’t rotate the cat with your finger, though! You have to use a motion block to do that.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec23">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See whether you can make the cat do a cartwheel by making it turn and move forward <em>at the same time</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: use two scripts for this and start both scripts at the same time with a Start on Green Flag block. You can also use this trick with Move Right and Move Up blocks to make the cat move diagonally!</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: DESCRIBING FEELINGS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of a story about why your cat is spinning. Is the cat happy? Sad? Dizzy? Explain your project to a friend, and make sure they understand why your cat is feeling that way.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb05">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TELLING TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of how a clock’s hands move around its face, and compare that direction to the direction of the cat when it turns. Which one of the turn blocks—Turn Left or Turn Right—moves the cat in the same direction as a clock’s hands?</p>
<p class="indent">See how many times the cat has to turn to go a quarter of the way around a circle. If you double the number input, will the cat turn halfway around the circle?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb06">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can think of the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks in terms of a clock face. Each turn moves the cat “one hour”—that is, one-twelfth of the full circle.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: BUILDING NEW VOCABULARY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi"><a id="page_31"></a>
 This will make it easier for you to make changes in your script and retest it, since the cat will always start from the same location. You can change the cat’s starting position by dragging the cat to another location on the stage.</p>
<p class="order">5. When you are finished having the cat visit all four corners of the stage, save your project by tapping the <strong>Home</strong>
 button (). You’ll return to the home screen, where you can access all of your projects and make new ones.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec18">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There is no block for diagonal movement in ScratchJr. If you want to move the cat to a corner of the screen, you will have to move it to that spot with motion blocks for horizontal steps and vertical steps.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec19">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you have multiple motion blocks of the same kind in a row, see if you can simplify your script by changing the number input.</p>
<p class="indent">Experiment with the Hop block and see what happens when you change the number input.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Notice that changing the number input to 4 will not have the same effect as putting two Hop blocks next to each other.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">This is because the number input on a Hop block controls how high a character will hop, not how many times a character will hop.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_32"><a id="page_32" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb01">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: SPELLING A NAME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you’ve programmed your cat to move, come up with a name for the cat! Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to go to the paint editor, and replace the word <em>Cat</em>
 at the top with your cat’s name. Think about how each letter sounds as you try to spell it.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb02">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: SEEING HOW MANY WAYS YOU CAN GET TO 10</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">See if you can calculate which number on the grid the cat will end up on after you run your script. How many different scripts can you create that will make the cat move to that particular location?</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: there are many different ways to write a script and get to 10! Play around with changing the number inputs for the motion blocks to see what happens.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb03">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Children may have trouble understanding that one motion block can be used to make a character move several steps. Try setting up these two scripts to show how they make a character move the same distance.</p>

</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec15"><a id="page_33"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 3: MAKE YOUR CAT TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Next, you’ll make your cat turn right (clockwise) or left (counterclockwise).</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec20">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll create another new project and learn how to use the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks to tilt your cat clockwise or counterclockwise. See how many times your cat has to turn right or left to make a full circle. Then try thinking of other ways you could use these blocks!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec21"><a id="page_34"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. From the home screen, tap the plus sign to make a new project.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block from the blue blocks palette to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_35"></a>
 3. Change the number input, and tap the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block to see how the cat responds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Experiment to figure out what number will make the cat turn upside down. Then figure out what the number should be to make the cat turn a full circle.</p>
<p class="order">4. Don’t forget to start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block so that the cat returns to a vertical position before turning.</p>
<p class="order">5. Now try the same thing with the <strong>Turn Left</strong>
 block!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec22">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Notice that you can drag the cat around on the screen with your finger, and this will reset the cat’s starting position. You can’t rotate the cat with your finger, though! You have to use a motion block to do that.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec23">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See whether you can make the cat do a cartwheel by making it turn and move forward <em>at the same time</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: use two scripts for this and start both scripts at the same time with a Start on Green Flag block. You can also use this trick with Move Right and Move Up blocks to make the cat move diagonally!</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb04">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: DESCRIBING FEELINGS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of a story about why your cat is spinning. Is the cat happy? Sad? Dizzy? Explain your project to a friend, and make sure they understand why your cat is feeling that way.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb05">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TELLING TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of how a clock’s hands move around its face, and compare that direction to the direction of the cat when it turns. Which one of the turn blocks—Turn Left or Turn Right—moves the cat in the same direction as a clock’s hands?</p>
<p class="indent">See how many times the cat has to turn to go a quarter of the way around a circle. If you double the number input, will the cat turn halfway around the circle?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb06">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can think of the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks in terms of a clock face. Each turn moves the cat “one hour”—that is, one-twelfth of the full circle.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 4: LET’S PLAY HIDE-AND-SEEK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">The cat in this activity is playing a game of hide-and-seek. The cat will disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec24">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 , you used a purple block to make a character say something. In this activity, you will learn how to use the purple Hide and Show blocks to make the cat disappear and reappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, but don’t snap them together yet. Tap the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to see what happens. Now tap the <strong>Show</strong>
 block. These blocks make a character disappear and reappear.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_38"></a>
 3. Now drag two more sets of <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, and snap them onto the first set to make a script that causes the cat to disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the script to see how your cat plays hide-and-seek.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec26">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you combine motion blocks with the Hide and Show blocks, you will see that your cat can still move even when it’s hidden!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec27">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to make your cat disappear and then reappear at another place on the screen. Can you make your cat disappear and then reappear twice, each time moving to a new place on the screen? How about three times?</p>
<p class="indent">Try out other purple looks blocks, such as Grow and Shrink, to see how they change your cat’s appearance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">How large can you make the cat? How small can you make it? Notice what happens when you change the number input on these blocks. See if you can get the cat back to its original size. See whether the Start on Green Flag block has any effect on the cat’s size.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="sbpage_39"><a id="page_39" style=";color:black;"></a>
 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb07">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Why does your cat keep disappearing? Think of a story about why your cat is disappearing and reappearing, and share this story with a friend. Remember to speak clearly and explain what is happening in your scripts to help you tell the story!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb08">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: OBSERVING AND COUNTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of times your cat disappears and how many times it reappears. Does this match the number of blocks you used?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb09">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is helpful to have a conversation about what happens when you place a programming block after the Hide block. Sometimes children have trouble understanding why they cannot see their character complete a script after it has disappeared.</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that a Start on Green Flag block will reset a character’s position, but it will not make a hidden character visible.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec17"><a id="page_40"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb10">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb07">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Why does your cat keep disappearing? Think of a story about why your cat is disappearing and reappearing, and share this story with a friend. Remember to speak clearly and explain what is happening in your scripts to help you tell the story!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb08">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: OBSERVING AND COUNTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of times your cat disappears and how many times it reappears. Does this match the number of blocks you used?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb09">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is helpful to have a conversation about what happens when you place a programming block after the Hide block. Sometimes children have trouble understanding why they cannot see their character complete a script after it has disappeared.</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that a Start on Green Flag block will reset a character’s position, but it will not make a hidden character visible.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb10">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

</p>
<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>
 —that is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and then improving the program.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec18">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">There is no block for diagonal movement in ScratchJr. If you want to move the cat to a corner of the screen, you will have to move it to that spot with motion blocks for horizontal steps and vertical steps.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec19">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you have multiple motion blocks of the same kind in a row, see if you can simplify your script by changing the number input.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb14">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: BUILDING NEW VOCABULARY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>
 —that is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and then improving the program.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">There is no block for diagonal movement in ScratchJr. If you want to move the cat to a corner of the screen, you will have to move it to that spot with motion blocks for horizontal steps and vertical steps.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec19">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you have multiple motion blocks of the same kind in a row, see if you can simplify your script by changing the number input.</p>
<p class="indent">Experiment with the Hop block and see what happens when you change the number input.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Notice that changing the number input to 4 will not have the same effect as putting two Hop blocks next to each other.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">This is because the number input on a Hop block controls how high a character will hop, not how many times a character will hop.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb01">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: SPELLING A NAME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you’ve programmed your cat to move, come up with a name for the cat! Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to go to the paint editor, and replace the word <em>Cat</em>
 at the top with your cat’s name. Think about how each letter sounds as you try to spell it.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb02">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: SEEING HOW MANY WAYS YOU CAN GET TO 10</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">See if you can calculate which number on the grid the cat will end up on after you run your script. How many different scripts can you create that will make the cat move to that particular location?</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: there are many different ways to write a script and get to 10! Play around with changing the number inputs for the motion blocks to see what happens.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb03">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Children may have trouble understanding that one motion block can be used to make a character move several steps. Try setting up these two scripts to show how they make a character move the same distance.</p>

</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec15"><a id="page_33"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 3: MAKE YOUR CAT TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Next, you’ll make your cat turn right (clockwise) or left (counterclockwise).</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec20">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll create another new project and learn how to use the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks to tilt your cat clockwise or counterclockwise. See how many times your cat has to turn right or left to make a full circle. Then try thinking of other ways you could use these blocks!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec21"><a id="page_34"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. From the home screen, tap the plus sign to make a new project.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block from the blue blocks palette to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_35"></a>
 3. Change the number input, and tap the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block to see how the cat responds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Experiment to figure out what number will make the cat turn upside down. Then figure out what the number should be to make the cat turn a full circle.</p>
<p class="order">4. Don’t forget to start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block so that the cat returns to a vertical position before turning.</p>
<p class="order">5. Now try the same thing with the <strong>Turn Left</strong>
 block!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec22">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Notice that you can drag the cat around on the screen with your finger, and this will reset the cat’s starting position. You can’t rotate the cat with your finger, though! You have to use a motion block to do that.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec23">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See whether you can make the cat do a cartwheel by making it turn and move forward <em>at the same time</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: use two scripts for this and start both scripts at the same time with a Start on Green Flag block. You can also use this trick with Move Right and Move Up blocks to make the cat move diagonally!</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb04">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: DESCRIBING FEELINGS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of a story about why your cat is spinning. Is the cat happy? Sad? Dizzy? Explain your project to a friend, and make sure they understand why your cat is feeling that way.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb05">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TELLING TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of how a clock’s hands move around its face, and compare that direction to the direction of the cat when it turns. Which one of the turn blocks—Turn Left or Turn Right—moves the cat in the same direction as a clock’s hands?</p>
<p class="indent">See how many times the cat has to turn to go a quarter of the way around a circle. If you double the number input, will the cat turn halfway around the circle?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb06">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can think of the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks in terms of a clock face. Each turn moves the cat “one hour”—that is, one-twelfth of the full circle.</p>

</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>

 block to see what happens. Now tap the <strong>Show</strong>
 block. These blocks make a character disappear and reappear.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_38"></a>
 3. Now drag two more sets of <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, and snap them onto the first set to make a script that causes the cat to disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the script to see how your cat plays hide-and-seek.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec26">

</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you combine motion blocks with the Hide and Show blocks, you will see that your cat can still move even when it’s hidden!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec27">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec20">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll create another new project and learn how to use the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks to tilt your cat clockwise or counterclockwise.

 <strong>ACTIVITY 4: LET’S PLAY HIDE-AND-SEEK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">The cat in this activity is playing a game of hide-and-seek. The cat will disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec24">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 , you used a purple block to make a character say something. In this activity, you will learn how to use the purple Hide and Show blocks to make the cat disappear and reappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, but don’t snap them together yet. Tap the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to see what happens. Now tap the <strong>Show</strong>
 block. These blocks make a character disappear and reappear.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_38"></a>
 3. Now drag two more sets of <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, and snap them onto the first set to make a script that causes the cat to disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the script to see how your cat plays hide-and-seek.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec26">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you combine motion blocks with the Hide and Show blocks, you will see that your cat can still move even when it’s hidden!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec27">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to make your cat disappear and then reappear at another place on the screen. Can you make your cat disappear and then reappear twice, each time moving to a new place on the screen? How about three times?</p>
<p class="indent">Try out other purple looks blocks, such as Grow and Shrink, to see how they change your cat’s appearance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">How large can you make the cat? How small can you make it? Notice what happens when you change the number input on these blocks. See if you can get the cat back to its original size. See whether the Start on Green Flag block has any effect on the cat’s size.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb07">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Why does your cat keep disappearing? Think of a story about why your cat is disappearing and reappearing, and share this story with a friend. Remember to speak clearly and explain what is happening in your scripts to help you tell the story!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb08">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: OBSERVING AND COUNTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of times your cat disappears and how many times it reappears. Does this match the number of blocks you used?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb09">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is helpful to have a conversation about what happens when you place a programming block after the Hide block. Sometimes children have trouble understanding why they cannot see their character complete a script after it has disappeared.</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that a Start on Green Flag block will reset a character’s position, but it will not make a hidden character visible.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb10">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb10">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb14">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: BUILDING NEW VOCABULARY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>
 —that is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and then improving the program.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Experiment with the Hop block and see what happens when you change the number input.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Notice that changing the number input to 4 will not have the same effect as putting two Hop blocks next to each other.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">This is because the number input on a Hop block controls how high a character will hop, not how many times a character will hop.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb01">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: SPELLING A NAME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you’ve programmed your cat to move, come up with a name for the cat! Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to go to the paint editor, and replace the word <em>Cat</em>
 at the top with your cat’s name. Think about how each letter sounds as you try to spell it.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb02">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: SEEING HOW MANY WAYS YOU CAN GET TO 10</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">See if you can calculate which number on the grid the cat will end up on after you run your script. How many different scripts can you create that will make the cat move to that particular location?</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: there are many different ways to write a script and get to 10! Play around with changing the number inputs for the motion blocks to see what happens.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb03">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Children may have trouble understanding that one motion block can be used to make a character move several steps. Try setting up these two scripts to show how they make a character move the same distance.</p>

<p class="noindent">Next, you’ll make your cat turn right (clockwise) or left (counterclockwise).</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec20">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll create another new project and learn how to use the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks to tilt your cat clockwise or counterclockwise. See how many times your cat has to turn right or left to make a full circle. Then try thinking of other ways you could use these blocks!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec21"><a id="page_34"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. From the home screen, tap the plus sign to make a new project.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block from the blue blocks palette to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_35"></a>
 3. Change the number input, and tap the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block to see how the cat responds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Experiment to figure out what number will make the cat turn upside down. Then figure out what the number should be to make the cat turn a full circle.</p>
<p class="order">4. Don’t forget to start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block so that the cat returns to a vertical position before turning.</p>
<p class="order">5. Now try the same thing with the <strong>Turn Left</strong>
 block!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec22">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Notice that you can drag the cat around on the screen with your finger, and this will reset the cat’s starting position. You can’t rotate the cat with your finger, though! You have to use a motion block to do that.</p>

<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book!

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: BUILDING NEW VOCABULARY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>
 —that is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and then improving the program.</p>
</div>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">Notice that changing the number input to 4 will not have the same effect as putting two Hop blocks next to each other.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">This is because the number input on a Hop block controls how high a character will hop, not how many times a character will hop.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb01">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: SPELLING A NAME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Now that you’ve programmed your cat to move, come up with a name for the cat! Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button to go to the paint editor, and replace the word <em>Cat</em>
 at the top with your cat’s name. Think about how each letter sounds as you try to spell it.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb02">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: SEEING HOW MANY WAYS YOU CAN GET TO 10</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">See if you can calculate which number on the grid the cat will end up on after you run your script. How many different scripts can you create that will make the cat move to that particular location?</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: there are many different ways to write a script and get to 10! Play around with changing the number inputs for the motion blocks to see what happens.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb03">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Children may have trouble understanding that one motion block can be used to make a character move several steps. Try setting up these two scripts to show how they make a character move the same distance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec15"><a id="page_33"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 3: MAKE YOUR CAT TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Next, you’ll make your cat turn right (clockwise) or left (counterclockwise).</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec20">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll create another new project and learn how to use the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks to tilt your cat clockwise or counterclockwise. See how many times your cat has to turn right or left to make a full circle. Then try thinking of other ways you could use these blocks!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec21"><a id="page_34"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. From the home screen, tap the plus sign to make a new project.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block from the blue blocks palette to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_35"></a>
 3. Change the number input, and tap the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block to see how the cat responds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Experiment to figure out what number will make the cat turn upside down. Then figure out what the number should be to make the cat turn a full circle.</p>
<p class="order">4. Don’t forget to start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block so that the cat returns to a vertical position before turning.</p>
<p class="order">5. Now try the same thing with the <strong>Turn Left</strong>
 block!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec22">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Notice that you can drag the cat around on the screen with your finger, and this will reset the cat’s starting position. You can’t rotate the cat with your finger, though! You have to use a motion block to do that.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec23">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See whether you can make the cat do a cartwheel by making it turn and move forward <em>at the same time</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: use two scripts for this and start both scripts at the same time with a Start on Green Flag block. You can also use this trick with Move Right and Move Up blocks to make the cat move diagonally!</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb04">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: DESCRIBING FEELINGS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of a story about why your cat is spinning. Is the cat happy? Sad? Dizzy? Explain your project to a friend, and make sure they understand why your cat is feeling that way.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb05">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TELLING TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of how a clock’s hands move around its face, and compare that direction to the direction of the cat when it turns. Which one of the turn blocks—Turn Left or Turn Right—moves the cat in the same direction as a clock’s hands?</p>
<p class="indent">See how many times the cat has to turn to go a quarter of the way around a circle. If you double the number input, will the cat turn halfway around the circle?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb06">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can think of the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks in terms of a clock face. Each turn moves the cat “one hour”—that is, one-twelfth of the full circle.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 4: LET’S PLAY HIDE-AND-SEEK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">The cat in this activity is playing a game of hide-and-seek. The cat will disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec24">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 , you used a purple block to make a character say something. In this activity, you will learn how to use the purple Hide and Show blocks to make the cat disappear and reappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, but don’t snap them together yet. Tap the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to see what happens. Now tap the <strong>Show</strong>
 block. These blocks make a character disappear and reappear.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_38"></a>
 3. Now drag two more sets of <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, and snap them onto the first set to make a script that causes the cat to disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the script to see how your cat plays hide-and-seek.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec26">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you combine motion blocks with the Hide and Show blocks, you will see that your cat can still move even when it’s hidden!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec27">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to make your cat disappear and then reappear at another place on the screen. Can you make your cat disappear and then reappear twice, each time moving to a new place on the screen? How about three times?</p>
<p class="indent">Try out other purple looks blocks, such as Grow and Shrink, to see how they change your cat’s appearance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">How large can you make the cat? How small can you make it? Notice what happens when you change the number input on these blocks. See if you can get the cat back to its original size. See whether the Start on Green Flag block has any effect on the cat’s size.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb07">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Why does your cat keep disappearing? Think of a story about why your cat is disappearing and reappearing, and share this story with a friend. Remember to speak clearly and explain what is happening in your scripts to help you tell the story!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb08">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: OBSERVING AND COUNTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of times your cat disappears and how many times it reappears. Does this match the number of blocks you used?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb09">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is helpful to have a conversation about what happens when you place a programming block after the Hide block. Sometimes children have trouble understanding why they cannot see their character complete a script after it has disappeared.</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that a Start on Green Flag block will reset a character’s position, but it will not make a hidden character visible.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec17"><a id="page_40"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec20">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll create another new project and learn how to use the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks to tilt your cat clockwise or counterclockwise.

<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>

</p>
<p class="noindent">Why does your cat keep disappearing? Think of a story about why your cat is disappearing and reappearing, and share this story with a friend. Remember to speak clearly and explain what is happening in your scripts to help you tell the story!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb08">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: OBSERVING AND COUNTING</strong>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb09">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb10">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

</p>
<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>
 —that is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and then improving the program.</p>

<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb10">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb14">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: BUILDING NEW VOCABULARY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>
 —that is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and then improving the program.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec15"><a id="page_33"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 3: MAKE YOUR CAT TURN!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Next, you’ll make your cat turn right (clockwise) or left (counterclockwise).</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec20">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll create another new project and learn how to use the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks to tilt your cat clockwise or counterclockwise. See how many times your cat has to turn right or left to make a full circle. Then try thinking of other ways you could use these blocks!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec21"><a id="page_34"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. From the home screen, tap the plus sign to make a new project.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block from the blue blocks palette to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_35"></a>
 3. Change the number input, and tap the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block to see how the cat responds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Experiment to figure out what number will make the cat turn upside down. Then figure out what the number should be to make the cat turn a full circle.</p>
<p class="order">4. Don’t forget to start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block so that the cat returns to a vertical position before turning.</p>
<p class="order">5. Now try the same thing with the <strong>Turn Left</strong>
 block!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec22">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Notice that you can drag the cat around on the screen with your finger, and this will reset the cat’s starting position. You can’t rotate the cat with your finger, though! You have to use a motion block to do that.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec23">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See whether you can make the cat do a cartwheel by making it turn and move forward <em>at the same time</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: use two scripts for this and start both scripts at the same time with a Start on Green Flag block. You can also use this trick with Move Right and Move Up blocks to make the cat move diagonally!</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb04">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: DESCRIBING FEELINGS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of a story about why your cat is spinning. Is the cat happy? Sad? Dizzy? Explain your project to a friend, and make sure they understand why your cat is feeling that way.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb05">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TELLING TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of how a clock’s hands move around its face, and compare that direction to the direction of the cat when it turns. Which one of the turn blocks—Turn Left or Turn Right—moves the cat in the same direction as a clock’s hands?</p>
<p class="indent">See how many times the cat has to turn to go a quarter of the way around a circle. If you double the number input, will the cat turn halfway around the circle?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb06">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can think of the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks in terms of a clock face. Each turn moves the cat “one hour”—that is, one-twelfth of the full circle.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 4: LET’S PLAY HIDE-AND-SEEK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">The cat in this activity is playing a game of hide-and-seek. The cat will disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec24">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 , you used a purple block to make a character say something. In this activity, you will learn how to use the purple Hide and Show blocks to make the cat disappear and reappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, but don’t snap them together yet. Tap the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to see what happens. Now tap the <strong>Show</strong>
 block. These blocks make a character disappear and reappear.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_38"></a>
 3. Now drag two more sets of <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, and snap them onto the first set to make a script that causes the cat to disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the script to see how your cat plays hide-and-seek.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec26">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you combine motion blocks with the Hide and Show blocks, you will see that your cat can still move even when it’s hidden!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec27">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to make your cat disappear and then reappear at another place on the screen. Can you make your cat disappear and then reappear twice, each time moving to a new place on the screen? How about three times?</p>
<p class="indent">Try out other purple looks blocks, such as Grow and Shrink, to see how they change your cat’s appearance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">How large can you make the cat? How small can you make it? Notice what happens when you change the number input on these blocks. See if you can get the cat back to its original size. See whether the Start on Green Flag block has any effect on the cat’s size.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb07">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Why does your cat keep disappearing? Think of a story about why your cat is disappearing and reappearing, and share this story with a friend. Remember to speak clearly and explain what is happening in your scripts to help you tell the story!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb08">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: OBSERVING AND COUNTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of times your cat disappears and how many times it reappears. Does this match the number of blocks you used?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb09">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is helpful to have a conversation about what happens when you place a programming block after the Hide block. Sometimes children have trouble understanding why they cannot see their character complete a script after it has disappeared.</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that a Start on Green Flag block will reset a character’s position, but it will not make a hidden character visible.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb10">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>

 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>
 —that is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and then improving the program.</p>

<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll create another new project and learn how to use the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks to tilt your cat clockwise or counterclockwise. See how many times your cat has to turn right or left to make a full circle. Then try thinking of other ways you could use these blocks!</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec21"><a id="page_34"></a>
 <strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. From the home screen, tap the plus sign to make a new project.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block from the blue blocks palette to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_35"></a>
 3. Change the number input, and tap the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block to see how the cat responds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Experiment to figure out what number will make the cat turn upside down. Then figure out what the number should be to make the cat turn a full circle.</p>
<p class="order">4. Don’t forget to start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block so that the cat returns to a vertical position before turning.</p>
<p class="order">5. Now try the same thing with the <strong>Turn Left</strong>
 block!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec22">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Notice that you can drag the cat around on the screen with your finger, and this will reset the cat’s starting position. You can’t rotate the cat with your finger, though! You have to use a motion block to do that.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec23">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See whether you can make the cat do a cartwheel by making it turn and move forward <em>at the same time</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: use two scripts for this and start both scripts at the same time with a Start on Green Flag block. You can also use this trick with Move Right and Move Up blocks to make the cat move diagonally!</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb05">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TELLING TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of how a clock’s hands move around its face, and compare that direction to the direction of the cat when it turns. Which one of the turn blocks—Turn Left or Turn Right—moves the cat in the same direction as a clock’s hands?</p>
<p class="indent">See how many times the cat has to turn to go a quarter of the way around a circle. If you double the number input, will the cat turn halfway around the circle?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb06">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can think of the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks in terms of a clock face. Each turn moves the cat “one hour”—that is, one-twelfth of the full circle.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 4: LET’S PLAY HIDE-AND-SEEK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">The cat in this activity is playing a game of hide-and-seek. The cat will disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec24">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 , you used a purple block to make a character say something. In this activity, you will learn how to use the purple Hide and Show blocks to make the cat disappear and reappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, but don’t snap them together yet. Tap the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to see what happens. Now tap the <strong>Show</strong>
 block. These blocks make a character disappear and reappear.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_38"></a>
 3. Now drag two more sets of <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, and snap them onto the first set to make a script that causes the cat to disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the script to see how your cat plays hide-and-seek.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec26">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you combine motion blocks with the Hide and Show blocks, you will see that your cat can still move even when it’s hidden!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec27">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to make your cat disappear and then reappear at another place on the screen. Can you make your cat disappear and then reappear twice, each time moving to a new place on the screen? How about three times?</p>
<p class="indent">Try out other purple looks blocks, such as Grow and Shrink, to see how they change your cat’s appearance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">How large can you make the cat? How small can you make it? Notice what happens when you change the number input on these blocks. See if you can get the cat back to its original size. See whether the Start on Green Flag block has any effect on the cat’s size.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb07">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Why does your cat keep disappearing? Think of a story about why your cat is disappearing and reappearing, and share this story with a friend. Remember to speak clearly and explain what is happening in your scripts to help you tell the story!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb08">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: OBSERVING AND COUNTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of times your cat disappears and how many times it reappears. Does this match the number of blocks you used?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb09">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is helpful to have a conversation about what happens when you place a programming block after the Hide block. Sometimes children have trouble understanding why they cannot see their character complete a script after it has disappeared.</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that a Start on Green Flag block will reset a character’s position, but it will not make a hidden character visible.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec17"><a id="page_40"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book!

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

<p class="indent">See how many times the cat has to turn to go a quarter of the way around a circle. If you double the number input, will the cat turn halfway around the circle?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb06">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 4: LET’S PLAY HIDE-AND-SEEK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">The cat in this activity is playing a game of hide-and-seek. The cat will disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec24">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 , you used a purple block to make a character say something. In this activity, you will learn how to use the purple Hide and Show blocks to make the cat disappear and reappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, but don’t snap them together yet. Tap the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to see what happens. Now tap the <strong>Show</strong>
 block. These blocks make a character disappear and reappear.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_38"></a>
 3. Now drag two more sets of <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, and snap them onto the first set to make a script that causes the cat to disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the script to see how your cat plays hide-and-seek.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec26">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you combine motion blocks with the Hide and Show blocks, you will see that your cat can still move even when it’s hidden!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec27">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to make your cat disappear and then reappear at another place on the screen. Can you make your cat disappear and then reappear twice, each time moving to a new place on the screen? How about three times?</p>
<p class="indent">Try out other purple looks blocks, such as Grow and Shrink, to see how they change your cat’s appearance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">How large can you make the cat? How small can you make it? Notice what happens when you change the number input on these blocks. See if you can get the cat back to its original size. See whether the Start on Green Flag block has any effect on the cat’s size.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb07">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Why does your cat keep disappearing? Think of a story about why your cat is disappearing and reappearing, and share this story with a friend. Remember to speak clearly and explain what is happening in your scripts to help you tell the story!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb08">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: OBSERVING AND COUNTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of times your cat disappears and how many times it reappears. Does this match the number of blocks you used?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb09">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is helpful to have a conversation about what happens when you place a programming block after the Hide block. Sometimes children have trouble understanding why they cannot see their character complete a script after it has disappeared.</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that a Start on Green Flag block will reset a character’s position, but it will not make a hidden character visible.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: BUILDING NEW VOCABULARY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>
 —that is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and then improving the program.</p>
</div>

<p class="order">1. From the home screen, tap the plus sign to make a new project.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block from the blue blocks palette to the programming area.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_35"></a>
 3. Change the number input, and tap the <strong>Turn Right</strong>
 block to see how the cat responds.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Experiment to figure out what number will make the cat turn upside down. Then figure out what the number should be to make the cat turn a full circle.</p>
<p class="order">4. Don’t forget to start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block so that the cat returns to a vertical position before turning.</p>
<p class="order">5. Now try the same thing with the <strong>Turn Left</strong>
 block!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec22">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Notice that you can drag the cat around on the screen with your finger, and this will reset the cat’s starting position. You can’t rotate the cat with your finger, though! You have to use a motion block to do that.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec23">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See whether you can make the cat do a cartwheel by making it turn and move forward <em>at the same time</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: use two scripts for this and start both scripts at the same time with a Start on Green Flag block. You can also use this trick with Move Right and Move Up blocks to make the cat move diagonally!</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>

<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 4: LET’S PLAY HIDE-AND-SEEK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">The cat in this activity is playing a game of hide-and-seek. The cat will disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec24">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 , you used a purple block to make a character say something. In this activity, you will learn how to use the purple Hide and Show blocks to make the cat disappear and reappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, but don’t snap them together yet. Tap the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to see what happens. Now tap the <strong>Show</strong>

<p class="order"><a id="page_38"></a>
 3. Now drag two more sets of <strong>Hide</strong>

<p class="order">4. Tap the script to see how your cat plays hide-and-seek.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec26">
<strong>HINTS</strong>

<p class="noindent">If you combine motion blocks with the Hide and Show blocks, you will see that your cat can still move even when it’s hidden!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec27">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb10">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>

<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb10">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: BUILDING NEW VOCABULARY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>
 —that is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and then improving the program.</p>

</body>
</html>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">Experiment to figure out what number will make the cat turn upside down. Then figure out what the number should be to make the cat turn a full circle.</p>
<p class="order">4. Don’t forget to start your script with a <strong>Start on Green Flag</strong>
 block so that the cat returns to a vertical position before turning.</p>
<p class="order">5. Now try the same thing with the <strong>Turn Left</strong>
 block!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec22">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Notice that you can drag the cat around on the screen with your finger, and this will reset the cat’s starting position. You can’t rotate the cat with your finger, though! You have to use a motion block to do that.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec23">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See whether you can make the cat do a cartwheel by making it turn and move forward <em>at the same time</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: use two scripts for this and start both scripts at the same time with a Start on Green Flag block. You can also use this trick with Move Right and Move Up blocks to make the cat move diagonally!</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb04">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: DESCRIBING FEELINGS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of a story about why your cat is spinning. Is the cat happy? Sad? Dizzy? Explain your project to a friend, and make sure they understand why your cat is feeling that way.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb05">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TELLING TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of how a clock’s hands move around its face, and compare that direction to the direction of the cat when it turns. Which one of the turn blocks—Turn Left or Turn Right—moves the cat in the same direction as a clock’s hands?</p>
<p class="indent">See how many times the cat has to turn to go a quarter of the way around a circle. If you double the number input, will the cat turn halfway around the circle?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb06">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can think of the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks in terms of a clock face. Each turn moves the cat “one hour”—that is, one-twelfth of the full circle.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 4: LET’S PLAY HIDE-AND-SEEK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">The cat in this activity is playing a game of hide-and-seek. The cat will disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec24">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 , you used a purple block to make a character say something. In this activity, you will learn how to use the purple Hide and Show blocks to make the cat disappear and reappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, but don’t snap them together yet. Tap the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to see what happens. Now tap the <strong>Show</strong>
 block. These blocks make a character disappear and reappear.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_38"></a>
 3. Now drag two more sets of <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, and snap them onto the first set to make a script that causes the cat to disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the script to see how your cat plays hide-and-seek.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec26">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you combine motion blocks with the Hide and Show blocks, you will see that your cat can still move even when it’s hidden!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec27">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to make your cat disappear and then reappear at another place on the screen. Can you make your cat disappear and then reappear twice, each time moving to a new place on the screen? How about three times?</p>
<p class="indent">Try out other purple looks blocks, such as Grow and Shrink, to see how they change your cat’s appearance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">How large can you make the cat? How small can you make it? Notice what happens when you change the number input on these blocks. See if you can get the cat back to its original size. See whether the Start on Green Flag block has any effect on the cat’s size.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb07">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Why does your cat keep disappearing? Think of a story about why your cat is disappearing and reappearing, and share this story with a friend. Remember to speak clearly and explain what is happening in your scripts to help you tell the story!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb08">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: OBSERVING AND COUNTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of times your cat disappears and how many times it reappears. Does this match the number of blocks you used?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb09">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is helpful to have a conversation about what happens when you place a programming block after the Hide block. Sometimes children have trouble understanding why they cannot see their character complete a script after it has disappeared.</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that a Start on Green Flag block will reset a character’s position, but it will not make a hidden character visible.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: DESCRIBING FEELINGS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of a story about why your cat is spinning. Is the cat happy? Sad? Dizzy? Explain your project to a friend, and make sure they understand why your cat is feeling that way.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb05">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TELLING TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of how a clock’s hands move around its face, and compare that direction to the direction of the cat when it turns. Which one of the turn blocks—Turn Left or Turn Right—moves the cat in the same direction as a clock’s hands?</p>
<p class="indent">See how many times the cat has to turn to go a quarter of the way around a circle. If you double the number input, will the cat turn halfway around the circle?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb06">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can think of the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks in terms of a clock face. Each turn moves the cat “one hour”—that is, one-twelfth of the full circle.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 4: LET’S PLAY HIDE-AND-SEEK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">The cat in this activity is playing a game of hide-and-seek. The cat will disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec24">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 , you used a purple block to make a character say something. In this activity, you will learn how to use the purple Hide and Show blocks to make the cat disappear and reappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, but don’t snap them together yet. Tap the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to see what happens. Now tap the <strong>Show</strong>
 block. These blocks make a character disappear and reappear.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_38"></a>
 3. Now drag two more sets of <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, and snap them onto the first set to make a script that causes the cat to disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the script to see how your cat plays hide-and-seek.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec26">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you combine motion blocks with the Hide and Show blocks, you will see that your cat can still move even when it’s hidden!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec27">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to make your cat disappear and then reappear at another place on the screen. Can you make your cat disappear and then reappear twice, each time moving to a new place on the screen? How about three times?</p>
<p class="indent">Try out other purple looks blocks, such as Grow and Shrink, to see how they change your cat’s appearance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">How large can you make the cat? How small can you make it? Notice what happens when you change the number input on these blocks. See if you can get the cat back to its original size. See whether the Start on Green Flag block has any effect on the cat’s size.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb07">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Why does your cat keep disappearing? Think of a story about why your cat is disappearing and reappearing, and share this story with a friend. Remember to speak clearly and explain what is happening in your scripts to help you tell the story!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb08">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: OBSERVING AND COUNTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of times your cat disappears and how many times it reappears. Does this match the number of blocks you used?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb09">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is helpful to have a conversation about what happens when you place a programming block after the Hide block. Sometimes children have trouble understanding why they cannot see their character complete a script after it has disappeared.</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that a Start on Green Flag block will reset a character’s position, but it will not make a hidden character visible.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec17"><a id="page_40"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb10">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

 <strong>
<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb14">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: BUILDING NEW VOCABULARY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>
 —that is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and then improving the program.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="order">5. Now try the same thing with the <strong>Turn Left</strong>
 block!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec22">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Notice that you can drag the cat around on the screen with your finger, and this will reset the cat’s starting position. You can’t rotate the cat with your finger, though! You have to use a motion block to do that.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec23">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">See whether you can make the cat do a cartwheel by making it turn and move forward <em>at the same time</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Hint: use two scripts for this and start both scripts at the same time with a Start on Green Flag block. You can also use this trick with Move Right and Move Up blocks to make the cat move diagonally!</p>

<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>

 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb10">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>

<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>

<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: BUILDING NEW VOCABULARY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 4: LET’S PLAY HIDE-AND-SEEK!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">The cat in this activity is playing a game of hide-and-seek. The cat will disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec24">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 , you used a purple block to make a character say something. In this activity, you will learn how to use the purple Hide and Show blocks to make the cat disappear and reappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, but don’t snap them together yet. Tap the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to see what happens. Now tap the <strong>Show</strong>
 block. These blocks make a character disappear and reappear.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_38"></a>
 3. Now drag two more sets of <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, and snap them onto the first set to make a script that causes the cat to disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the script to see how your cat plays hide-and-seek.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec26">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you combine motion blocks with the Hide and Show blocks, you will see that your cat can still move even when it’s hidden!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec27">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to make your cat disappear and then reappear at another place on the screen. Can you make your cat disappear and then reappear twice, each time moving to a new place on the screen? How about three times?</p>
<p class="indent">Try out other purple looks blocks, such as Grow and Shrink, to see how they change your cat’s appearance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">How large can you make the cat? How small can you make it? Notice what happens when you change the number input on these blocks. See if you can get the cat back to its original size. See whether the Start on Green Flag block has any effect on the cat’s size.</p>

 MAKING CONNECTIONS</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb07">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Why does your cat keep disappearing? Think of a story about why your cat is disappearing and reappearing, and share this story with a friend. Remember to speak clearly and explain what is happening in your scripts to help you tell the story!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb08">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: OBSERVING AND COUNTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of times your cat disappears and how many times it reappears. Does this match the number of blocks you used?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb09">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is helpful to have a conversation about what happens when you place a programming block after the Hide block. Sometimes children have trouble understanding why they cannot see their character complete a script after it has disappeared.</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that a Start on Green Flag block will reset a character’s position, but it will not make a hidden character visible.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec17"><a id="page_40"></a>
 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">

<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: TELLING A STORY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Why does your cat keep disappearing? Think of a story about why your cat is disappearing and reappearing, and share this story with a friend. Remember to speak clearly and explain what is happening in your scripts to help you tell the story!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb08">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: OBSERVING AND COUNTING</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of times your cat disappears and how many times it reappears. Does this match the number of blocks you used?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb09">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">It is helpful to have a conversation about what happens when you place a programming block after the Hide block. Sometimes children have trouble understanding why they cannot see their character complete a script after it has disappeared.</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that a Start on Green Flag block will reset a character’s position, but it will not make a hidden character visible.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb10">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: BUILDING NEW VOCABULARY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>
 —that is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and then improving the program.</p>
</div>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: DESCRIBING FEELINGS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of a story about why your cat is spinning. Is the cat happy? Sad? Dizzy? Explain your project to a friend, and make sure they understand why your cat is feeling that way.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb05">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TELLING TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of how a clock’s hands move around its face, and compare that direction to the direction of the cat when it turns. Which one of the turn blocks—Turn Left or Turn Right—moves the cat in the same direction as a clock’s hands?</p>
<p class="indent">See how many times the cat has to turn to go a quarter of the way around a circle. If you double the number input, will the cat turn halfway around the circle?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb06">

<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, but don’t snap them together yet. Tap the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to see what happens. Now tap the <strong>Show</strong>
 block. These blocks make a character disappear and reappear.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_38"></a>
 3. Now drag two more sets of <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, and snap them onto the first set to make a script that causes the cat to disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the script to see how your cat plays hide-and-seek.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec26">

<p class="noindent">Think of a story about why your cat is spinning. Is the cat happy? Sad? Dizzy? Explain your project to a friend, and make sure they understand why your cat is feeling that way.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb05">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: TELLING TIME</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of how a clock’s hands move around its face, and compare that direction to the direction of the cat when it turns. Which one of the turn blocks—Turn Left or Turn Right—moves the cat in the same direction as a clock’s hands?</p>
<p class="indent">See how many times the cat has to turn to go a quarter of the way around a circle. If you double the number input, will the cat turn halfway around the circle?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb06">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">You can think of the Turn Right and Turn Left blocks in terms of a clock face. Each turn moves the cat “one hour”—that is, one-twelfth of the full circle.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 , you used a purple block to make a character say something. In this activity, you will learn how to use the purple Hide and Show blocks to make the cat disappear and reappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, but don’t snap them together yet. Tap the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to see what happens. Now tap the <strong>Show</strong>
 block. These blocks make a character disappear and reappear.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_38"></a>
 3. Now drag two more sets of <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, and snap them onto the first set to make a script that causes the cat to disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the script to see how your cat plays hide-and-seek.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec26">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you combine motion blocks with the Hide and Show blocks, you will see that your cat can still move even when it’s hidden!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec27">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to make your cat disappear and then reappear at another place on the screen. Can you make your cat disappear and then reappear twice, each time moving to a new place on the screen? How about three times?</p>
<p class="indent">Try out other purple looks blocks, such as Grow and Shrink, to see how they change your cat’s appearance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">How large can you make the cat? How small can you make it? Notice what happens when you change the number input on these blocks. See if you can get the cat back to its original size. See whether the Start on Green Flag block has any effect on the cat’s size.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>

 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: BUILDING NEW VOCABULARY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>
 —that is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and then improving the program.</p>

</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 , you used a purple block to make a character say something. In this activity, you will learn how to use the purple Hide and Show blocks to make the cat disappear and reappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, but don’t snap them together yet. Tap the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to see what happens. Now tap the <strong>Show</strong>
 block. These blocks make a character disappear and reappear.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_38"></a>
 3. Now drag two more sets of <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, and snap them onto the first set to make a script that causes the cat to disappear and then reappear three times.</p>

<p class="order">4. Tap the script to see how your cat plays hide-and-seek.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec26">
<strong>HINTS</strong>

<p class="noindent">If you combine motion blocks with the Hide and Show blocks, you will see that your cat can still move even when it’s hidden!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec27">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to make your cat disappear and then reappear at another place on the screen. Can you make your cat disappear and then reappear twice, each time moving to a new place on the screen? How about three times?</p>

<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>

<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">

</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time.

All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>

 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>

<p class="noindent">In <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 , you used a purple block to make a character say something. In this activity, you will learn how to use the purple Hide and Show blocks to make the cat disappear and reappear.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec25">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="order">1. First, select the purple category of blocks—the looks blocks. These control how a character looks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Drag the <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, but don’t snap them together yet. Tap the <strong>Hide</strong>
 block to see what happens. Now tap the <strong>Show</strong>
 block. These blocks make a character disappear and reappear.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_38"></a>
 3. Now drag two more sets of <strong>Hide</strong>
 and <strong>Show</strong>
 blocks to the programming area, and snap them onto the first set to make a script that causes the cat to disappear and then reappear three times.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Tap the script to see how your cat plays hide-and-seek.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec26">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">If you combine motion blocks with the Hide and Show blocks, you will see that your cat can still move even when it’s hidden!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec27">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to make your cat disappear and then reappear at another place on the screen. Can you make your cat disappear and then reappear twice, each time moving to a new place on the screen? How about three times?</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb10">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>

<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: BUILDING NEW VOCABULARY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>
 —that is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and then improving the program.</p>
</div>

</html>
<p class="noindent">If you combine motion blocks with the Hide and Show blocks, you will see that your cat can still move even when it’s hidden!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec27">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Try to make your cat disappear and then reappear at another place on the screen. Can you make your cat disappear and then reappear twice, each time moving to a new place on the screen? How about three times?</p>
<p class="indent">Try out other purple looks blocks, such as Grow and Shrink, to see how they change your cat’s appearance.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">How large can you make the cat? How small can you make it? Notice what happens when you change the number input on these blocks. See if you can get the cat back to its original size. See whether the Start on Green Flag block has any effect on the cat’s size.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

 <strong>ACTIVITY 5: DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER!</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll make your cat repeat multiple actions on the stage without using multiple blocks of the same kind.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec28">
<strong>WHAT YOU’LL LEARN</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Until now, if you wanted to repeat an action, you had to use several blocks of the same kind or change the number input on a block.</p>
<p class="indent">In this activity, you’ll learn how to use the Repeat block and the Repeat Forever block to repeat one or more actions.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec29">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb13">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: BUILDING NEW VOCABULARY</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb15">
<strong>MATH CONNECTION: COUNTING THE BLOCKS YOU’VE USED</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Count the number of blocks in your project. How many blue (motion), yellow (triggering), and purple (looks) blocks did you use? Create a chart or graph showing the different blocks you used. Which block color did you use the most?</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>
 —that is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and then improving the program.</p>

<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>

<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>

<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time.

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>

<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: BUILDING NEW VOCABULARY</strong>

<p class="noindent">Go over the vocabulary for the different kinds of animals that live on a farm. Can you use any of these new words in your Old MacDonald project?</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you can add text to your project, create characters that look like letters, or even rename existing characters!</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb16">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes children may get frustrated because their character is not moving in the way that they expected. Explain that an important part of the programming process is <em>debugging</em>
 —that is, testing your program, figuring out what went wrong, and then improving the program.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a look at your script from the previous activity:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indentb">The first two blocks (the Hide block and the Show block) make the cat disappear and reappear. This pattern of Hide and Show blocks is then repeated two more times. But rather than use all of these blocks, you can use a Repeat block to make the first pattern run several times.</p>
<p class="order"><a id="page_41"></a>
 1. First, delete the last four blocks of the script by dragging them back to the blocks palette. You are left with only a single Hide block and a single Show block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now, tap the orange category of blocks to reveal the <em>control blocks</em>
 .</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>
 block. Try it! (To stop a repeating script, tap the red stop sign button that replaces the green flag button while a script is running.)</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec30">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time. To delete four of the six Hide and Show blocks from your previous script in one motion, just put your finger on the third block and drag it back to the blocks palette. All of the blocks to the right of that block will move with it.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec31">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

<p class="sidebarp" id="sb10">
<strong>LITERACY CONNECTION: COMPARING YOUR SCRIPTS TO SENTENCES</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script. The blocks light up from left to right because ScratchJr reads your script in the same way you read sentences in a book! Some blocks take longer to run than others, a bit like how some words take longer to say.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb11">
<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>
<p class="sidebarp" id="sb12"><a id="page_44" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>

<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running. The blocks will become a darker shade of their color when they are running. In this picture, the Show block is a darker shade of purple, which means it is currently running.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>

 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">If some characters do not move when you tap the Green Flag button at the top of the screen, double-check that the scripts for all of the characters begin with a Start on Green Flag block.</p>

<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">3. Drag the <strong>Repeat</strong>
 block to the programming area and position it around the two purple looks blocks.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="orderi">You can change the number in the bubble of the Repeat block to whatever you want. If you want the script to do exactly what it did in the previous activity, you would change this number to 3.</p>
<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>

<p class="noindent">You can drag multiple blocks around the programming area at the same time.

<p class="noindent">Put other blocks inside and outside of the Repeat block. Try out some motion blocks from the blue category. Notice how the animation changes depending on whether a block is or is not included in the Repeat block.</p>
<p class="indent">You could also have a Repeat block within a script that ends with a Repeat Forever block. Try it! The entire script will repeat forever, and each time it repeats, the blocks inside the Repeat block will repeat for the number of times specified by the number input.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">
<strong>LOOKING FOR A CHALLENGE?</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Can you put yourself on the farm? Create a character that looks like you! Here’s how you can do it. Tap the new character button, pick a person with a blank face, and tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"></a>
 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>
 button next to the character you chose.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">The paint editor opens. To add your face, tap the Camera tool, and then tap the face of the character.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You’ll now be able to take a photo.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_49"></a>
 Line up your own face so it looks good, and then tap the <strong>Camera</strong>
 button. You’re really in ScratchJr now!</p>

<p class="orderi">You can use a big number to make your cat disappear and reappear many times, but what if you want the cat to disappear and reappear forever? Then, instead of using a Repeat block, you could end your script with the Repeat Forever <a id="page_42"></a>

<p class="noindent">As your cat moves on the stage, you will see that the blocks in your scripts light up one at a time, starting at the left end of the script and ending at the right end of the script.

<p class="noindent">Point out to children that they can follow the flow of a script by looking at the blocks in the programming area while the script is running.

<p class="indent">The next time you run a ScratchJr script, watch closely and you’ll see how the program runs. Seeing the exact action each block performs is one of the advantages of playing a script in the main interface rather than in Presentation Mode.</p>

 <strong>MATH CONNECTION: COMPARING TWO SCRIPTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">Make a script that uses the Repeat block, and make another script that does the same thing but does not use the Repeat block. Compare the two scripts and explain why they do the same thing.</p>

<strong>TIPS FOR GROWN-UPS</strong>
</p>
<p class="noindent">When you wrap a series of blocks in a Repeat block, you will see a gray shadow from the Repeat block appear in the programming area before you drop it. This shadow will show you exactly which blocks will fall inside the Repeat block.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="indent">You can still add blocks in after you’ve dropped the Repeat block, so don’t worry if you can’t get the shadow to wrap around all the blocks you want.</p>

<span class="orange">PROJECT TIME! OLD MACDONALD’S FARM</span>
</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">For this project you will make a farm with three animals and a barn, and you will program the animals to start moving when you tap the Green Flag button. You will use the skills that you learned in this chapter: move, turn, show, hide, and repeat.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec32">
<strong>HOW TO MAKE IT</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindentb">Let’s make a farm with at least three animals.</p>
<p class="order">1. To set the scene, we can find a background that will give the animals a good place to graze. Tap the <strong>Change Background</strong>
 button, tap the farm, and then tap the check mark to load the farm onto the stage.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">2. Now we can add the farm animals. Let’s start with a rabbit. Tap the plus sign under the cat to add a new character. Select the rabbit and then tap the check mark.</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_46"></a>
 3. We want to make the rabbit disappear, reappear, and then move in different directions when we tap the Green Flag button. Drag the following blocks to the programming area, and snap them together to make this script:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order">4. Now that you’ve created a script for the rabbit, can you add more animals to your scene and create programs for them so that they also move when you tap the Green Flag button?</p>
<p class="orderi">Add at least two more animals to your farm, and give them programs to make the animals move around the stage. You might add a chicken that hops around using the Hop block. Or you can add a pig that turns around in circles. Perhaps you might add a cow and use the Move Left and Move Right blocks with a Repeat Forever block to keep it moving.</p>
<p class="orderi">Which animals are going to be on your farm? Add different animals if you want to!</p>
<p class="orderi">If you add a chicken and a pig, your farm will look like this:</p>
<div class="image"></div>
<p class="order"><a id="page_47"></a>
 5. You can see that this farm doesn’t have a cat. To delete the cat from your project, press and hold it. When the red X appears, tap it to delete the cat. You can also delete the cat by pressing and holding it on the stage instead of in the list of characters.</p>
<p class="order">6. You can also see that this farm has a barn. The barn is one of the characters that you can add to your project. Try adding it to your farm too.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec33">
<strong>HINTS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Note that when you have multiple characters in your project, and each character has a script that begins with the Start on Green Flag block, you should start the action by tapping the Green Flag button at the top of the screen. If, instead, you tap the Start on Green Flag block in your script, only the selected character will move.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec34">

 To add your own face to the character, you’ll have to edit it. Tap the <strong>Paintbrush</strong>

			<ul>&#13;
				<li>Learn how to build your own Arduino circuit on a solderless breadboard</li>&#13;
				<li>Explore the features and benefits of a wide range of Arduino-compatible boards</li>&#13;
				<li>Learn about open source hardware</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>We’ll break down the Arduino design into a group of parts, and then you’ll build your own Arduino circuit on a solderless breadboard. Building your own circuit can save you money, especially when you’re working with changing projects and prototypes. You’ll also learn about some new components and circuitry. Then we’ll explore ways to upload sketches to your homemade Arduino that don’t require extra hardware. Finally, we’ll examine the more common alternatives to the Arduino Uno and explore their differences.</p>&#13;
			<h2 class="HeadProject" id="h1-500587c13-0001"><span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_224" title="224"/>Project #36: Creating Your Own Breadboard Arduino</span></h2>&#13;
			<p class="BodyFirst">As your projects and experiments increase in complexity or number, the cost of purchasing Arduino boards for each task can easily get out of hand, especially if you like to work on more than one project at a time. At this point, it’s cheaper and easier to integrate the circuitry of an Arduino board into your project by building an Arduino circuit on a solderless breadboard that you can then expand for your specific project. It should cost less than $10 in parts to reproduce the basic Arduino circuitry on a breadboard (which itself is usually reusable if you’re not too hard on it). It’s easier to make your own if your project has a lot of external circuitry, because it saves you running lots of wires from an Arduino back to the breadboard.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="h2-500587c13-0001">The Hardware</h3>&#13;
			<p class="BodyFirst">To build a minimalist Arduino, you’ll need the following hardware:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li>One breadboard</li>&#13;
				<li>Various connecting wires</li>&#13;
				<li>One 7805 linear voltage regulator</li>&#13;
				<li>One 16 MHz crystal oscillator</li>&#13;
				<li>One ATmega328P-PU microcontroller with Arduino bootloader</li>&#13;
				<li>One 1 µF, 25 V electrolytic capacitor (C1)</li>&#13;
				<li>One 100 µF, 25 V electrolytic capacitor (C2)</li>&#13;
				<li>Two 22 pF, 50 V ceramic capacitors (C3 and C4)</li>&#13;
				<li>One 100 nF, 50 V ceramic capacitor (C5)</li>&#13;
				<li>Two 560 Ω resistors (R1 and R2)</li>&#13;
				<li>One 10 kΩ resistor (R3)</li>&#13;
				<li>Two LEDs of your choice (LED1 and LED2)</li>&#13;
				<li>One push button (S1)</li>&#13;
				<li>One six-way header pin</li>&#13;
				<li>One PP3-type battery snap</li>&#13;
				<li>One 9 V PP3-type battery</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<p>Some of these parts might be new to you. In the following sections, I’ll explain each part and show you an example and a schematic of each.</p>&#13;
			<h4 id="h3-500587c13-0001">7805 Linear Voltage Regulator</h4>&#13;
			<p class="BodyFirst">A <em>linear voltage regulator</em> contains a simple circuit that converts one voltage to another. The regulator included in the parts list is the 7805 type, which can convert a voltage between 7 and 30 V to a fixed 5 V, with a current up to 1 A—perfect for running our breadboard Arduino. <a href="#figure13-1" id="figureanchor13-1">Figure 13-1</a> shows an example of a 7805 in a TO-220 package next to a ruler for scale.</p>&#13;

			<p><a href="#figure13-2" id="figureanchor13-2">Figure 13-2</a> shows the schematic symbol for the 7805. When you’re looking at the labeled side of the 7805, the pin on the left (underneath the letter J) is for input voltage, the center pin connects to GND, and the right-hand pin (underneath the letter G) is the 5 V output connection. The metal tab at the top is drilled to allow it to connect to a larger piece of metal known as a <em>heat sink</em>.<em> </em>We use a heat sink when the circuit draws up to the maximum of 1 A of current, because the 7805 will become quite warm, like a hot coffee, at that level of use. The metal tab is also connected to GND. We will need one 7805 regulator for our example.</p>&#13;
			<h4 id="h3-500587c13-0002">16 MHz Crystal Oscillator</h4>&#13;
			<p class="BodyFirst">More commonly known as simply a <em>crystal</em>, the crystal oscillator creates an electrical signal with a very accurate frequency. In this case, the frequency is 16 MHz. The crystal we’ll use is shown in <a href="#figure13-3" id="figureanchor13-3">Figure 13-3</a>.</p>&#13;

			<p>&#13;
				Crystals are not polarized. Their schematic symbol is shown in <a href="#figure13-4" id="figureanchor13-4">Figure 13-4</a>.</p>&#13;
			<p>The crystal determines the microcontroller’s speed of operation. For example, the microcontroller circuit we’ll be assembling runs at 16 MHz, which means it can execute 16 million processor instructions per second. That doesn’t mean it can execute a line of a sketch or a function that rapidly, however, since it takes many processor instructions to interpret a single line of code.</p>&#13;
			<h4 id="h3-500587c13-0003">Atmel ATmega328P-PU Microcontroller IC</h4>&#13;
			<p class="BodyFirst">As noted in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 2">Chapter 2</span>, a microcontroller is a tiny computer that is the brains of our breadboard Arduino. It contains a processor that executes instructions, various types of memory to hold data and instructions from our sketch, and various ways to send and receive data. An example of the ATmega328P-PU is shown in <a href="#figure13-5" id="figureanchor13-5">Figure 13-5</a>. When looking at the IC in the photo, notice that pin number 1 is at the bottom left of the IC and is marked by a small dot.</p>&#13;

			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_227" title="227"/>Not all microcontrollers contain the Arduino <em>bootloader</em>, the software that allows it to wait for the Arduino IDE to send it a new sketch to run. When choosing a microcontroller to include in a homemade Arduino, be sure to select one that already includes the bootloader. These are generally available from the same retailers that sell Arduino boards, such as Adafruit, PMD Way, and SparkFun.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="h2-500587c13-0002">The Schematic</h3>&#13;
			<p class="BodyFirst"><a href="#figure13-7" id="figureanchor13-7">Figure 13-7</a> shows the circuit schematic.</p>&#13;

			<p>The schematic contains two sections. The first, on the left, is the power supply, which reduces the voltage to a smooth 5 V. You’ll see an LED that is lit when the power is on. The second section, on the right, consists of the microcontroller, the reset button, the programming pins, and another LED. This LED is wired to the ATmega328P-PU pin that is used as Arduino pin 13.</p>&#13;
			<p>&#13;
				Use the schematic to wire up your Arduino. Don’t forget to run the wires to the six-way pin header (shown in <a href="#figure13-8" id="figureanchor13-8">Figure 13-8</a>), represented by the six circles at the bottom of the schematic. We’ll use this connection later in the chapter to upload a sketch to our homemade Arduino.</p>&#13;
			<p>&#13;
				The circuit will be powered using a 9 V battery and matching snap connector, as shown in <a href="#figure13-9" id="figureanchor13-9">Figure 13-9</a>. Connect the red lead of the battery snap connector to the positive (+) point and the black lead to the negative (–) point on the left side of the circuit.</p>&#13;

			<h3 id="h2-500587c13-0003">Running the Sketch</h3>&#13;
			<p class="BodyFirst">Now it’s time to upload a sketch. We’ll start by uploading a simple sketch to blink the LED:</p>&#13;
			<pre><code>// Project 36 - Creating Your Own Breadboard Arduino&#13;
void setup() &#13;
{                 pinMode(13, OUTPUT); &#13;
}&#13;
void loop() &#13;
{ digitalWrite(13, HIGH); delay(1000);            digitalWrite(13, LOW);  delay(1000); &#13;
}</code></pre>&#13;
			<p>You can upload the sketch in one of three ways.</p>&#13;
			<h4 id="h3-500587c13-0005">Using the Microcontroller Swap Method</h4>&#13;
			<p class="BodyFirst">The most inexpensive way to upload a sketch is to remove the microcontroller from an existing Arduino, insert the microcontroller from your homemade Arduino, upload the sketch, and then swap the microcontrollers again.</p>&#13;
			<p>&#13;
				To remove a microcontroller from the Arduino safely, use an IC extractor, as shown in <a href="#figure13-11" id="figureanchor13-11">Figure 13-11</a>.</p>&#13;
				<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_231" title="231"/>&#13;

				</figcaption>&#13;
			</figure>&#13;
			<p>&#13;
				When removing the microcontroller, be sure to pull both ends out evenly and slowly <em>at the same time</em>—and take your time! Removing the component might be difficult, but eventually the microcontroller will come out.</p>&#13;
			<figure>&#13;
				<img alt="f13013" src="image_fi/500587c13/f13013.png"/>&#13;

				</figcaption>&#13;
			</figure>&#13;
			<p>&#13;
				When inserting a microcontroller into the breadboard or your Arduino, you may have to bend the pins a little to make them perpendicular to the body of the microcontroller so that they can slide in easily. To do this, place one side of the component against a flat surface and gently push down; then repeat on the other side, as shown in <a href="#figure13-12" id="figureanchor13-12">Figure 13-12</a>.</p>&#13;
			<p>&#13;
				Finally, when you return the original microcontroller to your Arduino board, remember that the end with the notch should be on the right side, as shown in <a href="#figure13-13" id="figureanchor13-13">Figure 13-13</a>.</p>&#13;
			<h4 id="h3-500587c13-0006">Connecting to an Existing Arduino Board</h4>&#13;
			<p class="BodyFirst">You can also use the USB interface of an Arduino Uno to upload sketches to the microcontroller in your breadboard Arduino. Using this method reduces wear on the Arduino board’s socket and saves you money, because you won’t need to buy a separate USB programming cable.</p>&#13;
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_232" title="232"/>Here’s how to upload a sketch to the microcontroller using the USB interface:</p>&#13;
			<ol class="decimal">&#13;
				<li value="1">Remove the microcontroller from your Arduino Uno and unplug the USB cable.</li>&#13;
				<li value="2">Remove the power (if connected) from the breadboard Arduino circuit.</li>&#13;
				<li value="3">Connect a wire from Arduino digital pin 0 to pin 2 of the breadboard’s ATmega328P-PU; connect another wire from Arduino digital pin 1 to pin 3 of the ATmega328P-PU.</li>&#13;
				<li value="4">Connect the 5 V and GND from the Uno to the matching areas on the breadboard.</li>&#13;
				<li value="5">Connect a wire from Arduino RST to pin 1 of the ATmega328P-PU.</li>&#13;
				<li value="6">Plug the USB cable into the Arduino Uno board.</li>&#13;
			</ol>&#13;
			<p>At this point, the computer should behave as if it were an ordinary Arduino Uno, so you should be able to upload sketches to the breadboard circuit’s microcontroller normally and use the Serial Monitor if necessary.</p>&#13;
			<h4 id="h3-500587c13-0007">Using an FTDI Programming Cable</h4>&#13;
			<p class="BodyFirst">The final method is the easiest, but it requires the purchase of a USB programming cable, known as an <em>FTDI cable </em>(simply because the USB interface circuitry inside is made by a company called FTDI). When purchasing an FTDI cable, make sure it’s the 5 V model, because the 3.3 V model will not work properly. This cable (shown in <a href="#figure13-14" id="figureanchor13-14">Figure 13-14</a>) has a USB plug on one end and a socket with six wires on the other. The USB end of this cable contains circuitry equivalent to the USB interface on an Arduino Uno board. The six-wire socket connects to the header pins shown in Figures 13-7 and 13-8.</p>&#13;
			<figure>&#13;
				<img alt="f13014" src="image_fi/500587c13/f13014.png"/>&#13;
				<figcaption>&#13;
					<p><a id="figure13-14">Figure 13-14</a>: An FTDI cable</p>&#13;
				</figcaption>&#13;
			</figure>&#13;
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_233" title="233"/>When you’re connecting the cable, be sure that the side of the socket with the black wire connects to the GND pin on the breadboard’s header pins. Once the cable is connected, it also supplies power to the circuit, just as a normal Arduino board would do.</p>&#13;
			<p>&#13;
				Before uploading your sketch or using the serial monitor, change the board type to Arduino Duemilanove or Diecimila by choosing <b>Tools</b><span class="MenuArrow">▶</span><b>Board</b> and then selecting the correct microcontroller (<a href="#figure13-15" id="figureanchor13-15">Figure 13-15</a>).</p>&#13;

			<p>Once you have selected a method of uploading, test it by uploading the Project 36 sketch. Now you should be able to design more complex circuits using only a breadboard, which will let you create more projects for less money. You can even build more permanent projects from scratch if you learn to make your own printed circuit boards.</p>&#13;
			<h2 id="h1-500587c13-0002">The Many Arduino and Alternative Boards</h2>&#13;
			<p class="BodyFirst">Although we have been working exclusively with the Arduino Uno board throughout the book, you can choose from many alternative boards. These will vary in physical size, the number of input and output pins, memory space for sketches, and price.</p>&#13;
			<p>&#13;
				One of the crucial differences between boards is the microcontroller used. Current boards generally use the ATmega328 or the ATmega2560 microcontroller, and the Due uses another, more powerful version called the SAM3X8E. The main differences among these (including both versions of the ATmega328) are summarized in <a href="#table13-2" id="tableanchor13-2">Table 13-2</a>.</p>&#13;

			<p>The main parameters used to compare various Arduino-compatible boards are the types of memory they contain and the amount of each type. Following are the three types of memory:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li><em>Flash memory</em> is the space available to store a sketch after it has been compiled and uploaded by the IDE.</li>&#13;
				<li><em>EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable read-only memory)</em> is a small space that can store byte variables, as you’ll learn in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 19">Chapter 19</span>.</li>&#13;
				<li><em>SRAM</em> is the space available to store variables from your programs.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;

					<p>	Many Arduino boards are available in addition to the Uno, and the few described here are only the tip of the iceberg. When you’re planning large or complex projects, don’t be afraid to scale up to the larger Mega boards. By the same token, if you need only a few I/O pins for a more permanent project, consider the Nano or even a LilyPad.</p>&#13;

			<p>Let’s explore the range of available boards.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="h2-500587c13-0004"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_235" title="235"/>Arduino Uno</h3>&#13;
			<p class="BodyFirst">The Uno is currently considered the standard Arduino board. All Arduino shields ever made should be compatible with the Uno. The Uno is considered the easiest-to-use Arduino board due to its built-in USB interface and removable microcontroller.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="h2-500587c13-0005">Freetronics Eleven</h3>&#13;
			<p class="BodyFirst">Many boards on the market emulate the function of the Arduino Uno, and some have even improved on the standard design. One of these is the Freetronics Eleven, shown in <a href="#figure13-16" id="figureanchor13-16">Figure 13-16</a>.</p>&#13;
			<figure>&#13;
				<img alt="f13016" src="image_fi/500587c13/f13016.png"/>&#13;
				<figcaption>&#13;
					<p><a id="figure13-16">Figure 13-16</a>: A Freetronics Eleven</p>&#13;
				</figcaption>&#13;
			</figure>&#13;
			<p>Although the Eleven is completely compatible with the Arduino Uno, it offers several improvements that make it a worthwhile product. The first is the large prototyping area just below the digital I/O pins. This area allows you to construct your own circuit directly on the main board, which can save you space and money since you won’t need to purchase a separate prototyping shield.</p>&#13;
			<p>&#13;
				Second, the transmitter/receiver (TX/RX), power, and D13 LEDs are positioned on the far right of the board; this placement allows them to be visible even when a shield is attached. Finally, the Eleven uses a micro-USB socket, which is much smaller than the standard USB socket used on the Uno. This makes designing your own shield simpler, since you don’t have to worry about your connections bumping into the USB socket. The Eleven is available from <a class="LinkURL" href="http://www.freetronics.com.au/products/eleven/">http://www.freetronics.com.au/products/eleven/</a>.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="h2-500587c13-0006"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_236" title="236"/>The Adafruit Pro Trinket</h3>&#13;
			<p class="BodyFirst">The Adafruit Pro Trinket (<a href="#figure13-17" id="figureanchor13-17">Figure 13-17</a>) is a miniaturized version of the Arduino Uno designed for working with solderless breadboards, wearable electronics, or any situation in which you need a much smaller board.</p>&#13;
			<figure>&#13;
				<img alt="f13017" src="image_fi/500587c13/f13017.png"/>&#13;
				<figcaption>&#13;
					<p><a id="figure13-17">Figure 13-17</a>: An Adafruit Pro Trinket</p>&#13;
				</figcaption>&#13;
			</figure>&#13;
			<p>&#13;
				There are some slight differences from the Arduino Uno (for example, no serial output unless you use an external FTDI cable); however, for the price this board is a great value. The Pro Trinket is available from <a class="LinkURL" href="http://www.adafruit.com/trinket/">http://www.adafruit.com/trinket/</a>.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="h2-500587c13-0007">The Arduino Nano</h3>&#13;
			<p class="BodyFirst">When you need a compact, assembled Arduino-compatible board, the Nano should fit the bill. Also designed to work in a solderless breadboard, the Nano (<a href="#figure13-18" id="figureanchor13-18">Figure 13-18</a>) is a tiny but powerful Arduino.</p>&#13;
			<figure>&#13;
				<img alt="f13018" src="image_fi/500587c13/f13018.png"/>&#13;
				<figcaption>&#13;
					<p><a id="figure13-18">Figure 13-18</a>: An Arduino Nano</p>&#13;
				</figcaption>&#13;
			</figure>&#13;
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_237" title="237"/>The Nano measures only 0.7 inches by 1.77 inches (17.8 mm by 44.9 mm), yet it offers all the functionality of the classic Arduino Duemilanove. Furthermore, it uses the SMD version of the ATmega328P, so it has two extra analog input pins (A6 and A7). The Nano is available from <a class="LinkURL" href="https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-nano/">https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-nano/</a>.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="h2-500587c13-0008">The LilyPad</h3>&#13;
			<p class="BodyFirst">The LilyPad is designed to be integrated into creative projects, such as wearable electronics. In fact, you can actually wash a LilyPad with water and a mild detergent, so it’s ideal to use for lighting up a sweatshirt, for example. The board design is unique, as shown in <a href="#figure13-19" id="figureanchor13-19">Figure 13-19</a>.</p>&#13;
			<figure>&#13;
				<img alt="f13019" src="image_fi/500587c13/f13019.png"/>&#13;
				<figcaption>&#13;
					<p><a id="figure13-19">Figure 13-19</a>: An Arduino LilyPad</p>&#13;
				</figcaption>&#13;
			</figure>&#13;
			<p>The I/O pins on the LilyPad require that wires be soldered to the board, so the LilyPad is more suited for use with permanent projects. As part of its minimalist design, it has no voltage regulation circuitry, so it’s up to the user to provide their own supply between 2.7 and 5.5 V. The LilyPad also lacks a USB interface, so a 5 V FTDI cable is required to upload sketches. You can get Arduino LilyPad or compatible boards from almost any Arduino retailer.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="h2-500587c13-0009">The Arduino Mega 2560</h3>&#13;
			<p class="BodyFirst">When you run out of I/O pins on your Arduino Uno or you need space for much larger sketches, consider a Mega 2560, shown in <a href="#figure13-20" id="figureanchor13-20">Figure 13-20</a>. It is physically a much larger board than the Uno, measuring 4.3 inches by 2.1 inches (109.2 mm by 53.4 mm).</p>&#13;
			<figure>&#13;
				<img alt="f13020" src="image_fi/500587c13/f13020.png"/>&#13;
				<figcaption>&#13;
					<p><a id="figure13-20">Figure 13-20</a>: An Arduino Mega 2560</p>&#13;
				</figcaption>&#13;
			</figure>&#13;
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_238" title="238"/>Although the Mega 2560 board is much larger than the Uno, you can still use most Arduino shields with it, and Mega-sized prototyping shields are available for larger projects that the Uno can’t accommodate. Since the Mega uses the ATmega2560 microcontroller, its memory space and I/O capabilities (as described in <a href="#table13-2">Table 13-2</a>) are much greater than those of the Uno. Additionally, four separate serial communication lines increase its data transmission capabilities. You can get Mega 2560 boards from almost any Arduino retailer.</p>&#13;
			<h3 id="h2-500587c13-0010">The Freetronics EtherMega</h3>&#13;
			<p class="BodyFirst">When you need an Arduino Mega 2560, a microSD card shield, and an Ethernet shield to connect to the internet, your best option is an EtherMega (<a href="#figure13-21" id="figureanchor13-21">Figure 13-21</a>), because it has all these functions on a single board and is less expensive than purchasing each component separately. The EtherMega is available from <a class="LinkURL" href="http://www.freetronics.com/em/">http://www.freetronics.com/em/</a>.</p>&#13;

			</figure>&#13;
			<h3 id="h2-500587c13-0011">The Arduino Due</h3>&#13;
			<p class="BodyFirst">With an 84 MHz processor that can run your sketches much faster, this is the most powerful Arduino board ever released. As you can see in <a href="#figure13-22" id="figureanchor13-22">Figure 13-22</a>, the board is quite like the Arduino Mega 2560, but there is an extra USB port for external devices and different pin labels.</p>&#13;
			<p>&#13;
				Furthermore, the Due has just over 16 times the memory of an Uno board, so you can create really complex and detailed sketches. However, the Due operates only on 3.3 V—so any circuits, shields, or other devices <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_239" title="239"/>connected to the analog or digital pins cannot have a voltage greater than 3.3 V. While you need to be aware of these limitations, generally the benefits of using the Due outweigh the changes in the hardware.</p>&#13;

					<p>	When shopping for your next Arduino board or accessory, be sure to buy from a reputable retailer that offers support and a guarantee. The internet is flooded with cheap alternatives, but manufacturers often cut corners to make these abnormally low-priced products, and you might have no way of seeking recompense if you’re sold a faulty or incorrectly specified product.</p>&#13;

					<h2>Open Source Hardware</h2>&#13;
					<p class="BoxBodyFirst">The Arduino hardware design is released to the public so that anyone can manufacture, modify, distribute, and use it as they see fit. This type of distribution falls under the umbrella of <em>open source hardware</em>—a recent movement that is in opposition to the concept of copyrights and other legal protection of intellectual property. The Arduino team decided to allow its designs to be free for the benefit of the larger hardware community and for the greater good.</p>&#13;
					<p>In the spirit of open source hardware, many organizations that produce accessories for or modifications of the original Arduino boards publish their designs under the same license. This allows for a much faster process of product improvement than would be possible for a single organization developing the product alone.</p>&#13;

			<p class="BodyFirst">This chapter has given you a broader picture of the types of hardware available and introduces the idea of a breadboard Arduino that you build yourself. You’ve seen the parts that make up the Arduino design, and you’ve seen how to build your own Arduino using a solderless breadboard. You now know how to make more than one Arduino-based prototype without having to purchase more boards. You also know about the variety of Arduino boards on the market, and you should be able to select the board that best meets your needs. Finally, you’ve gained an understanding of the open source movement and Arduino’s participation in it.</p>&#13;
			<p>In the next chapter, you’ll learn to use a variety of motors and begin working on your own Arduino-controlled motorized robot!</p>&#13;

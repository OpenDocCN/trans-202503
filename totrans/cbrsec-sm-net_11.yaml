    You can’t reasonably expect to manage other users’ activity within your network,
    especially when they use their own devices. However, there are some strategies

- en: Having strong passwords and using different credentials for every website are
    the best first steps to remaining safe online. Passphrases and password managers
    make it harder for adversaries to guess your passwords and easier for you to manage
    them. *Passphrases* consist of several words, such as *libertyextremecluecustodyjerky*.
    You can make them more challenging to guess by adding uppercase letters, numbers,
    and special characters, but generally speaking, it’s better to have longer passphrases
    that are easy to remember than complex passwords that aren’t. The same rules for
    typical password security still apply. Don’t use personally identifiable information,
    such as birthdays, pets’ or relatives’ names, or the schools you’ve attended.
    Refrain from including words that relate to the current month or season or the
    name of the company you work for. Basically, avoid constructing a passphrase from
    easy-to-guess elements.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Passphrases are longer than passwords, making them more resilient against the
    brute-force attacks adversaries use to crack them. In a *brute-force attack*,
    the attacker tries every possible combination of characters until they find the
    right one. They can do this programmatically, allowing for millions (or *billions*)
    of password guesses per second. The shorter the password and the smaller the *keyspace*
    (the number of character types—letters, numbers, and symbols—available), the less
    time it takes to crack. For example, an eight-character password consisting of
    lowercase letters and numbers would take less than two hours to crack on today’s
    computing hardware. Adding one character increases that time to more than two
    days, and every additional character grows the time it takes to crack the password
    exponentially—a 30-character passphrase’s cracking time approaches infinity with
    the computing power available today.

    store your passwords. A password manager can store hundreds of unique passphrases
    that are accessed by one master passphrase. This practice removes the temptation
    to write passphrases down, which is never a good idea. Several password managers
    are available, such as 1Password ([https://1password.com/](https://1password.com/))
    or LastPass ([https://www.lastpass.com/](https://www.lastpass.com/)).

- en: The best way to convey the value of a password manager is to discuss *credential
    stuffing*, an attack that exploits the fact that most people still use the same
    password across multiple services. When adversaries obtain a list of passwords
    and email addresses during or after a data breach, they try logging in with those
    credentials on various well-known sites and services, and they’re often successful
    because a significant percentage of the password and email address combinations
    are reused on other sites. Users can prevent credential stuffing by using a different
    passphrase for every account and storing those passphrases in a password manager.

- en: Once you’ve created strong passphrases, you should implement *multifactor authentication*
    (sometimes called *two-factor authentication*, *2FA*, or *MFA*) on all accounts
    and services that offer it. While *single-factor authentication* typically requires
    a combination of only two things—your email address or username plus your passphrase—MFA
    requires two or more factors of authentication. Usually, the first factor is something
    you *know*, and the second is either something you *have*, like a hardware or
    software token, or something you *are*, like a fingerprint or other biometric.
    By requiring a second or third authentication factor, adversaries will have an
    exponentially more difficult task when trying to gain access to your accounts
    and systems. Adding a second factor may introduce a minor inconvenience to you
    or your users, but you’ll be much more secure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the most common MFA solutions uses SMS as a second factor, sending the
    user a text message containing a code or one-time password; they then use this
    code to log in to their account or perform certain types of transactions, particularly
    if it’s from a new or unknown device or location. Everyone can receive text messages
    regardless of their phone model or service provider, it’s free or cheap, it’s
    more or less instant, and it alerts you to suspicious activity if you aren’t actively
    trying to log in. The main drawback is that SMS isn’t a secure technology, and
    it’s relatively trivial for an attacker to gain access to someone’s phone number
    and text messages.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, there are software solutions, including Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft
    Authenticator, and even password vaults like 1Password that offer MFA tokens.
    Typically, you’ll download the app to your smartphone and scan or type in a code
    from your service provider (such as your bank or social media) to set up the app.
    When you want to log in, you’ll check the app for an authentication token that
    you’ll use along with your passphrase. The tokens change every 60 seconds. This
    is a significant improvement on SMS as a second factor, as an adversary would
    have to physically access and unlock your mobile device to retrieve the token.
    The rolling tokens also mean the access window is minimal, unlike SMS where access
    windows can be a few minutes long. Software tokens such as these are the most
    convenient and secure MFA option for many users.

- en: Finally, there are hardware tokens, like Yubikey and Google Titan Key. If the
    key isn’t plugged in to your computer, you can’t access the encrypted or protected
    data. Hardware tokens are considered the most hardcore of the MFA solutions because
    losing your hardware key means you can’t access your data. They offer the same
    or better protection as a software token, as an adversary needs physical access,
    but they are the least convenient; most people carry their phones with them, but
    it’s easy to leave a hardware token at home when you need it at the office. Additionally,
    hardware tokens can’t be phished; while SMS and other similar MFA tokens can be
    drawn out of a potential victim via social engineering and phishing attacks, an
    adversary can’t access your hardware key remotely.
